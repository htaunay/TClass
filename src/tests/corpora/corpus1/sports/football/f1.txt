The Italian keeper produced a fine performance - topped by a superb save from Roy Makaay's penalty.

The Dutch side took the lead just before half-time thanks to a header from defender Kevin Hofland but Frank Lampard, captain in the absence of the injured John Terry, levelled in the 79th minute.

Chelsea looked assured in defence, but rarely threatened the home goal in the first half hour, and struggled to use the ball with any effect.

The Dutch side went in front when Jonathan de Guzman's inswinging free kick was met six yards out by Hofland, who headed powerfully past goalkeeper Petr Cech.

Cech was replaced by Cudicini at half-time and Makaay forced him to stretch to his left to keep out his goalward header.
