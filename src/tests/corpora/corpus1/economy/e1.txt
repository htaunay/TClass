The financing for the Alliance Boots and Chrysler buy-outs, two of the biggest private equity-backed deals in the markets, ran into serious difficulties on Wednesday, intensifying fears about the possibility of a credit crunch.

The news affected equity markets. There are fears tighter credit conditions could derail the buy-out boom that has boosted stock values on the assumption that a bid for nearly any company could be imminent.

The eight banks selling £9bn worth of loans for Boots, the biggest buy-out in UK history, threw in the towel on trying to place £5bn in senior loans and sold £1.75bn of more junior debt at far bigger discounts than expected. The size of the discounts more than wiped out their 2–2.5 per cent fees, leaving them with sizeable losses.

In the US, the proposed $20bn financing for Cerberus’s purchase of Chrysler, the US carmaker, also encountered trouble. Banks postponed the sale of $12bn of debt attached to the carmaking operations. They also scaled back and improved terms on $6bn of debt for the carmaker’s financing arm.

Both cases had failed to attract sufficient demand from investors in spite of increased interest rates.

The two deals will linger on banks’ balance sheets, potentially cutting appetite for underwriting fresh leveraged buy-outs.

Problems placing the debt for such big deals could signal that the peak has passed in the recent LBO boom led by private equity companies flush with cash – a view articulated by Marek Gumienny, a managing director at Candover, the UK buy-out firm.

He said he reckoned deal volumes would now slow as a consequence of the turmoil in credit markets. He added that several investment banks were rumoured to have “shut the door” to new loans for leveraged buy-outs in Europe.

He said European private equity deal volumes had “reached a peak” at €62bn in the second quarter.

“The main issue is the amount of debt stuck with underwriters, which could have an effect on deals going forward. We’ve heard rumours that some banks have shut up shop for the summer: no more credit,” he said.

Stock markets reacted late to the news. European and UK stocks both ended the day lower with the FTSE Eurofirst 300 ending 0.9 per cent down and the FTSE 100 falling 0.7 per cent. US stocks were also affected. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gave up early gains. It was only 0.3 per cent higher after news about Chrysler and Boots, and ended the day up 0.4 per cent.

But some bankers insist they are open for business, their underwriting policies unchanged.

Europe has several smaller LBO financing and refinancing deals in the pipeline. The US confronts a supply glut of more than $300bn in bonds and loans poised to hit markets before year’s end.
