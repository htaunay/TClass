the Bahia cocoa zone, alleviating the drought since early
January and improving prospects for the coming temporao,
although normal humidity levels have not been restored,
Comissaria Smith said in its weekly review.
    The dry period means the temporao will be late this year.
    Arrivals for the week ended February 22 were 155,221 bags
of 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5.93
mln against 5.81 at the same stage last year. Again it seems
that cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the
arrivals figures.
    Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to how
much old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has
practically come to an end. With total Bahia crop estimates
around 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln there
are a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers,
middlemen, exporters and processors.
    There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit
for export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in
obtaining +Bahia superior+ certificates.
    In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have
sold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment.
    Comissaria Smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350
cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos.
    Bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and
only limited sales were booked for March shipment at 1,750 to
1,780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named.
    New crop sales were also light and all to open ports with
June/July going at 1,850 and 1,880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrs
under New York july, Aug/Sept at 1,870, 1,875 and 1,880 dlrs
per tonne FOB.
    Routine sales of butter were made. March/April sold at
4,340, 4,345 and 4,350 dlrs.
    April/May butter went at 2.27 times New York May, June/July
at 4,400 and 4,415 dlrs, Aug/Sept at 4,351 to 4,450 dlrs and at
2.27 and 2.28 times New York Sept and Oct/Dec at 4,480 dlrs and
2.27 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said.
    Destinations were the U.S., Covertible currency areas,
Uruguay and open ports.
    Cake sales were registered at 785 to 995 dlrs for
March/April, 785 dlrs for May, 753 dlrs for Aug and 0.39 times
New York Dec for Oct/Dec.
    Buyers were the U.S., Argentina, Uruguay and convertible
currency areas.
    Liquor sales were limited with March/April selling at 2,325
and 2,380 dlrs, June/July at 2,375 dlrs and at 1.25 times New
York July, Aug/Sept at 2,400 dlrs and at 1.25 times New York
Sept and Oct/Dec at 1.25 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith
said.
    Total Bahia sales are currently estimated at 6.13 mln bags
against the 1986/87 crop and 1.06 mln bags against the 1987/88
crop.
    Final figures for the period to February 28 are expected to
be published by the Brazilian Cocoa Trade Commission after
carnival which ends midday on February 27.

1,323 tonnes of cocoa in the 21st week, ended February 26, of
the 1986/87 main crop season, compared with 1,961 tonnes the
previous week and 1,344 tonnes in the 21st week ended March six
of the 1985/86 season, the board said.
    Cumulative purchases so far this season stand at 216,095

prolonged dry spell on the coming Bahian temporao cocoa crop is
rising with trade forecasts generally in the 2.0 mln to 2.5 mln
bag range against 2.5 mln to 3.0 mln a fortnight ago.
    Trade sources told Reuters from the state capital of
Salvador that despite scattered rains since mid-February, which
broke a six week drought, plantations have not picked up as
hoped and very little cocoa is expected to be gathered in the
first three months of the May/September crop.
    The sources said arrivals from May through July might only
reach around 600,000 bags whereas in normal years a figure of
1.0 mln to 1.5 mln bags might be expected.
    Arrivals from then should start to pick up sharply as pods
from current flowering are gathered. However, the sources noted
a late temporao is always more susceptible to pod rot, which
flourishes if conditions turn cold and humid, and which is more
likely from late July on.
    This year's crop is doubly susceptible because poor prices
mean farmers were not encouraged to invest in fertilisers and
insecticides and are also unlikely to treat against pod rot.
    A severe attack of pod rot can cause the loss of over
500,000 bags in a very short period, one source said.
    Because of the increased exposure to pod rot damage,
estimates of the final outcome of the temporao are extremely
vulnerable and production could easily drop to below the 2.0
mln bag mark if the disease hits.
    Although flowering was good following the start of the
rains, pod setting was not up to expectations, possibly because
the drought had caused a drop in the insect population which
pollinates flowers, the sources said.
    However, reports from farms indicate moisture levels are
now generally back to near normal levels and that current
flowering and pod setting is good, which should result in
mature fruit from August through September.
    The sources said they expect no break in the harvesting of
beans between the end of the temporao and the beginning of the
main crop, which officially starts on October 1.
    "The cut-off date is completely artificial. If things go
well from now on we should see heavy harvesting without a break
from August through November or even December," one said.
    If predictions of a 2.0 to 2.5 mln bag temporao prove
accurate this would be below the 2.7 mln bag average for the
past 10 years. The last poor temporao was in 1984 when
prolonged drought and later pod rot cut production to 1.79 mln
bags, the lowest since 1974.
    Good growing conditions the following year produced a
temporao of 3.12 mln bags, just below the 1983 3.17 mln bag
record, while last year's output, which also suffered some
drought damage, was 2.77 mln bags.
    Figures for the coming temporao might be distorted upwards
by the inclusion of undeclared current main crop beans.
    The sources said large quantities of beans are believed to
have been undeclared from this year's record total harvest and
they were unsure how much of this would be unregistered by the
end of the official crop year on April 30.
    Recent official arrivals figures have been swollen by the
inclusion of beans which had been delivered previously to port
warehouses but not declared.
    Because of the high turnover of beans this year,
significant amounts have deteriorated because they were stored
too long at the back of warehouses. Some of these are expected
to be held for mixing in with early temporao arrivals.
    With official arrivals figures for the 1986/87 temporao and
main crops totalling over 6.1 mln bags, and over seven weeks
still to go to the end of the year, the total outturn should be
at least a record 6.5 mln bags if all production is declared,
the sources said.
    This would compare with the previous record set last year
of 6.03 mln.
    However, there is no way of telling how many current crop
beans will be declared after the May 1 start of the temporao
and thus the true size of the 1986/87 harvest may never be
officially registered.

Ministry official confirmed his country's backing for a new
international cocoa pact and said Ivorian delegates would be
present at talks on its buffer stock starting this week.
    The official told Reuters that Ivorian Agriculture Minister
Denis Bra Kanon would attend the opening of the talks, convened
by the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO), in London on
Monday.
    While Bra Kanon is due to return home this week for funeral
ceremonies for a sister of Ivorian President Felix
Houphouet-Boigny, scheduled to be held in the country's capital
Yamoussoukro between March 19-22, senior Ivorian delegates will
be present throughout the London talks, the official said.
    Bra Kanon is chairman of the ICCO Council and rumours that
he or Ivorian delegates might be delayed because of public
mourning in the West African nation helped depress already low
world cocoa prices Friday.
    The official said Ivory Coast continued to support the new
pact, which was agreed in principle last year by most of the
world's cocoa exporters and consumers.
    He also said Bra Kanon would fulfil his duties as ICCO
Council chairman during the talks, scheduled to end on March
27.
    The meeting aims to set rules for the operation of the
pact's buffer stock which producers hope will boost a market
hit by successive world cocoa surpluses.
    Ivory Coast did not participate in the last international
cocoa pact and its decision to join the new accord has sparked
hopes that it will be more successful in supporting prices.
