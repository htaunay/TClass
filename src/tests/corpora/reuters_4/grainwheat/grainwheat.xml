actively considering offering subsidized wheat to the Soviet
Union under the export enhancement program (EEP), senior USDA
officials said.
    However, grain trade analysts said the proposal has not
been ruled out and that an offer might be made, though not in
the very near future.
    "The grain companies are trying to get this fired up again,"
an aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said. "But there
just isn't much talk about it, informally or formally."
    Most analysts interviewed by Reuters were more confident
than USDA officials that bonus wheat would be offered to the
Soviets, even though U.S. officials did not make such an offer
when they held grain talks with Soviet counterparts earlier
this week.
    But administration and private sources agreed that if the
Reagan administration did decide to offer subsidized wheat to
Moscow, it could take several months.
    "I just don't see any proposal like that sailing through any
interagency process," the aide to Lyng said.
    "An export enhancement offer is not consummated overnight,"
said one former USDA official, who noted that the
administration took three months to decide in favor of selling
China wheat under the subsidy program.
    An official representing a large grain trade company said
deliberations within USDA might be nudged along by members of
Congress, a number of whom urged USDA this week to make a wheat
subsidy offer to the Soviets.
    But Lyng's aide said that during a day-long visit to
Capitol Hill yesterday, House members did not press the
secretary on the subsidy question a single time.
    The administration's interagency trade policy review group,
comprised of subcabinet-level officials, has not been asked to
clear a request to offer Moscow wheat under the EEP, officials
at the U.S. Trade Representative's Office said.
    In their talks this week, the two sides discussed the
administration's previous EEP offer but did not talk about any
new initiative. One USDA official who took part in the
consultations this week described them as an exchange of "calm,
basic, factual economics."
    Another USDA official said there was "not even an informal
suggestion or hint" that the Soviets would live up to their
pledge to buy four mln tonnes of wheat this year if they were
granted more favorable terms.
    USDA and private sources agreed that consideration of an
EEP initiative by interagency review groups likely would be
delayed because of disarray within the White House stemming
from the Iran arms affair.

must do their part to help reduce global surpluses and the
recent Australian farm policy proposals are flawed, two U.S.
wheat organizations said.
    The recent Australian proposals were a good starting point
for discussions, "but we do not want the Australians to feel
they are alone in developing an agenda for discussions" on world
grain trade, the president of the National Association of Wheat
Growers, NAWG, and the chairman of U.S. Wheat Associates said
in a letter to U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and U.S.
Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter.
    Future discussions on international wheat trade should
include three topics -- a commitment to privatization of
government-run export trading entities, a commitment to public
disclosure of sales and other terms if government entities are
involved, and a recognition that supply reductions by the U.S.
have kept world prices higher than they otherwise would be, the
two organizations said 
    While the Australian proposals are welcome the two
organizations said they are not in total agreement with their
assessments.
    Australia's proposals, which aim to reduce U.S. target
prices and "quarantine" U.S. wheat stocks, would continue to
place the burden of supply adjustment and reform on U.S.
farmers, they said.
      Other countries, including Australia, have benefitted
from the higher world prices that have resulted from past U.S.
acreage and crop reduction programs, the organizations said.
    "We will not continue to hurt ourselves economically -- and
subsidize foreign wheat production -- by unilaterally stocking
grain and changing programs which protect our growers," Jim
Miller, president of NAWG said.
    "We sincerely hope for some type of agreement among the
world's major grain producing nations to reduce stocks and
restore profitability to agriculture," Miller said.

to speculate that the Reagan administration will offer
subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union, while U.S. Agriculture
Department officials said there was no substance to the
reports.
    "It's pure fiction," said one senior official at USDA's
Foreign Agricultural Service, referring to the rumor that the
administration would make an export enhancement offer to Moscow
in the next two to three weeks.
    An aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng who asked not
to be identified said there was nothing to substantiate the
speculation, which he said was started by "somebody fanning the
(wheat) market." Wheat futures strengthened today, partly on the
basis of the speculation.
    One lobbyist with close connections to the Reagan
administration said a Soviet trade team told private grain
trade officials in New York last week that Moscow would buy as
much as four mln tonnes of U.S. wheat, much of it before
mid-year, if it was "competitively priced."
    Alexander Ivlev, an official with Amtorg, a Soviet trading
organization, told Reuters he had no information to
substantiate the rumors of an imminent wheat subsidy offer, but
said that Moscow "would consider" buying U.S. wheat if it was
competitively priced.
    "We don't care if it is EEP, what we (the Soviets) are
looking for is competitive prices," Ivlev said. "If they (the
administration) are interested in selling it (wheat), they
should find ways to do it."

protection review body, the Industries Assistance Commission
(IAC), will hold a 12-month inquiry into the Australian wheat
industry, Primary Industry Minister John Kerin said.
    The IAC has been asked to report on the need for assistance
to the industry and the nature, duration and extent of any aid,
he said in a statement.
    He said the inquiry will be the first step in setting
marketing arrangements to apply after June 30, 1989, when the
underwriting and pricing provisions of the 1984 Wheat Marketing
Act expire.
    Kerin said the broad-ranging reference would allow a full
examination of all aspects of the wheat-marketing system.
    "The inquiry will be required to take into account changes
which have taken place in the industry as a result of the
agricultural policies of major wheat producing countries and
the industry's capacity to adjust to any recommended changes,"
he said.
    "The inquiry is at an important time for the wheat industry,
as the substantial fall in world prices is likely to trigger
underwriting support from the government for the first time," he
said.
    Kerin was referring to the government's underwriting of the
guaranteed minimum price paid to wheatgrowers by the Australian
Wheat Board near the start of the season.
    The IAC's report will be due at the same time as the
findings of the current Royal Commission into Grain Storage,
Handling and Transport, Kerin said.
    He said the timing of the IAC inquiry would allow its
findings and those of the Royal Commission to be considered in
later negotiations on wheat-marketing arrangements between the
federal and state governments and the industry.

western Soviet Union, Poland and eastern Czechoslovakia through
northern Romania may suffer some winterkill over the next two

    Western USSR winter wheat areas have had only light and
spotty snow and winterkill is possible tonight and tomorrow

    Snow cover is scant in Poland, with only about 50 pct of

    The remaining 50 pct of winter wheat crops do not have snow

in Yugoslavian winter wheat during field travel along a line

Agriculture Department's counselor in Belgrade said in a field

    The report, dated February 26, said there is evidence of
delayed germination in most areas due to late seeding last fall
because of dry conditions.
    However warm temperatures over the past three weeks have
promoted some early growth and will help the crop catch up on
last fall's late seeding, it said.
    Some Yugoslav agriculture officials are concerned about the
situation because warm temperatures have brought the grain out
of dormancy and taken away snow protection a little early, the

reimburse the Australian Wheat Board, AWB, about 132 mln (U.S.)
dlrs to pay wheat farmers for their 1986/87 crop, the U.S.
Agriculture Department said.
    In its report on Export Markets for U.S. Grains, the
department said the sharp fall in world wheat prices has
reduced the export sales revenue of the AWB to levels
insufficient to cover its breakeven export price estimated at
around 98 dlrs per tonne.
     For example the recent large sales of wheat to China (1.5
mln tonnes) and Egypt (2.0 mln tonnes) were well below the
breakeven export price, it said.
    Australian wheat farmers normally receive an advance
payment known as the Guaranteed Minimum Price, GMP, calculated
at 90 pct of the average of estimated returns in the current
year and the two lowest of the previous three years, the
department said.
    In addition, deductions for taxes, freight, handling and
storage are deducted from the GMP the farmer receives.
    But the department said the Australian Bureau of
Agricultural Economics, BAE, predicts wheat production will
drop sharply from 17.8 mln tonnes in 1986/87 to 13.5 mln in
1989/90.
    The decline will result from low world grain prices leading
to shifts to livestock and other crops which could benefit U.S.
wheat exports, the department said.

75,000 tonnes of soft wheat at a subsidized price of between 85

Agriculture Department said.
    The sale sharply undercut the U.S. offer of 112 dlrs per
tonne FOB for 33,000 tonnes of wheat, it said in its latest
report on Export Markets for U.S grains.
    EC sales to Brazil total about 225,000 tonnes during
1986/87 (July-June) in stark contrast to only 50,000 tonnes in
the 1985/86 season, it said.
    The increasing presence of EC wheat in Brazil comes at a
time when the Brazilian Wheat Board, BWB, expects the wheat
import market will expand to 3.4 mln tonnes from the current
forecast of 3.0 mln in the 1986/87 year.
    The BWB cites record consumption and an eventual decline in
domestic production, and says government plans to lower the
guaranteed price of wheat from 242 dlrs per tonne to 180 dlrs
will contribute to greater import demand, the USDA said.
    It said the BWB expects the U.S. to be major supplier of
the additional 400,000 tonnes, but commitments for purchase of
U.S. wheat through two-thirds of 1986/87 year total only
600,000 tonnes versus 700,000 a year ago.

the federal government to sharply cut initial prices paid to
farmers for their wheat, oats, and barley in the crop year
beginning August 1, a board spokesman said.
    The spokesman declined to give the size of the recommended
price drops but said it would not be good news for western
Canadian grain growers.
    "They're all lower," he said. "This is really getting
pretty serious. We're talking nuts and bolts economic survival
and whether it's worthwhile for farmers to put in a crop."
    Farm leaders and economists have estimated the board will
recommend cuts of around 20 pct in the initial prices.
    Farmers receive the initial payment when the grain is
delivered to the elevators used by the wheat board.
    If the wheat board, which markets most of Canada's grain,
obtains higher than expected prices on world markets, the
farmers receive a final payment at the end of the crop year. If
prices are lower, the federal treasury makes up the difference.
    The final decision on the initial prices, usually made in
April, rests with Wheat Board Minister Charles Mayer and the
federal cabinet.
    Last year Mayer cut the initial prices between 19 and 27
pct but last fall the government announced a one billion
Canadian dlr aid program to compensate for the price cuts.

later today to draft a disaster aid bill is expected to spark a
debate between lawmakers who want to expand the 0/92, or
"de-coupling," provision to cover feedgrains, and those who
oppose 0/92 or want it severely limited, Congressional sources
said.
    The disaster aid bill as it now stands calls for a one-year
0/92 pilot program for 1987 crop wheat and the 1988 winter
wheat crop. The bill would allow farmers to forego planting and
still receive 92 pct of deficiency payments.
    The administration has strongly urged that the bill be
expanded to feedgrains and to more than one year.
    It is difficult to tell in what form the 0/92 provision
will emerge from the committee, the sources said.
    Proponents of an expansion of 0/92 maintain there are large
estimated cost savings of such a bill -- ranging from estimates
by the administration of 200 to 500 mln dlrs.
    Opposition to a reopening of the 1985 farm bill at this
time is the major reason cited by those against an expansion of
the bill, committee staffers said.
    The 0/92 plan is scheduled to be discussed at 1530 EST. A
conflicting floor vote delayed the start of the meeting, and
staffers said it may have to be delayed even until next week.
    Such a delay would not bode well for proponents of an
expanded 0/92 program, since spring planting in many areas of
the country will be underway in the next few weeks and signup
for the 1987 wheat and feedgrains program ends March 30.
    Farmers are now making their planting decisions, so
something has to be done quickly if a 0/92 program is to be
implemented, an Agriculture Department source said.
    An expansion of 0/92 to feedgrains was opposed in last
week's subcommittee hearing on the bill, with subcommittee
chairman Dan Glickman, D-Kan., saying that more study of the
consequences of decoupling on feedgrains plantings was
necessary.
    Major commodity groups, including the National Corn
Growers, the American Farm Bureau and the National Cattlemen's
Association, have voiced strong opposition to 0/92.
    But proponents of an expanded 0/92 argue that the bill
currently is not equitable for all grains producers, so it
should be extended to other crops.
    There will be difficulty in limiting 0/92 to wheat, said
Gene Moos, aide to house majority leader Tom Foley, D-Wash.
    Projected cost savings, in the current atmosphere of try to
decrease farm expenditures, would also be hard to ignore in the
debate to expand the 0/92 application, Moos said.
    Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Tex., may be planning to introduce
a bill to restrict 0/92 to only 1987 crop wheat, with the
argument that now is not the time to vote in favor of any major
changes in the farm bill.
    "Stenholm's bill is not a rejection of 0/92, only of the
timing," a congressional staff member said.
    Rep. Arland Stangeland (R-Minn.) is reported to have an
amendment to expand the 0/92 provision to 1987 and 1988
feedgrains.

provision has been postponed until next Tuesday, committee

    The bill contains a provision implementing a 0/92 acreage
reduction plan for 1986 wheat and 1987 winter wheat, thereby
making payments available to farmers who were not able to plant
last year's winter wheat crop because of flooding.
    Controversy exists over whether the 0/92 provisions of the
bill should be expanded, cut back or left as is.

 ]]></BODY><BODY><![CDATA[Key members of the House Agriculture
committee have agreed to scale-back the 0/92 provision of a
pending disaster aid bill to cover only 1987 crop wheat, but a
broader 0/92 proposal is likely to be resurrected later,
Congressional sources said.
    The sources said key lawmakers including Reps. Glenn
English (D-Okla.), and Dan Glickman (D-Kan.) agreed to support
an amendment to be offered next week by Rep. Charles Stenholm
(D-Tex.) which would limit 0/92 only to producers of 1987 crop
winter and spring wheat.
    This would scale-back the 0/92 provision to the original
proposal by English allowing a pilot 0/92 program for 1987
wheat only. That provision was later broadened by the
subcommittee to include 1988 crop winter wheat.
    Under 0/92, a farmer can forego planting a crop but still
collect 92 pct of deficiency payments.
    Earlier today, the House Agriculture committee postponed
until next Tuesday a meeting to consider the disaster aid bill
and 0/92.
    The agreement to limit 0/92 to a wheat pilot program
follows vocal criticism of the proposal by some influential
farm groups who are concerned about the major impact of 0/92,
and by members of Congress wary of reopening the farm bill.
    Congressional sources said there has not been enough time
to study the implications of a broad 0/92.
    "The timing (of the proposal) is off," said one aide to a
House Agriculture committee member.
    However, several Congressional sources said they expect a
broader 0/92 provision to emerge again when the House
Agriculture committee is faced next month with the need to make
spending cuts in the agriculture budget for fiscal 1988 as part
of an overall deficit reduction package.
    Gene Moos, aide to House Majority leader Tom Foley
(D-Wash.), predicted agriculture's share of budget cuts may
exceed one billion dlrs.
    A broader 0/92 might be resurrected later because both the
Congressional Budget Office and the Reagan administration
estimate it would result in significant budget savings.
    A U.S. Agriculture Department official said 0/92 for all
1987 crops would save 300 to 400 mln dlrs and more than 1.5
billion dlrs over five years.
    Another factor which could affect the 0/92 debate is the
approach of planting season, Congressional sources said.
    Some officials said it already is late for implementation
of a 0/92 in 1987 because farm program signup ends March 31 for
wheat and feedgrains.
    If Congress approved 0/92 later in the year sign-up either
would have to be extended or reopened, sources said.

feedgrains will likely delay offering their proposals if a
disaster aid bill before the House Agriculture Committee is
scaled back to include only 1987 winter wheat, congressional
sources said.
    The disaster aid bill, introduced by Rep. Glenn English
(D-Okla.), sparked sharp controversy with its proposals to
implement a 0/92 program for 1987 wheat and 1988 winter wheat.
    An agreement has been reached to trim the bill back to 1987
wheat, but supporters of a 0/92 feedgrains plan said even that
scaled-down version would not be equitable for farmers.
    Unless the English bill pertains only to 1987 winter wheat,
it is more than a simple disaster payment and feedgrains should
be treated equally, they said.
   If the bill is narrowed to just winter wheat, then
supporters of a 0/92 feedgrains amendment will probably not
offer their proposals next week, sources said.
   English has agreed to support an amendment by Rep. Charles
Stenholm (R-Tex) to narrow the bill to 1987 wheat only, but
whether he would also back a further reduction is unclear.
    Agricultural aides to English said the congressman's first
choice is to make the option available to all 1987 wheat
farmers. However, if the political reality is that disaster aid
for winter wheat farmers would be unavailable because of
controversy over spring wheat, then English might consider an
even greater cutback in the bill, they said.
    Under a 0/92 plan, farmers could forego planting and still
receive 92 pct of deficiency payments.
    Rep. Arlan Stangeland (R-Minn.) and Harold Volkmer (D-Mo.)
have both expressed interest in expanding the English bill to
include a 0/92 program for feedgrains.
    An aide said Stangeland does not want to reopen the farm
bill, but to be fair to all crops.
    Only a small percentage of spring wheat farmers would
likely sign up for 0/92 since the incentives to plant are
greater than to idle the land, economists said.
    Opponents to a 0/92 feedgrains program argue it is
premature to make major changes in the farm bill and that the
House Agriculture Committee needs to study more closely the
impacts of such a program.

Democrats to target government farm benefits to small- and

House subcommittee today.
    "On balance, this is the best new idea I have seen," said
Rep. Dan Glickman (D-Kan.), Chairman of the House Agriculture
Subcommittee on Wheat, Feedgrains and Soybeans. "This is the
first hard constructive proposal coming out as an alternative
to the (Reagan) administration's farm proposal."
    The plan, offered by Reps. Tim Penny (D-Minn.) and Byron
Dorgan (D-ND), would raise target prices for wheat to 5.00 dlrs
per bushel and for corn to 3.50 dlrs. Producers could receive
deficiency payments on up to 80 pct of normal yield but not
more than on 30,000 bu of corn and 20,000 bu of wheat.
    The proposal also would require acreage reductions of 20
pct, eliminate generic certificates and prohibit persons not
actively engaged in farming from receiving program benefits.
    Dorgan said the bill would save 24 billion dlrs over five
years, protect family farms and eliminate government
accumulation of stocks because nonrecourse loans would be
halted.
    However, Rep. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) said the measure would
"involve the federal government in deciding and defining who a
family farmer is."
    Roberts said the bill, for example, would restrict program
payments to 500 acres of wheat production in western Kansas.

would determine if a person was actively engaged in farming and

approved a bill to enable 1987 winter wheat and feedgrains
farmers hit by midwestern flooding last year to receive at
least 92 pct of their federal income support payments even if
they did not plant.
    The one-time pilot 0/92 program, designed to assist farmers
in Kansas, Oklahoma, Michigan and parts of Missouri, was passed
by a 304-100 vote and sent to the Senate.
    Although the bill includes a narrow version of the 0/92
provision endorsed by the Reagan administration, the U.S.
Agriculture Department withheld its support from the measure.
    USDA said the bill would discourage farmers from buying
crop insurance and fall short of the administration's proposed
broad-scale revision of farm programs.
    The bill would permit winter wheat producers prevented from
planting their 1987 crop last fall to receive 92 pct of the
deficiency payments they would have received.
    To be eligible, winter wheat farmers could not plant a
different crop on that land this spring, although they could
use the land for grazing or to plant hay.
    USDA estimated this provision would save 30 mln dlrs,
largely because of reduced crop forfeitures.
    The bill also would aid about 200 feedgrains producers
along the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers who were prevented
from planting crops this year because of residual damage from
last fall's flooding.
    In addition, the measure would require USDA to make full
payment to farmers eligible for emergency assistance approved
by Congress last fall.
    Currently, because claims have outstripped the 400 mln dlrs
in appropriated funds, USDA plans to offer farmers in the
region 74 cents for every dollar in disaster losses.
    The administration said it opposed the bill because, by
expanding the 400 mln dlrs in disaster relief, it would thwart
efforts to encourage farmers to buy crop insurance as an
alternative to federal disaster assistance.
    USDA also said the 0/92 provisions in the bill were
narrower than the administration's proposal to offer the option
to all major commodities and would produce insignificant
savings.
    USDA said the 0/92 option for 1987 winter wheat farmers
would produce a net savings of about 30 mln dlrs, while the
requirement to compensate fully disaster-struck farmers would
cost about 135 mln dlrs, which must be appropriated by
Congress. The feedgrains provision would cost about five mln
dlrs.
    USDA estimated the overall cost of the bill to be 111 mln
dlrs.
    In January the Senate approved a bill that would make 1987
winter wheat farmers eligible for disaster assistance payments.
    But the Senate bill would not offer the 0/92 option to
wheat and feedgrains producers or raise the 400-mln dlr ceiling
on the disaster assistance program.

have to be cut by an additional one to two billion dlrs, the
chairman of a key house agriculture subcommittee said.
    Implementation of a 0/92 program, a tightening up of the
use of commodity certificates, and reconstitution of farms are
possibilities that will be studied to reduce farm spending,
said Dan Glickman, D-Kans., chairman of the House agriculture
subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feedgrains.
    Speaking at the annual meeting of the National Grain and
Feed Association, Glickman said he learned this week from the
House budget committee that the agriculture committee will have
to reduce the fiscal year 1988 farm budget by up to two billion
dlrs from the 30 billion dlrs level already approved.
    Decisions on how to cut the farm budget will have to be
made very quickly in order to make any impact on the FY 1988
budget, Glickman added.
    Glickman also said his committee will not approve USDA's 
proposal to cut target prices by ten pct per year.
    "The administration's target price proposals are dead in
the water," he said.
    To cut the budget, Glickman said, "everthing is on the
table," except those moves that would reduce farmers' income.
    Glickman offered a list of possibilities that his committee
will study in order to cut farm spending.
    Implementation of a 0/92 program for 1987 winter wheat and
1988 feedgrains crops has been introduced by Glickman, which he
said would result in a 150-200 mln dlr savings for one year.
    Tightening up on the use of generic (in-kind, or "pik')
certificates will also be another option his committee will
study, Glickman said.
    While not committing himself for or against such action, he
said lawmakers have to examine recent government findings which
indicate certificates cost more than cash payments.
    Glickman said rules for the reconstitution of farms and
tightening up of the person definition for annual payment
limitations is another option and could save 100-200 mln dlrs.
    He also said increasing acreage set-aside requirements by
five pct for wheat and feedgrains at program sign-up was a move
that could save about one billion dlrs, but added that he would
not be in favor of such a change.
    Glickman also said that the Export Enhancement Program's,
EEP, spending authority of 1.5 billion dlrs is quickly being
used up, and Congress will have to decide whether to expand
this program while making cuts in other areas.
    Cuts in the EEP program are unlikely, he said.
    "I don't see right now that the EEP will be on the chopping
block," Glickman said.

Department's policy is on offering subsidized wheat to Moscow,
Secretary of State George Shultz told a group of farm leaders
that U.S. products must be competitive in the world market.
    "If we are going to sell our products, whatever they may
be, wheat or anything else, then we have to meet the market,"
Shultz told the board of directors for the National Association
of Wheat Growers.
    "We have to be competitive. It's ridiculous to say that
somebody is going to buy your product if they can get the same
thing at a lower price somewhere else. They just aren't," he
said.
    "That is our approach in the negotiations with the Soviets,
and it must be our approach as we look at the American farm
program and try to figure out what we should do to make it
better," Shultz told the Wheat Growers.
    Schultz said that while he does not favor a situation that
would allow the Soviet housewife to buy food cheaper than the
American housewife, he realizes the importance of American
agricultural products being competitively priced.
    Speculation has been in the market for some time that the
United States is considering offering wheat to the Soviet Union
at subsidized prices.
    Soviet officials have said they would buy U.S. wheat if it
were competitively priced. Agriculture Department officials
have declined to take any official position on the issue.

of State George Shultz after he met with wheat growers that
U.S. agricultural products must be competitively priced was
significant in that he recognized the importance of the Soviet
market and the need for U.S. prices to be at world market
levels, U.S. grain trade industry officials said.
    They said that Shultz's comments, while not explicitly
endorsing subsidized wheat sales to the USSR, were noteworthy
because they were not negative towards such action.
    In response to a query on what the State Department's
position is on selling subsidized wheat to Moscow, Shultz told
the leaders of the National Association of Wheat Growers that
prices must be competitive if the U.S. is going to trade.
    The Soviet Union, the world's largest grain importer, has
bought no U.S. wheat for more than a year, complaining the
price was far above world market levels. A U.S. offer last fall
to sell the Soviets lower-priced wheat through the export
enhancement program, EEP, was also rebuffed due to the price.
    Shultz was said to be adamantly against the U.S. wheat
offer last year and has been reported to be one of the major
obstacles in making another subsidy overture to the Soviet
Union, grain industry sources said.
    Intense speculation the U.S. might make a fresh EEP wheat
offer to the Soviets has boosted grain prices significantly in
recent trading sessions. Kansas City hard wheat futures rose
another 2-1/4 cents by midday at 2.88-1/4 dlrs per bushel,
while CBT March wheat was up 1-1/2 cents at 2.92-1/2 dlrs.
    "I'm not sure this is an about-face, but it's clearly a
recognition that unless we're competitive, we won't sell to the
Soviet Union," said a lobbyst for a major commodity group.
    "We have to be competitive. It's ridiculous to say that
somebody is going to buy your product if they can get the same
thing at a lower price somewhere else," Shultz told the farm
leaders. "That is our approach in negotiations with the
Soviets," he said.
    If those comments do signal that the State Department is no
longer opposed to the U.S. selling wheat to the USSR under EEP,
it certainly improves the chances for an EEP wheat offer to
Moscow, an industry lobbyst said.
    National Wheat Grower's officials were taking a cautious
attitude towards the secretary's comments.
    "His comments were not discouraging, but they didn't in our
judgment promise any immediate action on EEP," an official with
the wheat group said.
    The Wheat Growers official noted, however, that "there is
significance in that fact that we haven't seen any significant
negative commentary on the idea of EEP wheat to the Soviets."
    In a meeting with exporters this week, Secretary of
Agriculture Richard Lyng refused to comment on their request
that the administration offer subsidized wheat to Moscow, the
officials said.
    An aide to USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz, who is
reported to be strongly opposed to EEP wheat to the Soviets,
said that the Shultz comments "are consistent with what he
(Shultz) has taught for years as an economist," but said they
don't necessarily relate to the Soviet Union.
    Amstutz could not be reached for comment, and an aide to
Lyng said Lyng would not comment on Shultz's statements.
    But trade sources were hopeful that the Shultz comments may
indicate some movement towards EEP wheat to Moscow.
    "If he didn't say no, then there's a chance. This is
potentially a positive development," a commodity source said.

decided not to oppose any U.S. wheat subsidy offer to the
Soviet Union and has left the final decision on whether to sell
subsidized wheat to Moscow up to President Reagan and the
Agriculture Department, a State Department official said.
    "Shultz feels like he fought the battle against a subsidy
last summer, and he's not going to the mat again. It's now
basically the USDA who has to make their decisions as to what
they want to do," the official said.
    If USDA decides to go ahead with a subsidy offer to the
Soviet Union, he said, "Shultz will not wage a vigorous
campaign against it. He might not come out in favor of it, but
he won't go to the President and voice his objections."
    In an official statement clarifying Shultz's remarks
yesterday to leaders of the National Association of Wheat
Growers, the State Department said, "Secretary Shultz expressed
his belief that whenever possible, U.S. grain should be
competitive on world markets, including the Soviet Union.
    The Agriculture Department is in the best position to
determine whether consideration should be given at this time to
extending to the Soviets a subsidy under the Export Enhancement
Program."
    Although Shultz will not oppose a wheat subsidy to the
Soviets, there remain obstacles to another subsidy offer to
Moscow, the State Department official said.
    "Everyone in the government agrees that if there is a
subsidy to be offered, we would not offer it unless we had a
firm commitment from the Soviets that they would buy."
    USDA does not want a repetition of last summer when the
USSR baulked at its offer of four mln tonnes of subsidized
wheat, the official, who asked not to be identified, said.
    The Soviets rejected the U.S. offer then on the grounds
that the 13 dlr per tonne subsidy was insufficient to bring
U.S. prices down to competitive levels.
    The Soviets want a higher subsidy offer this time, the
State Department source said.
    "What the Soviets want is something equivalent to the
lowest price being paid by anyone in the world," he said.
    The Soviets argue that they are the best customer of the
U.S. and that they are entitled to the best price, he said.
    Government and commodity sources also said there are
elements in the USDA, most notably undersecretary Daniel
Amstutz, who remain opposed to a wheat subsidy to the Soviets.
    "Subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union is still not a
foregone conclusion," the State Department official said.

forecast to fall to 10.40 mln hectares in 1987/88 from 11.72
mln sown in 1986/87, Australian Wheat Forecasters Pty Ltd (AWF)
said in its first preliminary crop forecast.
    But there was no reason to expect Australian production in
1987/88 would be less than the 16.5 mln tonnes of last year,
the private forecaster said, as crops in New South Wales and
Queensland suffered from poor yields last season.
    Most of the fall in plantings was expected in Western
Australia while state average yields would be assisted by
growers sowing wheat on fallows and rest paddocks, it said.
    The main reason for a low Western Australia estimate was a
poor profit outlook under cost, credit and yield pressures. But
in the eastern states the wheat area should hold up provided
that rainfall between now and June is not less than average,
AWF said.
    Although some farmers were saying they intended to cut back
wheat area by 20 pct, AWF said this was unlikely since they
needed cash flow and there were problems with alternative
crops.
    "The lack of statutory marketing for oilseeds, pulses and
oats is a cause for concern if those crops are to comprise a
high proportion of growers' income," AWF said.
    AWF's state area forecasts in mln hectares, with 1986/87

lifted its estimate for 1986/87 world wheat and coarse grain
production by one mln tonnes to a record 1,377 mln, compared
with 1,351 mln tonnes the previous season.
    In its monthly market report, the IWC said it is leaving
unchanged its forecast of world wheat production for the coming
1987/88 season at between 520 and 530 mln tonnes against a
record 534 mln in 1986/87. The one mln tonne upward revision in
1986/87 wheat production reflects several minor adjustments.
The IWC raised the 1986/87 coarse grain trade figure two mln to
87 mln tonnes. It left wheat trade unchanged at 86 mln.
    The IWC 1986/87 estimate for world trade in wheat and
coarse grain is thus estimated two mln tonnes higher at 173 mln
against 169 mln the previous season with the forecast three mln
rise in Soviet imports offset by small reductions elsewhere.
    The IWC said the area harvested for wheat in 1987/88 is
likely to be down from last year as low world prices and
restrictive national policies measures begin to take effect.
    At least four of the five major exporters expect to see a
drop in wheat sowings without offset in other countries. There
is still potential for even higher average wheat yields but the
IWC said there are increasing signs world output may level off.
    Although it is still early to assess the coarse grain
outlook, the IWC said barley acreage is likely to fall in the
European Community but increase in Canada. U.S. Maize area is
expected lower but oat sowings could rise.
    After damage to its maize crop last year, the Soviet Union
plans to expand this area by as much as 50 pct to over six mln
hectares in a year when many frost damaged wheat fields are
likely to be resown to this and other spring crops. Improved
weather and a further increase in the use of intensive
cultivation methods could therefore see a marked rise in Soviet
maize output in 1987, the IWC said.
    Any reduction in world coarse grain output would be
bolstered by the large carryover stocks from 1986/87, the IWC
said.
    It left its estimates of wheat and coarse grain stocks at
end of different marketing years unchanged at 178 and 210 mln
tonnes, respectively, against 160 and 167 mln a year earlier.
    After record world durum wheat production of 218.8 mln
tonnes last season, the IWC said there are already signs of
another large crop this coming season with higher output
expected in the EC, Canada, the U.S. And North Africa.

surpluses by cutting support prices have met with only partial
success, the International Wheat Council (IWC) says in its
latest monthly report.
    Faster results could be achieved by a policy of reducing
both price and areas, as employed in the United States, the IWC
says in a survey of support prices in the five main wheat
exporters - Argentina, Australia, Canada, the EC and the U.S.
    In some countries, for example Australia and Argentina,
which are highly dependent on wheat shipments for export
income, there may be problems in reducing production.
    A policy of cutting wheat production could lead to
unemployment, with job prospects outside agriculture limited.
Alternative crops may offer inferior returns which could then
lead to lost export revenue and balance of payments problems.
    The IWC outlines three courses of action open to
governments in wheat exporting countries.
    They could continue to support prices in the hope that when
the world economy improves demand for wheat will rise and
surpluses wil be reduced or eliminated.
    Alternatively, support could be limited to wheat which
could be easily sold, without needing to be stored for a long
period.
    This option may prove to be the most politically
unattractive and would result in many producers abandoning
wheat production, the report said.
    The third option would be for governments to distinguish
between the commercial and social aspects of agriculture,
possibly varying support prices according to farm size or
overall production.
    The IWC review covers support prices in the major exporting
countries since 1982. At some time during that period all the
producers cut support prices in response to growing surpluses.
    These changes did not always result in lower export
subsidies as on several occasions currency fluctuations more
than offset lower prices in the domestic currency.
    For example between 1985/86 and 1986/87 the EC intervention
price for bread wheat fell from 209.30 to 179.44 European
currency units (Ecus). It dollar terms, the currency in which
most export transactions are denominated, the intervention
price however rose to 193 dlrs from 168. The high cost of
supporting farm prices has put a strain on national exchequers
and some governments are now searching for ways to cut
expenditure, the report says.
    The proportion of world wheat output produced by the five
major exporters declined in the period covered by the survey
from 40 pct in 1982 to 35 pct in 1987. This was partly due to
increased production in China and India.
    The period saw an upward trend in yields, although this was
countered in the Argentina, the U.S. And Australia by lower
acreages.
    In Argentina a reduction in the sown area of about 20 per
cent was put down to low prices causing producers to switch to
other enterprises, particularly livestock while lower U.S.
Acreages are attributed to official incentives.

interested in purchasing new crop wheat than in booking any
grain for immediate shipment if offered a subsidy on U.S.
wheat, an executive with a major grain export company said.
    Lower prices and the desire to delay any big purchases
until the condition of winter and spring crops is better known
make new crop wheat more attractive, said George Hoffman,
director of commodity analysis for The Pillsbury Company.
    "Pillsbury is assuming that they (Soviets) will be offered
a subsidy and that it will be a subsidy that they can respond
to," Hoffman told Reuters in an interview at an agribusiness
education conference here. But if there are too many
constraints placed on a subsidy offer, the USSR will take less
than an anticipated four mln tonnes, he said.
    Hoffman said Pillsbury's internal statistics put Soviet
Union wheat purchases at only two mln tonnes under a subsidy
offer. However, if a subsidy is offered at competitive levels,
Moscow would likely buy more, he said.
    "If we give the Soviets the same deal as the Chinese, I
expect they'll take it," said Vernon McMinimy, director of
commodity research for A.E. Staley Manufacturing Co.
    McMinimy told Reuters spring weather and its impact on
crops will determine how much wheat Moscow would buy under a
subsidy offer.
    Soviet winter crops did not get off to a good start because
of a dry autumn last year, and because of the severe winter
"they probably have had more damage due to winter weather than
normal," McMinimy said.

tonnes of wheat this year, which would normally come from
Australia, but may be from the United States, the U.S.
Agriculture Department said.
    In its report on Export Markets for U.S. Grains, the
department said with the deregulation of the New Zealand Wheat
Board, which normally imports wheat from Australia, there is
the possibility of wheat purchases from the united states since
the shipping cost between New Zealand and the Eastern Coast of
Australia and the West Coast of the United States are about
equal.

sales by not providing enough specific quality grades to meet
buyer requirements, the Australian Wheat Board (AWB) said.
    "Many AWB customers are becoming increasingly quality
conscious, demanding strict adherence to contractual quality
specifications," the board said in a submission to the Royal
Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport.
    "Many of the specifications are more specific than the
current categories used in Australia," it said.
    The commission is trying to identify ways of saving costs
and boosting efficiency of the grain handling system.
    Australia must rely on quality to retain its wheat market
share because its competitors are supplying cheaper but
lower-quality grades, the AWB submission said.
    It stressed the need to segregate wheat categories at every
stage from receival to shipping.
    Better industrial relations at grain terminals, more
uniform transport systems across the states and extensive stock
control were vital to improved marketing, it said.
    The submission also said Australia's federal system impeded
the AWB's role of coordinating and managing the marketing of
wheat.
    The AWB called for an end to physical and legislative
constraints at state borders that prevent the efficient
transport of grains to other states for shipment.
    "It is essential that wheat moves by the most economic mode
to the nearest efficient port, irrespective of the state in
which the wheat is grown or stored," it said.
    For example, wheat grown in northern New South Wales (NSW)
might move more efficiently to Brisbane, in Queensland, than to
Sydney or Newcastle in New South Wales, it said. Similarly,
southern NSW wheat might better be shipped to Portland or
Geelong, in Victoria.
    Legislation giving state rail authorities a monopoly over
grain shipments was one notable impediment, it said.
    The AWB said the current approach of state-based bulk
handling authorities is not essential, although it said it
favoured the authorities maintaining at least their current
level of control of storage and transport as long as quality
was maintained.
    An appendix on port loading costs showed it cost between
26,500 and 34,700 U.S. Dlrs to load a 50,000-tonne vessel at
various Australian ports compared with 21,200 dlrs at Houston
and 16,300 at Port Cartier, Quebec, for a 60,000-tonner.

decision on applications from the British government for the
release of 200,000 tonnes of intervention feed wheat onto the
British market in May and June, Commission sources said.
    They said last week's cereals management committee agreed
to release 70,000 tonnes of feed wheat through weekly tenders
between April 14 and May 26. It also indicated it planned to
allow the release of another 30,000 tonnes from April 23.
    However, it decided to leave consideration of the release
of further wheat until later.
    The British government had applied for the release of a
further 100,000 tonnes in both May and June from British
intervention stores to prevent market prices rising.
    However, the sources said, the Commission wanted to review
the market situation nearer the time before giving its
approval.
    The Commission was given new powers last year to control
the release of intervention cereals onto the market, the

    Following last week's committee meeting, the U.K. Ministry

additional quantities of intervention wheat would be made
available in May and June. It also said that it was envisaged
that monthly releases would be at least 100,000 tonnes,
depending on the state of the market.
    This lead to the widespread assumption that the Commission

increased its estimate of 1986/87 grain purchases by the Soviet

    In its monthly report on the Soviet grain situation, the
USDA said imports will be higher than earlier estimated because
Soviet grain buyers have been actively purchasing in the last
month.
    USDA said the increased purchasing is "somewhat surprising"
because of recent higher Soviet crop estimates.
    All of the increase in estimated imports will be in corn,
USDA said.
    Of the 28 mln tonnes total, 15 mln tonnes will be wheat, 12
mln tonnes coarse grains, and the remaining one mln tonnes
miscellaneous grains and pulses, USDA said.
    USDA noted that the Soviet winter grain crop suffered
through a severe winter and spring field work has been delayed.
    The severe winter "is believed to have resulted in above
average winter-kill," USDA said.
    Some grain trade analysts have said abnormal winter losses
maybe one reason why the Soviet Union has been actively buying
grain recently.

markets through lack of availability if plantings for the
coming 1987/88 season are significantly reduced, Australian
Wheat Board (AWB) chairman Clinton Condon said.
    "If predictions of a 30 pct decrease in plantings prove
true, Australia may not be able to supply wheat to some of its
valuable markets," he said in a statement.
    Condon did not say who had made the predictions, but an AWB
spokesman said there was a general industry feeling that
farmers, hard hit by low prices and rising costs, could cut
back plantings sharply. Wheat sowing normally begins in May.
    However, Condon said he did not believe plantings would be
cut by as much as 30 pct although he realised many farmers were
facing enormous financial pressures.
    He said the AWB expects the area sown to be about 10.7 mln
hectares, down from 11.3 mln in 1986/87 when the crop was about
16 mln tonnes. Final crop estimates for 1986/87 and planting
intentions for 1987/88 are not yet available.
    If the AWB is unable, because of a short-term cut in
plantings, to meet the needs of the markets it has developed
with much time and effort, it may have great difficulty selling
wheat to those markets in the future, Condon said.
    "Markets which rely on a steady supply of Australian wheat
understand a decrease in production due to drought but they
will have difficulty understanding a deliberate decision to
decrease production," Condon said.
    "If Australia wants wheat to continue as a major export
income earner, governments and government authorities will need
to closely examine ways of contributing to the continuing
viability of the wheat industry," he added.
    Australia's leading wheat markets include China, Egypt,
Iran, Iraq, the Soviet Union and Japan.

spring wheat at Minneapolis and Duluth by 32 cents, he said.
    In addition, USDA cut the Pacific Northwest price of hard
red spring wheat by 31 cents, USDA officials who asked not to
be identified said.
    The officials said hard red spring wheat prices at Chicago,
Denver and Toledo were adjusted by about the same amount as at
Pacific Northwest, Duluth and Minneapolis.
    The price changes should lead to a pickup of PIK and roll
activity, Klopfenstein said. The price change was decided upon
last week and will be effective today, he said.
    Klopfenstein also said the department raised the premiums
on high protein wheat to offset the drop in low protein wheat
prices, meaning the net price on any wheat commanding a protein
premium would remain unchanged.

Shultz said it was up to the Agriculture Department to decide
whether to offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union.
    Shultz told the Newspaper Farm Editors of America that a 
wheat bonus offer to the Soviet Union "is something that I
basically leave to the Agriculture Department to figure out."
    Last year, Shultz spoke out against President Reagan's
decision to offer subsidized U.S. wheat to the Soviet Union --
an offer Moscow spurned.
    "I've always been a little put off by the idea that we would
arrange our food supplies so as to price them in such a way
that the Soviet housewife could buy American-produced food for
less than the American housewife could buy it," Shultz said.
    "It also seems to me that if we are going to sell in world
markets, we have to meet the price," he added.
    Shultz called proposals to broaden the eligibility criteria
of USDA's export enhancement program (EEP) to include all U.S.
customers "questionable."
    An across-the-board EEP would mark a "considerable change" in
the current program, which Shultz said is designed "to say to
other countries that subsidize, particularly the European
Common Market, that we're not going to give up our markets to
those subsidized sales and we'll have a little kit bag that
will meet that competition and hold our markets for our
farmers."
    "If you just go across-the-board and subsidize everything,
that's a different order of program and seems to me quite
questionable," he said.

whether to seek a penalty from Continental Grain Co of the
United States for alleged breach of a wheat shipment contract,
but is also asking the company to expedite shipment of the
cargo, a senior Food Ministry official said.
    The official, who declined to be named, said the company
under a deal agreed to ship 100,000 tonnes of wheat by April 7
and another 100,000 tonnes by April 16. But it shipped only
126,000 tonnes altogether.
    The supplier will have to pay penalty at a rate of two dlrs
per tonne for every delayed day according to a document signed
by both the Food Ministry and the suppliers' agent in Dhaka, he
told Reuters.
    "If they arrange quick shipment, we may take a lenient view,"
the official said. The issue is expected to be decided at a
cabinet meeting scheduled for next Sunday, he added.
    A pro-government Bengali daily "Dainik Janata" reported today
that Continental Grain could face a penalty of 200 mln taka
(6.49 mln dlrs) for alleged failure to maintain shipment
schedule.
    The local agent of Continental Grain, Shafi Ahmed
Choudhury, told Reuters he applied to the Bangladesh government
for an extension of the shipment period because loading of
wheat at London was being delayed due to bad weather and a
faulty elevator at a grain silo. But the government has not yet
granted the extension, he said.
    Choudhury said the freight rate and price of wheat had gone
up after the deal was signed, which resulted in a financial
loss to the company.
    He said he was not "officially informed" of the move to
impose a penalty, although he was "not totally unaware of it."
    Continental Grain officials in New York declined to
comment.

reduction program may be eligible for deficiency payments on 92

    The department said the provision of the Farm Disaster

producers, producers of other types of wheat who were prevented
from planting their 1987 wheat crop because of a 1986 natural
disaster, and all producers who operate farms with program crop

    The department said producers of wheat other than winter
wheat may use the 0/92 option if they were preventedf from
planting their intended acreage with wheat for harvest in 1987

last February, the Senegalese appear ready to take delivery of
a first tranche of 10,500 tonnes of mixed U.S. wheat, the U.S.
Agriculture Department said.
    In its report on U.S. Export Markets for U.S. Grain, the
department noted Senegal had bought 100,000 tonnes of wheat
under the Export Enhancement Program last November, but local
opposition from millers, accustomed to French wheat, has been
delaying deliveries.
    As a result there were a series of baking seminars as well
as the trial batch, in an effort to satisfy local flour millers
and convince key officials of the qualities of U.S. wheat.
    The department said if deliveries of U.S. wheat to Senegal
remain on track, the U.S. could dominate a wheat market that
had been expected to import 140,000 tonnes of mostly French
wheat during the 1987/88 (July-June) season.

urgent need for a U.S. wheat subsidy offer, and it is unlikely
that such an offer will be ma during the U.S./Soviet summit
expected to be held next month, Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng told Reuters.
    In an exclusive interview with Reuters, Lyng said he did
not know if the United States will offer Moscow another wheat
subsidy offer this year or when that offer will be made.
    "Last year it was well into the year before we offered it.
There's been nothing that's taken place to indicate to me that
there's a pressing need on their part for that sort of deal (a
wheat subsidy)."
    When asked if a subsidy would be offered at a U.S./Soviet
summit, Lyng said, "No, I don't think so. I don't think that."
    The Agriculture Secretary said a U.S. wheat subsidy deal to
Moscow would not be the kind of topic appropriate for
discussion at a summit.
    "It would not be the kind of issue that the President or the
Chairman would get into specific negotiations or discussions
about," Lyng said.
    "When Mr. Nikonov (communist party secretary for
agriculture) was here ... he indicated that trade in wheat was
not something that would be discussed with the President of the
United States. He said it's not presidential," Lyng said.
    Lyng said uncertainties about wheat quality in some major
producing areas of the world, volatile wheat prices and the
still unfinished Soviet grain harvest could delay any final
decision on the timing of another wheat subsidy to Moscow.
    The future of the U.S./Soviet long-term grains agreement
will be discussed the first of next year, Lyng said, but the
Agriculture Secretary questioned the benefits of the
long-standing agreement.
    "We've had three years in a row in which the Soviets have
failed to live up to their end of the agreement ... We would
love to continue to keep doing busines with the Soviet Union,
but do we need a long-term agreement. Who benefits from that.
These are some of the questions we need to discuss."
    When asked if he felt the United States has benefitted from
the agreement, Lyng said, "I don't know. It certainly hasn't
been what we had hoped it would be. For three years running
they've (Moscow) failed to live up to what we considered was an
agreement."
