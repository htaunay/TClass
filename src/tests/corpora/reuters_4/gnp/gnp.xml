slow further in 1987, but an improved the trade picture should
keep the country from recession, economists said.
    "The economy is ready for about a 2.0 pct rate of growth
over the course of 1987," said Carl Beigie, Chief Economist at
Dominion Securities Pitfield Ltd.
    Statistics Canada reported that gross domestic product,
grew 3.1 pct in 1986, the fourth year of continuous expansion,
but down from 1985's four pct.
    In the final quarter, GDP, in 1981 prices and at annualized
rates, rose a slight 0.2 pct after expanding 0.8 pct in the
third quarter.
    "Essentially it is a flat performance," said Warren Jestin,
deputy chief economist at the Bank of Nova Scotia.
    Economist Wendy Smith Cork of the brokerage Nesbitt Thomson
Bongard Inc said "it shows the economy is not moving along very
steadily, it's not a very promising number."
    "We weren't surprised, we expected to see one bad quarter
in Canada, but we don't think there will be a recession," she
added.
    The rise in GDP was below the 3.3 pct increase forecast by
Federal Finance Minister Michael Wilson in his budget last
month. He also projected the economy would expand  2.8 pct this
year.
    Many economists are less optimistic, predicting growth will
likely be in the 2.0 to 2.2 pct range.
    Statistics Canada also reported the country's trade
performance deteriorated sharply last year as the deficit in
the current account rose to a record 8.8 billion Canadian dlrs
from the previous year's shortfall of 584 mln dlrs.
    "The sharp increase in the deficit originated from
merchandise trade transactions where imports continued to
advance strongly whereas exports were virtually unchanged," the
federal agency said in a statement.
    The merchandise trade surplus was pared to 10.13 billion
dlrs in 1986 from 17.48 billion dlrs in 1985.
    But economist Cork said the expected upturn in the U.S.
economy will lead to increased demand for Canadian goods, and
help fuel the country's modest expansion. Nearly 80 pct of
Canada's exports are shipped to the U.S. each year.

expects the Canadian economy will grow moderately in the coming
year, despite the near flat growth in the final quarter of
1986.
    "We see moderate growth," Crow told a news conference
following presentation of the central bank's annual report in
the House of Commons today.
    He said there were positive signs of growth in the economy,
particularly the drawdown of business inventories in the fourth
quarter. Yesterday, Statistics Canada reported gross domestic
product expanded a slight 0.2 pct in the quarter.
    Crow reiterated the bank's previous statements that
inflation remains a major priority in setting monetary policy
and said only zero inflation would be acceptable. Canada's
inflation rate is currently hovering around the four pct mark.
    The governor said Canada's banking system remains sound
despite recent concern about exposure by the country's banks in
debt plagued countries such as Brazil.
    "It (the debt problem) is not a happy development but I
think it can be overplayed in terms of its impact," Crow told

German economy is relatively bright, with gross national
product expected to expand by three pct this year, Kiel
University's Institute for World Economy said.
    The GNP forecast by the institute, one of five leading
economic research bodies in West Germany, is more optimistic
than that of the other institutes, some of which have recently
reduced their GNP forecasts to between two and 2.5 pct.
    In a report the Kiel institute said West Germany's export
outlook has not deteriorated fundamentally despite the mark's
strength against the dollar and other major currencies.
    "The danger that exports will slump in 1987 appears, all in
all, limited," the report said. "On the contrary, a slight rise
in exports can be expected."
    The institute said past experience has shown West German
exporters will move to counterbalance currency factors by
cutting costs, trying to penetrate new markets and adjusting
their product ranges.
    They will be aided in 1987 by an expected slight rise in
economic growth in industrial countries. At the same time, the
decline in exports to oil producing countries looks set to slow
this year.
    West German GNP growth in 1987 will be led by renewed
advances in domestic consumption and investment spending, both
of which will in turn be buoyed by an expansionary monetary
policy, the institute said.
    However, it said the labour market would see only a slight
improvement because companies will be reluctant to hire
additional workers due to higher labour costs caused partly by
agreed reductions in working hours.
    The institute cautioned that the expansionary stance of
monetary policy in West Germany was likely to bring a marked
acceleration of inflation.
    It also warned that what it called the worldwide
synchronization of monetary policy heightened the risk of a new
global recession. It said central banks in industrialized
countries, including the Bundesbank, had followed the Federal
Reserve Board's expansionary course.
    The institute said this in turn was bound to lead
eventually to a rise in worldwide inflation and a shift in U.S.
Policy towards a more restrictive policy. Other central banks
were likely to follow suit, causing a recession that could
aggravate the debt crisis of developing countries as well as
increase protectionism around the world.
    Although Germany cannot entirely shield itself from the
negative effects of the global synchronization of monetary
policy, it should do all it can to strengthen the forces of
growth at home.
    The institute said this could be done by ensuring that
fiscal policy fosters a willingness to work and invest. Taxes
should be cut by a greater amount than currently planned, and
wage increases in 1987 and 1988 should be markedly lower than
in 1986. It also said the Bundesbank should reduce inflationary
pressures by cutting the current rate of growth in money supply
to about four pct.

 ]]></BODY><BODY><![CDATA[Senior officials in the West German
coalition government said tax cuts planned for next year would
be increased by 5.2 billion marks, in line with a pledge made
by Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg at last month's
international monetary conference in Paris.
    Gerold Tandler, General Secretary of the Christian Social
Union Party, detailing the cuts at a news conference also
attended by officials from the Christian Democratic Union and
Free Democratic Party, said all of the additional 5.2 billion
mark reduction would represent net tax relief.
    An increase in revenue from other sources was not planned.
    The reductions will be added on to a package of tax cuts
already planned for 1988 amounting to some nine billion marks.
    Tandler said three billion marks of the extra tax relief
would be accounted for by reducing the rate of marginal
increase in income tax.
    An increase in personal tax allowances would save taxpayers
1.4 billion marks. Extra tax allowances for people whose
children are being educated would cut 300 mln marks from the
tax bill. A further 500 mln marks would be accounted for by
increasing the level of special depreciations for small- and
medium-sized companies.
    The extra fiscal measures planned for next year are part of
a general reform of the tax system which will come into effect
in 1990. Stoltenberg had said in Paris that part of this
reform, which will cut taxes by a gross 44 billion marks, would
be introduced next year, ahead of schedule.
    The West German government had come under pressure from the
United States to stimulate its economy with tax cuts. But
Stoltenberg said in a speech last night in Hamburg that, while
the economy would continue to expand this year, the rate of
growth was uncertain.
    The government said in January it was aiming for real
growth in Gross National Product this year of 2.5 pct, but some
economists have revised their predictions down to two or below.
    Stoltenberg said: "We remain on a course of expansion.
Whether (this will be) under two pct, as some people believe,
or around 2.5 pct as some others expect, or even closer to
three pct, as the Kiel World Economic Institute forecast a few
days ago, remains open at the moment."

peruvian economy said the government's strategy does not offer
good prospects for medium and long-term growth and is likely to
quickly lead to inflation.
    The report, published today by an economic monthly, the
peru report, said the success of president alan garcia's
government in stimulating output last year to achieve eight pct
gross domestic product growth "represents gains in the short
term at the expense of the long."
    Government officials had no immediate comment on the
report, which advised a reduction in the overall size of the
public investment programme and greater emphasis on the
preservation of peru's export potential.
    The report said that although the government had succeeded
in cutting inflation 50 pct a year in the first half of 1985 to
under 70 pct, its stabilisation and reactivation programme was
encountering increasing difficulties.
    "an early renewal of inflationary pressures, linked to
monetary expansion, exchange rate devaluation and an easing of
price controls, appears not improbable," it added.

 ]]></BODY><BODY><![CDATA[European Community finance ministers
discussed the economic outlook for the 12-nation bloc and many
said a recent gloomy forecast by the EC Commission was too
pessimistic.
    The Commission, the EC's executive authority, two weeks ago
cut its forecast for economic growth in the Community to 2.3
per cent for this year from 2.8 per cent predicted last autumn.
    It said economic prospects had been less promising over the
past few months because of a sharp fall in the value of the
dollar and a slowing of world trade -- factors which would
restrain Community exports.
    But diplomats said several member states, led by West
Germany, Britain and France, felt the forecast was too gloomy,
especially since it was drafted before a recent agreement
between the leading Western economic powers to stabilise
currencies around current levels.
    "Many delegations feel the (Commission's) report is rather
too pessimistic," said Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens,
who chaired the meeting.
    The Commission, which slashed its growth forecast for West
Germany to two per cent from 3.2 per cent, has made clear it
feels Bonn has room to introduce additional measures to
stimulate its economy that would benefit the rest of Europe.
    But two top German officials, State Secretaries Otto
Schlecht and Hans Tietmeyer, told reporters Bonn saw no need at
the moment for action to bolster the EC's biggest economy.
    The diplomats said they were backed by Britain and France,
while Italy, Greece and Denmark supported the Commission's view
that Bonn should bring in new measures to aid EC growth.

Japan's battered economy but economists said they do not expect
a vigorous recovery anytime soon. Japanese bank economists
polled by Reuters said the economy's 18 month-old slowdown is
likely to end in the first half of this year, helped by rising
exports, stepped-up government spending and falling prices. "The
economy will bottom out in the middle of the year," said
Sumitomo Bank Ltd chief economist, Masahiko Koido.
    Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd senior economist Susumu
Taketomi agreed. "It (the bottom) is in the offing," he said.
    But he added that the recovery will be slow. Growth in the
fiscal year beginning next month will only pick-up 2.2 pct,
from two pct in the current year, he said.
    Signs that the economy has just about weathered the worst
are increasing.
    The volume of exports in the first two months of the year
rose slightly on a year-on-year basis, after declining toward
the end of last year.
    Although this may be due to extraordinary factors such as a
sharp rise in car exports to rebuild depleted European stocks,
several economists said it could mark the beginning of a
recovery.
    Industrial production fell 0.7 pct in January, much smaller
than expected, and is forecast by the government to rise 0.3
pct in February and 2.6 pct in March. A Bank of Japan survey
released last week showed that the decline in Japanese
corporate earnings may be nearing its end.
    And the Paris currency accord last month has fostered hopes
the rapid yen rise has come to the end, they said.
    Six nations - the U.K., Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And
West Germany - pledged in Paris last month to stabilise
currencies around current levels.
    The yen's 40 pct climb against the dollar over the last two
years has hit the export-driven economy hard, by forcing its
companies to raise prices and lose sales in the U.S. Market.
    "The important thing is the exchange rate," Taketomi said.
    If it stabilises firms will grow more confident and raise
investment in plant and equipment, although there are no signs
of that yet, economists said.
    A stable yen would also help exporters regain some of their
competitive edge just as the U.S economy may be starting to
recover, economists said.
    Domestically, the economy may get a boost from some
loosening of the government's tight fiscal policy said Haruo
Muto, manager of national economics at the Bank of Tokyo Ltd.
    The next reading of the economy's health should come early
next week with the release of gnp figures for the last quarter,
1986.
    Most private economists expect a rise of about 0.5 pct from
the previous quarter. In the third quarter, GNP rose 0.6 pct.
    But a senior government official said the fourth quarter
figures could surprise by showing a rise of more than one point
quarter-on-quarter. But he added that would be a statistical
aberration and not a significant shift in economic activity.
    To maintain year-on-year growth of around 2.5 pct, the
economy would have had to rise about 1.2 pct in the fourth
quarter as the final quarter of 1985 was strong.
     The rise in the fourth quarter of 1985 was probably a
statistical anomaly that was repeated in the final months of
1986, the official said.
    Economists said the fourth quarter figures were also
distorted by the government's sale of gold coins in the second
half of 1986.
    Because the coins were classified as legal tender, their
purchase did not show up in the statistics on consumer
expenditure. Consumer spending also tailed off in December
because of bad weather and smaller-than-normal end-year
bonuses, they said.
    As the government had to buy back some of the coins from
retailers because they were unsold, the government's
contribution to the economy in the fourth quarter may have been
boosted, economists said.
    Taketomi said it may have received a further boost from
government buying of farm products as the domestic crop last
year was good.
    The senior government official said the fourth quarter
performance of the domestic sector was probably worse than
generally expected, while that of the external sector was
better.

for the economy as orders for industry fall and companies scale
back investment plans, the German Savings Banks and Giro
Association said.
    Exporters expect foreign demand to remain weak, while
industry is less optimistic than it was, the association said
in a report.
    However, last month's agreement among the six leading
western industrialized countries to keep currencies around
present levels was expected to be a stabilizing influence for
exporters, it added.
    The banking association said the possibility of using
monetary policy to stimulate the economy should not be
overestimated.
    Another small drop in already low interest rates could not
be expected to cause any significant rise in purchases of
consumer or capital goods, it said.
    The Bundesbank's half-point cuts in the discount and
Lombard rates in January have largely exhausted the scope for
any further monetary moves, the association added.
    On Tuesday the Federal Statistics Office said gross
national product stagnated in real, seasonally and calendar
adjusted terms in the fourth quarter of 1986 compared with the
third quarter.
    The Economics Ministry, commenting on the figures, said GNP
in the 1987 first quarter was also expected to be relatively
weak.
    Bank economists have forecast the economy will either
stagnate or contract slightly in the first quarter. Official
first-quarter figures are due in early June.

disagree on the likelihood the government can meet its budget
deficit reduction targets.
    Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the Council of Economic
Advisers, reiterated the Reagan Administration's opposition to
a tax increase and its pledge to reduce the deficit by cutting
spending and fostering economic growth.
    By contrast, Rudolph Penner, Director of the Congressional
Budget Office, said the budget process has broken down and the
deficit will remain close to 200 billion dlrs for fiscal 1987.
    Sprinkel told a symposium sponsored by New York University
that spending could be cut by avoiding decisions based on the
desire to influence votes and by shifting the responsibility
for local projects to state governments.
    He also suggested a line-item veto, which allows the
President to veto parts of bill without rejecting all of it, to
limit wasteful spending. Spending and taxing decisions should
be linked more closely.
    Sprinkel said the Administration still looks for 2.7 pct
growth in U.S. Real gross national product (GNP) in 1987 and
3.5 pct in 1988.
    Asked if the latest economic reports signal this rate of
economic growth is attainable, Sprinkel said, "It looks pretty
good to me. We've had two very strong employment reports."
    He also said federal reserve policy is appropriate, adding,
"It looks like they're on track."
    While further reductions are needed in the trade deficit,
Sprinkel said the lower dollar is having an impact.
    The new 1987 tax laws will not hurt the economy and the tax
reform act of 1986 significantly lowers tax rates and will
greatly increase private production incentives, he said.
    "Our estimates at the Council of Economic Advisers suggest
national net output of goods and services will permanently
increase by approximately two pct because of the long-run
consequences of tax reform," Sprinkel said. "In 1986, this would
have amounted to an increase of approximately 600 dlrs in the
income of the average American family."
    Sprinkel also argued the 1981 tax cuts were not responsible
for the large increase in the budget deficit.
    In fiscal 1986 ending September, federal spending amounted
to 23.8 pct of GNP, while federal receipts absorbed 18.5 pct of
GNP, leaving a deficit of 5.3 pct, he said.
    Sprinkel said that, compared with fiscal 1978, the 1986
federal expenditure share of GNP is 2.7 percentage points
higher and the revenue share of GNP is virtually the same.
    "Contrary to the conventional wisdom, therefore, the 1981
tax cut is not the root cause of the extraordinary budget
deficits of the past few years," Sprinkel said.
    "This tax cut merely rolled back the inflation-induced tax
increases that occurred between 1978 and 1981," he added.
    However, the Congressional Budget Office's Rudolph Penner
argued that the tax cut in 1981 was misguided.
    "Since making the big mistake in 1981 of cutting taxes
enormously without any plan to decrease spending by the
Administration or Congress, indeed with increases in defence
spending, now all the options (for reducing the budget deficit)
are unpleasant," he said.
    Penner said the tax cut resulted from the ideological
turmoil in the U.S. Caused by the "biggest sustained inflation
in our nation's history," which helped foster widespread
distrust of government.
    "The American people turned on the government with tax
revolt at the state level and new demands on the government at
the national level," Penner said.
    "But their dislike of taxes exceeded their general dislike
of spending programs. Now the correction of that 1981 mistake
demands that the system change a lot."
    Penner sees little hope the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget
deficit reduction targets will be met and said the deficit will
remain at roughly 200 billion dlrs this year.
    He said a budget process that sets targets arbitrarily is
not likely to succeed.
    "I feel pretty safe in saying that any process that tries to
dictate a numerical outcome from above is doomed to fail simply
because there's no ... Way to enforce it," Penner said.
    Penner questioned the methods by which the 1987 budget
deficit was cut. He said 18 to 19 billion dlrs were eliminated
by one-time measures, such as a temporary increase in taxes
related to tax reform and sales of government assets.
    "Another four billion dlrs was cut by what I call creative
timing changes, like moving the military payday from the last
day of fiscal 1987 to the first day of fiscal 1988. That saved
more than two billion dlrs," Penner said.

forecast for the nominal increase in gross national product in
1987 to 3.5 pct from an originally forecast 3.9 pct, Prime

    He said this revision, which brings government forecasts
more closely into line with those by private institutions,
takes account of an anticipated slowdown in the world economy

    But he said the impact on the Belgian economy will be
limited due to recent agreements on wages and working

it had revised its 1987 forecast for this to 0.9 pct from 2.0

    Schroeder-Hohenwarth told a news conference the further
fall of the dollar since the start of this year and the
revaluation of the mark against European currencies meant West
German exporters were facing a "rough wind."
    However, domestic demand was continuing to rise and private
consumption in particular would support the economy, he said.
He saw good prospects for consumer industries.
    Schroeder-Hohenwarth said economic policy now had to
concentrate on strengthening this domestic growth. In this
context, he welcomed a decision by the government to increase
the scope of tax cuts due in 1988.
    He added, a planned reform of the fiscal system scheduled
for 1990, which was worked out by coalition partners this
month, was an "important step in the right direction."
    The government plans to cut corporation tax to 50 pct from
56 pct. However, Schroeder-Hohenwarth said the decision to cut
the maximum rate of income tax to only 53 pct from 56 pct was

Martens announced to Parliament a plan to reduce the 1987
government financing requirement by 20.6 billion francs.
    He said this will enable the requirement to be held to
419.7 billion francs, against the previous government target of
417.8 billion, or eight pct of gross national product.
    Martens said following a lowering of government estimates
of 1987 nominal GNP growth and a re-estimation by government
departments of 1987 spending, the government calculated that
unless action was taken, the requirement would exceed the
target by 22.5 billion francs.
    Martens said the plan involved raising non-fiscal receipts
by 5.8 billion francs and reducing spending by 14.3 billion.
The remaining 0.5 billion francs will be raised through
treasury operations.
    Martens said the money is being found through a series of
small economies and confirmed that it includes the raising of
two billion francs through the sale of part of the government's
50 pct holding in the gas company Distrigaz.
    Last year, the government announced a major program
designed to cut 1987 spending by 195 billion francs.
    The program was designed to get Belgium out of what the
government said was a "snowball effect" under which the
government constantly borrowed more to finance budget deficits
which were due largely to the cost of servicing and repaying
existing debt.
    In 1986, the government financing requirement is estimated
at 561 billion francs or 11.0 pct of GNP.

    Of the 0.5 point contribution of domestic demand to

0.4 point and the public sector, 0.2.
    The private sector contribution included 0.3 point for
housebuilding, 0.4 for corporate capital outlays and 0.1 for
stockbuilding. Consumer spending had a 0.4 negative impact.

increased 0.2 pct in 1986, according to preliminary figures
published by the Central Statistical Office (CSO). This
contrasts with a rise of more than nine pct in 1985.
    The main reason for the slower rate of economic growth was
a drop in the real value of agricultural output. This declined
12 pct in 1986 following a 24 pct improvement the previous
year. Mining output fell one pct in 1986 but manufacturing
production increased 1.4 pct.
    The CSO said that at current prices GDP rose 12.7 pct to
8.2 billion Zimbabwe dlrs, but inflation, measured by the GDP
deflator, was estimated at 12.2 pct, so there was virtually no
growth in real output during 1986.

in the months ahead after turning in its worst performance for
12 years in 1986, private economists said.
    Consumer spending, a main driving force of domestic demand,
was likely to remain lacklustre although brisk housing and
business investment would help sustain the economy this year,
the economists said.
    They said they were shocked by an Economic Planning Agency
report today that private spending fell 0.7 pct in the Oct/Dec
quarter for the first time in 12 years.
    The report said Japan's gross national product rose a real
0.8 pct in Oct/Dec after a revised 0.7 pct increase in the
previous quarter.
    It said GNP growth for 1986 was a real 2.5 pct, down from
4.7 pct in 1985. Agency officials said this was the worst
performance since 1974 when GNP contracted 1.4 pct in the wake
of the first oil crisis.
    They expressed concern about the 0.7 pct decline in
consumer spending in the final quarter of 1986 but said it was
only temporary as exceptionally warm winter weather had
depressed retail sales.
    But most private economists disagreed and said consumers
were likely to remain pessimistic in coming months as they saw
their real income level off.
    "Sure, consumers may have spent less on winter clothes or
heating apparatus because of the warm winter this year, but
they have done so because they have become even more uneasy
about their future pay rises," said Shoji Saito, general manager
of Mitsui Bank's economic research division.
    He said the outlook for pay increases was gloomy because of
 falling employment in many industries, particularly those hit
hard by the yen's rise.
    Masao Suzaki, senior economist at the Bank of Tokyo, said
weakened consumer confidence was the most worrying factor.
Without brisk consumer spending, Japan can hardly achieve
domestically generated economic growth as the government has
put a lid on fiscal measures, he said.
    Other economists said the 0.8 pct growth registered in
Oct/Dec may have been inflated by special factors, including
exceptionally heavy spending in the public sector. Johsen
Takahashi, chief economist at Mitsubishi Research Institute,
said the 14.4 pct increase in public sector spending in Oct/Dec
resulted from an issue of gold coins.
    "This is just a one-shot spending and we can't expect that
high level of public-sector consumption in the following
quarter," Takahashi said. Agency officials said public spending
would have risen 1.1 pct in Oct/Dec without the issue, which
marked 60 years of Emperor Hirohito's reign.
    Takahashi said the economy might contract in the current
quarter given the lack of additional significant government
spending and sluggish consumer spending.
    Saito said the most effective government action would be
income tax cuts and the postponement beyond next January of a
proposed controversial sales tax.

Lawson, presenting his budget for fiscal 1987/88 to Parliament,
said U.K. Economic growth was forecast at three pct in calendar
1987.
    He said the Treasury expected a current account balance of
payments deficit in 1987 of 2.5 billion stg, after a 1.1
billion shortfall in 1986.
    Inflation is expected to be 4.0 pct at the end of this
year, Lawson said.
    "As I forecast in the Autumn Statement, inflation may
continue to edge up for a time, perhaps exceeding 4.5 pct by
the summer, before falling back to 4.0 pct by the end of the
year," he added.
    Turning to the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR),
Lawson said the likely outturn for fiscal 1986/87 was 4.0
billion stg, or 1.0 pct of GDP.
    The planned PSBR for 1987/88 was set at 4.0 billion stg.
    On monetary policy, Lawson confirmed the target range for
the narrow M0 measure would be two to six pct in fiscal
1987/88.
    No explicit target was set for the broad sterling M3
aggregate, he said. "But broad money will continue to be taken
into account in assessing monetary conditions, as of course
will the exchange rate," the Chancellor told Parliament.
    Lawson said the low outturn of the PSBR in 1986/87 "is
chiefly attributable to the remarkable buoyancy of non-oil tax
revenues in general, and the corporation tax paid by an
increasingly profitable business sector in particular."
    On oil prices, Lawson said he was sticking to his earlier
assumption that North Sea crude prices will average 15 dlrs per
barrel in calendar 1987.
    He said "it is clear that the increased flow of non-oil tax
revenues, coupled with the prospective further growth of the
economy in excess of the growth of public expenditure, puts the
public finances in a very strong position."
    Lawson said the Treasury would strive to keep the PSBR at
1.0 pct of GDP in future.
    "We have reached what I judge to be the (Medium Term
Financial Strategy's) appropriate destination - a PSBR of 1.0
pct of GDP. My aim will be to keep it there over the years
ahead," Lawson said.
    "Inevitably, this greatly diminishes the scope I have this
year for reducing the burden of taxation, which of course
remains a major objective of government policy."
    "But I am sure it is right to err on the side of prudence
and caution, and to build a still firmer base for the future."
    Lawson said the time had come to strike the Exchange
Control Act from the Statute book.
    On corporation tax, he said the rate will remain unchanged
at 35 pct in 1987/88. But companies' capital gains will be
charged at the "appropriate corporation tax rate."
    He said that under the new proposed system, companies
should be able to set Advanced Capital Tax (ACT) payments
against tax on capital gains.
    "Taken together, these changes should yield 60 mln stg in
1988/89," Lawson said.
    Lawson said he will propose that all companies and building
societies be treated the same way on payment of corporation
tax, "with all liable to pay corporation tax nine months after
the end of the accounting period on which the tax is due."
    "I also propose to legislate now to pave the way for a new
method of collecting corporation tax, to be known as Pay and
File."
    This would be part of a wider programme of streamlining tax
collection, and would not come into force until the early
1990s.
    Lawson said he planned two reliefs on Petroleum Revenue Tax
(PRT). As from today, companies may elect to have up to 10 pct
of the costs of developing certain new fields set against their
(PRT) liabilities in existing fields, until the income of those
new fields exceeds the costs incurred.
    Second, there will be a new relief against PRT for spending
on research into U.K. Oil extraction that is not related to any
particular field.
    On business employment, Lawson said employers will receive
tax relief for retraining workers.
    Lawson said that in future, traders registered for Value
Added Tax (VAT) would be able to choose to account for the tax
on the basis of cash paid and received.
    Small businesses may account for VAT annually instead of
quarterly. The VAT compulsory registration period was being
extended to 30 days, he added, and VAT registration thresholds
are to be raised to 21,300 stg.
    New measures are planned to combat VAT avoidance, he added.
    The capital gains tax retirement relief limit would now be
set at 125,000 stg.
    Lawson said he proposed to change the law so that companies
in multinational groups with dual residence will no longer be
able to secure tax relief twice on the same interest payment.
The change will take effect on April 1, 1987, but "genuine
trading companies" will not be affected.
    He also planned to end the present treatment of tax credit
relief for foreign withholding tax paid on interest on bank
loans, also from April 1.
    "In future, banks will be able to offset this tax credit
only against tax on the profit on the relevant loan," he said.
    The standard rate of taxation is being reduced by two
pence, to 27 pct from 29 pct.
    Lawson reiterated the government's aim of reducing basic
taxation to 25 pence in the pound, but added "given my decision
to use the greater part of the fiscal scope I now have to
reduce the PSBR, that goal cannot be achieved in this budget."
    Small companies' corporation tax is also being reduced to
27 pct, he said.
    On the Lloyd's insurance market, Lawson said he planned to
change the tax treatment of Lloyd's syndicates, bringing it
into line with that of provisions for outstanding liabilities
made by ordinary insurance companies and of comparable
provisions made by financial traders.
    The Inland Revenue would be told to consult urgently with
Lloyd's about the details of the legislation, he said.
    "The new rules will first apply to premiums payable for the
Lloyd's account which closes on December 31 this year," Lawson
said.

consumption or relying on a systematic budget deficit or other
reflationary policies to boost the French economy, sources
close to finance minister Edouard Balladur said.
    Their comments followed remarks by prime minister Jacques
Chirac's spokesman Denis Baudouin, who said on Monday ministers
were agreed on the desirability of "relaunching" the economy.
    This sparked speculation the government was preparing for a
reflationary U-turn, but the finance ministry immediately ruled
out any such move.
    The sources today said the government's policy remained one
of "recovery," or sound finances and greater efficiency.
    They said that while 8.6 billion of the 30 billion franc
revenues expected for 1987 from a sweeping privatisation
program will go to providing public companies with fresh
capital, 21.4 billion francs, or two-thirds, will go toward
paying off national debt.
    Any further privatisation revenue this year above the 30
billion would be distributed between repayment of national
internal debt and public companies in similar proportions, they
added.
    The sources said it was absurd to talk of reflation when
the country's internal debt, expected to grow by 10 pct this
year from 1,300 billion francs in 1986 was growing twice as
fast as gross domestic product.
    Nominal GDP is expected to grow by roughly five pct this
year from 5,000 billion francs last year, broadly in line with
earlier forecasts. Real GDP will grow by up to 2.5 pct.
    The sources said that with France's economic targets for
1987 roughly in line with its main trading partners, the
government had no intention of pushing the economy to grow at
an artificial pace out of step with neighbouring economies.

    However, it expects growth to recover next year to the 1986
level of two pct.
    IPECODE said demand and production would develop in
parallel this year, in contrast to last year when production
was unable to keep pace with the strong rise in domestic
demand, unleashing higher import demand.
    Claims on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) rose by 298
mln francs to 19.61 billion francs, due to net withdrawals in
francs by member nations, and an increase in reserves of
Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) due mainly to the repayment of
French debts.
    Its deficit with the European Monetary Cooperation Fund
(FECOM) remained unchanged in February at 33.90 billion francs.
    French household consumption, which rose by 3.1 pct last
year, is likely to grow by just 1.1 pct this year and 1.5 pct
in 1988, it added.
    Industrial investment is expected to rise by 4.3 pct this
year and 5.5 pct in 1988, down from 6.5 pct in 1986.

    Bank Negara also said in its annual report that gross
national product (GNP) is expected to grow by 3.5 to four pct,
after declining 7.3 pct in 1986.
    It said that a turnaround in investor confidence since last
November had been spurred by a moderate improvement in oil and
commodity prices and a rise in manufacturing exports.
    Growth in 1987 is expected to come from the anticipated
rise in export earnings if the industrialised countries sustain
their average GNP growth at 2.5 to three pct, it added.
    Bank Negara said its forecast assumes that crude oil will
average 15.50 dlrs a barrel, rubber at 210 cents a kilo, palm

of 12 pct in manufacturing exports.

Significant declines were recorded in the output of automobiles

(WIFO) said it has cut its forecast for Austria's 1987 gross
domestic product growth to a real one pct from a two pct
forecast made last December.
    WIFO chief Helmut Kramer told a new conference that he saw
the one pct figure, which compares with 1.8 pct last year, as
the upper limit of growth. The institute had made the revision
due to poor prospects for Austrian exports, he added.
    A collapse in sales to the Eastern European and oil
producing states, combined with the effects of the dollar's
fall, mean exports overall are unlikely to rise this year.
    Kramer said domestic demand alone would fuel growth this
year. After last year's 2.8 pct rise in real incomes, private
consumption was likely to rise 2.25 pct in 1987 after 1.9 pct
in 1986, despite a present trend towards higher savings.
    Unemployment was likely to rise to almost six pct from 5.2
pct last year due to the slack economic activity.
    Kramer said the current account was likely to run a deficit
of about four billion schillings compared with a 2.6 billion
surplus recorded last year. The National Bank, Austria's
central bank, last month forecast the current account would be
roughly in balance this year.
    However, Kramer said the lower economic growth should have
no notable effect on the government's attempts to cut the
budget deficit. This year's aim of reducing the deficit to 4.9
pct of GDP from 5.1 pct in 1986 could still be achieved, he
said.

adjustment to reduce debt and improve its economic performance,
the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said
in its latest annual review of the Australian economy.
    It said Australia had a current external deficit of 5-3/4
pct of gross domestic product, high and rapidly rising external
debt equal to 30 pct of GDP, growing servicing costs and
inflation above nine pct, far higher than that of other OECD
countries.
    A major policy change in early 1985 helped lay the basis
for sustained non-inflationary growth and external
competitiveness had improved, but economic performance overall
had sharply deteriorated since June 1985.
    A major shift of real resources to the external sector --
about 4-1/2 pct of GDP by 1990-91 -- was required for the
economy to expand in line with potential, for employment to
grow, and for the debt/GDP ratio to stabilize, it said.
    Success depended on the setting of right policies including
tighter fiscal policy, a reduction in the public sector
borrowing requirement and on private sector behaviour.
    Looking ahead over the next 18 months, the OECD expected
economic performance to improve, partly as a result of tighter
fiscal and monetary policy, and a substantial improvement in
trade volumes.
    It said positive GDP growth of three pct might be restored,
the current external deficit could fall to some 4-1/2 pct of
GDP by the first half of next year, while inflation was
projected to decelerate to around five to 5-1/2 pct by
mid-1988.
    Continued real wage moderation was essential to maintain
the competitive edge created by the Australian dollar's
depreciation, and to maintain if not boost profit shares in
order to encourage business investment.
    The report urged Australia to broaden its export base by
developing viable and competitive service and manufacturing
industries, and not count on a recovery of commodity markets to
correct its external imbalances.
    It added Australia should reduce protection levels in
manufacturing, even though faster trade liberalisation would no
doubt hurt the most protected sectors of industry.

    The Keidanren meeting coincided with a written request for

economic targets for 1987 after studying the performance of the
economy in the first quarter, the economy ministry said in its
monthly bulletin.
    Internal demand is now forecast to rise four pct against a
previous target of 3.5 pct.
    Mariano Rubio, governor of the Bank of Spain, the central
bank, yesterday said internal demand was currently growing at
an annual rate of six pct and it had to be brought down to four
pct if the government were to meet its five pct inflation
target this year. Inflation was 8.3 pct in 1986.
    The forecast for private consumption growth remains
unchanged at three pct, although public consumption is revised
upwards to 2.5 pct from 2.0 pct.
    Growth in domestic demand will fuel imports, expected to
increase by 8.6 pct against an originally estimated 7.1 pct.
    Export growth has been revised downwards to 3.7 pct from
5.2 pct due to the peseta's continuing strength against the
dollar and slack external demand.
    Slow growth of exports and a tight rein on state spending
has lowered estimated GDP growth to three pct in 1987 from an
earlier forecast 3.5 pct. GDP grew by three pct last year.
    The economy ministry is holding its inflation forecast to
five pct, in spite of minister Carlos Solchaga's doubts last

faster rate than in February, with the National Association of
Purchasing Management's composite index rising to 53.9 pct from
51.9 pct, the NAPM said.
    The first quarter average for the index also was 53.9 pct.
The NAPM said that, if this average were to continue for the
rest of 1987, it would be consistent with real gross national
product growth of about three pct.
    An index reading above 50 pct generally indicates that the
economy is in an expanding phase. One below 50 pct implies a
declining economy.
    The NAPM said the economic improvement was evident in all
of the indicators in the index except inventories, which
declined slightly.
    New orders rose sharply in March, with production also
higher. Vendor deliveries slowed, another sign that the economy
improved in March. Employment expanded for the first time since
August 1984.
    Robert Bretz, chairman of the NAPM's business survey
committee and director of materials management at Pitney Bowes
Inc <PBI> said "the economy ended the first quarter with a
healthy, if not substantial improvement."
    Bretz said the sharp rise in the growth of new orders in
March assures a good beginning for the second quarter.
    Some 50 pct of the purchasing managers reported that they
were paying higher prices in March than at the end of 1986. Of
those paying higher prices now, the average increase was put at
2.5 pct.
    The estimated average price increase anticipated by members
for the remainder of 1987 is 2.1 pct. While prices continue to
rise, the NAPM said that most purchasers do not see them as
being significant.
    The composite index is a seasonally adjusted figure, based
on five components of the NAPM business survey - new orders,
production, vendor deliveries, inventories and employment.
    The monthly report is based on questions asked of
purchasing managers at 250 U.S. industrial companies.

weaken this year, adding new worries to an already serious
poverty outlook, economic analysts said.
    For finance ministers and central bankers attending this
week's semi-annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund
and World Bank, the new figures released by the IMF add an
additional concern.
    The Fund estimated world output would only grow by 2.7 pct
this year, versus 2.9 pct last year, and 3.1 pct in 1985.
    In the industrial countries, Gross National Product, a
measure of all goods and services, was expected to decline to
2.3 pct this year, compared with 2.4 pct in 1986, the IMF said.
    For the developing countries, the Gross Domestic Product,
another measure of economic growth, was expected to fall to 3.0
pct from 3.5 pct last year.
    The new figures are considered a major disappointment to
the poorest countries. They had hoped that new vitality in the
industrial countries brought on by a sharp decline in oil
prices would assist their economic recovery and help them cope
with growing mounds of debt.
    IMF officials, discussing their outlook, said they believed
the industrial country economies would move up to an annual
growth rate of three pct by the end of the decade.
    Economic analysts and the IMF have been saying for some
time that the ability to keep the debt crisis from turning into
an economic rout rests on sustained economic growth.
    Since the debtor countries must look to the wealthier
states for markets for their products as well as financial
assistance, economic weakness in the developed nations' 
economies poses fundamental worries.
    Debtor countries, including the very poorest states, have
only a few avenues open to them for earning foreign exchange,
including the key one of exports.
    The U.S. economy, which is in its fifth year of expansion,
has served as a mainstay for developing country exports, but it
too is seen as being rather feeble this year, growing by only
2.3 pct, according to the IMF.
    For this reason and because of a high trade deficit, the
United States has been pressuring Japan and West Germany to
ignite their economies but with little apparent success.
    The IMF study also examines the course of the dollar and
the curious lack of impact it has had on the U.S. trade
deficit.
    Reagan administration officials have been saying that the
impact is now beginning to show up, although it has been much
slower than expected.
    The IMF observed in its World Economic Outlook that "it has
to be recognized that exchange rate adjustments take time to
work through to payments flows -- probably at least three years
to get a resonably complete effect."
    The report added, however, "the adjustments may take even
more time on this occasion."

 ]]></BODY><BODY><![CDATA[The five leading West German economic
research institutes said the government should do more to
stimulate economic growth and called for early introduction of
tax cuts planned for 1990.
    In their joint spring report the institutes were divided
about 1987 growth forecasts, with three predicting two pct
expansion and the other two only one pct growth. Gross national
product grew 2.4 pct last year.
    But the report said all the institutes believed that "more
must be done to produce dynamic growth so that more additional
jobs can be created."
    The institutes said any step which improved basic economic
conditions should be taken as quickly as possible. "From this
point of view, the tax reform planned for 1990 should be
brought forward."
    The government plans gross tax reductions of 44 billion
marks as part of the major tax reform. The net tax relief from
the tax reform will amount to 25 billion marks.
    However, the institutes criticised the government, not only
for the timing of the reform, but also because the question of
its financing had been left open.
    The government has not specified how the remaining 19
billion marks of the tax reduction package will be paid for,
though it has said it wants to cut state subsidies.
    The institutes said this lack of clarity from Bonn had
caused uncertainty among companies and households as to what
exactly they would receive from the tax reform and urged a
quick decision from the government.
    They also said the government should reduce tax
preferences, which would simplify the fiscal system, urged a
restriction of state spending and called for no increase in
value-added tax.
    The institutes also criticised Bonn for increasing
subsidies at a time further reductions had been pledged.
    They referred specifically to a doubling of special
writedowns for small and medium sized companies announced in a
package of tax adjustments planned for 1988 and described this
as an increase in subsidies.
    The institutes said total subsidies, including tax
preferences, had reached 80 billion marks in 1985 and risen
further since then. Given the scope of these subsidies, it
should be possible "despite ... Major political difficulties" to
finance the tax reform by cutting state handouts.
    The institutes said that if the government raised value
added tax or other indirect taxes a large portion of the
positive effects resulting from lower taxes would be lost.
    The report also noted that the government was progressing
only slowly with its plans to privatise state companies and
said more deregulation was needed. The government had to aim
for more competition, it said.

Community (EC) free of damaging budget wrangles receive their
first full review from EC foreign ministers today, but are
unlikely to gather much support.
    Diplomats said key EC capitals would voice strong criticism
of proposals that would lead to a sharp increase in EC budget
payments by bringing member states" contributions more into line
with national wealth.
    They said the EC"s current paymasters, Britain, France, and
West Germany, would lead the opposition to the plans, designed
to enable the community meet the challenges of the 1990s.
    Faced with a budget deficit this year of at least five
billion dlrs, EC Commission President Jacques Delors called in
February for a radical overhaul of the EC financing system.
    Such action was necessary, he argued, to end a damaging
cycle of annual budget crises and ensure cash for technological
research programs and regional and social spending projects.
    Ironically, diplomats said, the move could spark exactly
the type of row it was intended to avoid with industrially
developed northern states demanding assurances the new cash
would not be swallowed up by the poorer southern members.
    Delors" plans, by linking a country"s contributions to its
Gross National Product (GNP), would over the next five years
add some 18 billion dlrs to the present budget of 34 billion.
    Currently, contributions are calculated on a percentage of
Value Added Tax (VAT) returns.
    Under the new scheme, all countries would pay one pct of
their VAT receipts to Brussels. Extra cash would then be raised
in line with needs by a levy on the difference between a
country"s total VAT receipts and its GNP.
    London is one of the most resolutely opposed countries to
the scheme, arguing instead that money should be made available
from deep cutbacks in the EC"s heavily-subsidised farm sector.
    Unofficially many EC capitals secretly support the
wearisome budget wrangling, taking the line that the highly
diverse 12-nation Community can only take tough decisions when
forced to do so.
    The issue is further complicated by a possible general
election in Britain and acceptance that the EC problems cannot
seriously be addressed by London until those polls are out of
the way.

make the economy's growth rate in 1987 its slowest in a decade,
Sri Lankan finance minister Ronnie de Mel said here.
    He told Reuters in an interview that he expected gross
domestic product to expand by only four pct in 1987. He said it
averaged five pct over the past three years.
    For the first two years after the present troubles began in
1983, production of key commodities like tea, rubber, coconuts
and rice kept up, he said.
    Tamils on the island are fighting for a seperate state.
    De Mel said: "Private sector production in fact grew by 25
pct in 1984 and 20 pct in 1985. But last year things took a
turn for the worse."
    He said prices of tea, the main export, fell to half their
1984 levels. World prices of rubber and copra also fell.
    "There was also a decline in income from tourism and
remittances from Sri Lankans working in the Middle East."
    He said any savings from the worldwide drop in crude oil
prices were wiped out by the cut in commodity earnings.
    "To add to all this we have had, between January and March
this year, the worst drought I have seen in my life," he said.
    De Mel said the drought would seriously affect agricultural
production.
    He said because of the fighting in the country, defence
expenditure was now about 20 pct of the national 1987 budget of
70 billion rupees.
    Sri Lanka planned to borrow about 600 mln dlrs in 1987 from
the World Bank and the Sri Lanka Aid Consortium which comprises
members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD), he said.
    "We also plan to ask the International Monetary Fund for
another 200 mln dlrs through a structural adjustment facility
and a compensatory financing facility to balance our export
revenue cuts," de Mel said.
    He said despite the unrest, Sri Lanka had succeeded in
keeping its total foreign debt to three billion dlrs by
avoiding borrowing from commercial banks.
    "Commercial bank debt accounts for only 15 pct of our total
foreign debt," he said.
    He said the Mahaweli hydro-electric project was nearing
completion. It was likely to cut dependence on oil imports.
    "The project will more than treble our hydro-electric power
from 300 megawatts to nearly 1,000 megawatts," de Mel said.
    He said 20 new townships would rise around the project,
which is in the north-central part of the island. It was
expected to irrigate 1.2 mln acres of land and indirectly
provide employment for 500,000 landless families.

figures released yesterday indicated the government was likely
to achieve its 1987 targets, Central Bank governor Jose
Fernandez said in an interview.
    The National Economic Development Authority (NEDA)
announced yesterday gross domestic product (GDP) grew 5.78 pct
and gross national product (GNP) 5.53 pct in the first quarter
from a year earlier.
    "I don't see anything on the horizon that should cut it
(growth) short," Fernandez said.
     NEDA said GNP had grown 3.56 pct and GDP 3.25 pct in the
fourth quarter of 1986 from a year earlier. Last year's GNP
growth, put earlier at 0.13 pct, was revised to 1.51 pct.
    "Certainly I do not see any shortage in external resources
and if GNP growth continues at this level I would assume that
domestic resources on the fiscal side would be generated and
would not be a stumbling block," Fernandez said.
    "I think even before the figures came out, simply looking at
key indicators, such as consumption of fuel oil and power,
showed that the economy was on a different track from last
year," he said.
    Fernandez said consumption tended to be heavier in the
first and second quarters because of the dry weather, and it
could drop off in the third quarter.
    He said the most significant sign of recovery lay in the
manufacturing sector, which grew by 9.64 pct, after declines in
1985 and a slow turnaround in the second half of 1986.
    "That is not a seasonal thing, it is secular," he said.
    He said the government had met all monetary targets set for
the first quarter in consultation with the International
Monetary Fund (IMF). It expected to draw down the fourth
tranche from its 198 mln SDR stand-by arrangement soon.
    The Philippines has so far drawn three tranches totalling
58 mln SDRs from the arrangement expiring on April 23, 1988.
Fernandez said an IMF mission would visit here in July or
August to review performance in the January-June period.
    He said IMF repayments were projected to total 1.56 billion
dlrs over the 1987-92 period and drawings only 236 mln dlrs.
Repayments were inevitable and many countries would find their
net repayments to the IMF rising in the next few years.
    "It means that since there will be a net drain on ODA
(official development assistance) accounts the commercial
banking system will be requested to hold the line," he said.
    It is an internal constraint that exists because the IMF
debt cannot be rescheduled, Fernandez said.
    The Philippines rescheduled 10.3 billion dlrs of its 28
billion dlr foreign commercial debt in March.
    Fernandez said Central Bank bills, introduced in March 1984
to mop up excess liquidity, had peaked at 43.1 billion pesos in
April 1986. But their unwinding on maturity dates, started in
October last year, had almost been completed.
    He said auctions of treasury bills, whose outstanding level
touched 95.44 billion pesos on May 20, were going well.
"Treasury bills will remain a basic monetary tool," he said.
    Commenting on the country's foreign debt Fernandez said, "I
think the Philippine debt stock looms large because our own
receipts from exports have not taken the same kind of leap
forward as might have been suitable."
    The foreign debt is projected by the Central Bank to reach
29.04 billion dlrs by the end of 1987.
    NEDA said exports totalled 1.2 billion dlrs in the first
quarter, while imports were 1.4 billion dlrs.
    Fernandez said the government had targeted GNP growth of
between six and 6.5 pct this year. He cautioned that while
growth so far was high the targets had not yet been achieved.
    Fernandez said he saw no merit in arguments by some
economists that the peso, currently pegged at 20.50 to the
dollar, ought to be devalued to make the country's exports more
competitive.
    "By being pegged to the dollar on a basket basis the peso
has already substantially devalued against all of the country's
trading partners," he said.
    On the proposed Omnibus Investment Code, he said he was
opposed to a clause which would allow the unrestricted
repatriation abroad of investments made during the first two
years after the imposition of the Code.
    The imposition of the Code, scheduled for last January, has
been delayed by objections from some business groups.
    "I think any central bank, certainly this one after the
events of the past two or two and a half years, has to be
prudent. This is not the time to throw all caution to the winds
and I'm not about to do that," Fernandez said.
    "It would be ideal if we reach a point where movement of
capital and earnings can be free," he said.
    "We have had one year of reasonably good results. Certainly
we continue to have a fairly heavy drain on our external
availabilities simply by servicing our debts."

German GNP will be published on June 11 after they were
provisionally scheduled for June 4, an official at the Federal
Statistics Office said.
    The official said there had been a delay in gathering
information for the data, which are expected to show that the
West German economy contracted in the period.
    A spokesman for the Economics Ministry in Bonn said there
was no political motivation behind publishing the figures on
June 11, the day after the Venice economic summit ends.
    "There is no political motivation. It is a purely technical
matter," he added.
    The West German government is expected to come under
pressure in Venice from both the U.S. And its European partners
to stimulate domestic demand as a way of reducing international
trade imbalances and contributing to world economic growth.
    However, government officials have ruled out any further
tax reduction packages to supplement a major program of
stimulatory fiscal measures already underway.
    Helmut Schlesinger, vice-president of the West German
central bank, the Bundesbank, said in Tokyo today that GNP, the
widest measure of a country's economic activity, fell in real
terms by a seasonally adjusted 1/2 to one pct in the first
quarter compared with the fourth 1986 period.
     The government has confirmed that growth was negative in
the first 1987 quarter. But year-on-year growth is expected to
be about two pct.
    Schlesinger today repeated the Bundesbank's reluctance to
cut its official interest rates further. Its key discount rate,
at three pct, is just above historical lows.
    West German officials are likely to emphasise at the Venice
summit that domestic demand, which draws in goods from abroad,
is already outstripping export performance, which has suffered
from an 80 pct rise of the mark against the dollar in just over
two years.
    The government has pointed out that depressed exports are
the main reason for the current weakness in the economy, but
says that later in the year stronger domestic demand will
compensate for this setback.
    It expects GNP growth for the whole of 1987 of just under
two pct, after a 2.4 pct rise in 1986.

its recent outstanding performance during the financial year
1986/87 ending on June 30 but areas like balance of payments,
investments and energy were causing concern.
    GDP grew in line with the average growth rate since 1980
and the inflation rate was the lowest since 1969/70, according
to a government economic survey.
     The reform of economic regulation had gathered momentum
and there was an impressive performance in a five point
government program for rural uplift, education and poverty
alleviation, said the survey.
    Ministry Economic Adviser Qazi Alimullah told a news
conference that before recent unseasonal rains and hailstorms
damaged the wheat crop, GDP growth was calculated at 7.04 pct
compared to 7.25 pct in 1985/86.He said the figure might now
slide down a little to around 6.8 or 6.9 pct.
    The survey said monetary expansion was estimated to be nine
pct to date but might rise to around 12 pct by the year-end.
    Alimullah said exports rose 18 pct to 3.5 billion dlrs from
2.9 billion dlrs in 1985/86. But the at the same time, home
remittances by Pakistanis abroad dropped to 2.3 billion dlrs
from the 1985/86 level of 2.595 billion.
    More exports and an improvement in the balance of payments
situation will be required to overcome this declining trend in
home remittances, he said.
    The survey said the trade deficit was expected to fall to
2.4 billion dlrs from three billion dlrs in 1985/86 because of
the boost in exports.
    He said national investment continued to be small because
of a poor rate of savings, about 14 pct of GDP. He said more
savings were required to maintain or possibly step up the
present growth rate and to finance the country's seventh
five-year development plan to be launched in July 1988.

council of economic experts believes a further stimulation of
the economy is inappropriate, government spokesman Friedhelm
Ost said.
    A statement released by Ost after a meeting of Chancellor
Helmut Kohl and senior government officials with the council
said the experts believed 1987 ecomomic growth of 1-1/2 to two
pct was achievable.
    It added the council believed "an intensification of the
already expansionary stimulation of monetary and financial
policy is not called for."
    Ost's statement said experts believed further pressure on
West Germany to adapt to external economic factors would not
increase.
    The government regularly uses the term "changed external
economic factors" when referring to the fall of the dollar,
which has severely damaged West German exports. Bonn officials
have said they expect exports to pick up during the year, but
could still fall below the 1986 level.
    Along with other leading industrial countries, West Germany
agreed to a package of measures at a meeting in Paris in
February aimed at stemming the fall of the dollar.
    The stance taken by the experts backs up the official
position of the West German government ahead of next week's
seven nation summit in Venice, where Bonn is expected to be
pressed by the U.S. And other partners to boost its economy.
    West German government officials have stressed Bonn is not
in a position to stimulate growth further since tax cuts due
next year and 1990 are already stretching the budget.
    The Bundesbank has also ruled out a quick cut in official
interest rates although it sees market rates continuing low.
    The experts' prediction for economic growth this year of
between 1-1/2 and two pct is a slight downward revision from a
forecast made last November when two pct growth was forecast.
    Many independent forecasters have revised down 1987
predictions in light of the downturn in exports. The government
itself has said it expects growth of just under two pct,
compared with a 2.4 pct expansion in 1986.

a real 1.2 pct in the January/March quarter after a downwardly
revised 0.7 pct increase in the previous three months, the
Economic Planning Agency said.
    The October/December rise was originally put at 0.8 pct.
    For the fiscal year ended last March 31, gnp rose 2.6 pct,
after a 4.3 pct increase in 1985/86. Last year's performance
was the worst since 1974/75, when gnp contracted by 0.4 pct,
and was below the government's revised three pct forecast.
    Economists said the strong yen was largely to blame for the
slowdown in economic growth in 1986/87.
    Domestic demand increased 0.7 pct in the January/March
quarter and 4.3 pct in the fiscal year, compared with growth of
0.6 pct in October/December and 3.7 pct in 1985/86.
    The annualized growth rate in the January/March quarter
accelerated to 4.9 pct, from 2.9 pct in October/December.
    In nominal terms, gnp rose 0.7 pct in January/March, after
a 0.5 pct October/December rise, reflecting lower prices.
    Domestic demand contributed 0.7 percentage point to real
gnp growth in January/March, while foreign trade added 0.5
point. In October/December domestic demand contributed 0.6
point, while foreign trade added 0.2 point.
    Of the 0.5 point contribution of foreign trade to gnp last
quarter, rising exports accounted for 0.3 point and falling
imports contributed 0.2.
    Total export volume rose 2.0 pct quarter-on-quarter in
January/March, while imports fell 1.2 pct.
    Of the 0.7 point contribution of domestic demand to
January/March gnp growth, the private sector accounted for 1.1
point while the public sector knocked off 0.4.
    The private sector contribution included 0.4 point for
corporate capital outlays and 1.0 for consumer spending, while
destocking subtracted 0.3 point.
    In 1986/87, domestic demand contributed 4.1 percentage
points to growth while foreign trade knocked off 1.5 points.
    In 1985/86, the domestic demand contribution was 3.6 points
and foreign trade 0.7 point.

over for the Japanese economy, after today's news of stronger
than expected growth in the January/March period.
    But private economists were not so sure and said the
economy was unlikely to achieve the government's 3.5 pct growth
forecast in the current fiscal year ending next March.
    As already reported, GNP rose 1.2 pct in the January/March
quarter, after a revised 0.7 pct increase in the previous three
months. For the fiscal year that ended last March 31, GNP
growth slowed to 2.6 pct from 4.3 pct in 1985/86.
    The government economists acknowledged that the improved
export performance in the January/March quarter was unlikely to
be repeated. The volume of exports during the period was up two
pct from the previous three months.
    The yen's rise in April to about 140 to the dollar from 150
probably resulted in a fall in exports in the April/June
quarter, they said.
    However, given the yen's recent stability, stepped-up
domestic demand should work as a driving force to push the
economy onto a path of sustainable growth, they said.
    Many private economists, though, doubt that the economy
will achieve the government's 3.5 pct growth forecast for the
1987/88 year.
    Growth in 1986/87 also fell short of the government's
forecast, which was revised downwards to three pct last
December from an original four pct.
    Domestic demand as a whole is not strong enough, except for
housing, said Johsen Takahashi, chief economist at Mitsubishi
Research Institute.
    Consumer spending is likely to remain weak as the growth in
nominal income stays low, he added.
     The rise in consumer spending in the January-March quarter
was simply a reflection of the contraction that occurred in the
preceding three months, Takahashi said.
    Private capital spending in the quarter looked strong but
this was primarily because utility companies brought forward
their 1987/88 capital investment plans into the final quarter
of 1986/87 in line with the government's economic stimulation
package announced last fall, he said.
    Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank chief economist Kosaku Furuta said he
was unable to say the economy has bottomed out, but added he
expects increasing signs of recovery in the coming months.
    Destocking is coming to an end and companies are starting
to rebuild inventories, Furuta said.
    Housing is expected to remain buoyant, backed up by lower
interest rates as well as government policies to stimulate the
sector, he said. The government's recently unveiled 6,000
billion yen economic package will also help the economy.
    But he said that the economy was unlikely to achieve the
government's 3.5 pct forecast for 1987/88, although growth
might come close to three pct.

will exceed 10 pct real growth this year and the won will rise
further as long as the current account surplus continues to
widen, Deputy Prime Minister Chun In-Yong told reporters.
    Chung, who is also Minister of Economic Planning, said his
GNP estimate was based on the assumption that the economy will
remain stable.
    The official target for 1987 GNP growth is eight pct.
    GNP rose 15.6 pct between the first quarters of 1987 and
1986, according to provisional Bank of Korea figures.
    GNP rose 12.5 pct in calendar 1986.
    In the first four months of this year, the current account
swung to a surplus of 2.5 billion dlrs from a deficit of 294
mln dlrs in the same 1986 period.
    "What the Minister said does not imply any major economic
policy change," a Ministry spokesman told Reuters. "But he tried
to urge business circles to prepare for the forseeable economic
(future) ... A high won era."
    South Korean manufacturers, who have insisted the won
should not rise more than seven pct this year, have said they
plan to ask the government to slow down its appreciation
against the dollar.
    The Bank of Korea today quoted the won unchanged at 812.05
against the dollar, a 6.02 pct gain so far this year compared
with a 3.34 pct increase for the whole of 1986.

feature of the economies of southern European countries in
1986, though the growth is seen slowing this year and next, the
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said.
    In its semi-annual report, the OECD said Portugal's total
domestic demand growth would decline from 7.6 pct last year to
five pct in 1987 and 3.75 pct in 1988 as slower wage growth
restrained private consumption.
    Turkey's economy grew much faster than expected in 1986 and
domestic demand surged 10.5 pct, but this growth was expected
to be halved to five pct next year.
    In Spain, buoyant domestic demand, led by fixed investment,
had been the driving force behind rapid growth in Gross
Domestic Product. Both fixed investment and private consumption
were expected to ease during 1988 but would still remain
strong.
    The OECD forecast that Spanish imports would rise sharply
next year, reflecting strong demand, entry to the European
Community and declining competitiveness.
    In Greece, inflation was forecast to turn downwards
following an increase early this year linked with the
introduction of Value Added Tax and a surge in food prices due
to cold weather.

threaten to cut exports and reduce the international
competitiveness of their industries, the Organisation for

    In Denmark, the OECD said wage settlements concluded in

in competitiveness. Sweden's competitive position was also seen
at risk from accelerating wages.
    The OECD predicted that domestic demand would come under
pressure from tight fiscal policy in Denmark, as well as
Norway, Sweden and Finland.
    Overall economic growth will vary in the different
countries between 1986 and 1988, the OECD semi-annual report
said.
    After a strong rise of 7.8 pct in 1986, total domestic
demand in Norway was seen falling by 1.5 pct in 1987 and one
pct the following year. Denmark was also expected to see a
slump in domestic demand. The report said growth in Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) was likely to speed up slightly in
Sweden and Finland in 1987 and 1988, while declining in Denmark
and Norway.
    Iceland needs to try harder to implement its new economic
strategy if any more progress is to be made towards sustained
and balanced non-inflationary growth, the OECD said.

reform will not affect his determination to reign in
expenditures, but his forecasts show a slowing of the decline
in the budget deficit in the late 1980s.
    "Responsible tax reform must be fiscally responsible,"
Wilson said in a speech prepared for the House of Commons.
    Wilson estimated the deficit will fall to 29.3 billion dlrs
in the year ending March 31, 1988, the same level as he
forecast in the February budget.
    And in the year ended this past March, the deficit was
expected to have been one billion dlrs lower than the 32
billion dlr shortfall originally forecast, Wilson said.
    Wilson said in the current 1988 fiscal year
higher-than-anticipated spending, particularly in farm income
support programs, will be offset by higher-than-anticipated
revenues.
    But finance department documents show the pace of deficit
reduction was expected to slow temporarily in fiscal 1989 and
1990 as a result of lower oil and grain prices and the
transition to the reformed taxation system.
    The deficit is expected to total 28.9 billion dlrs in
fiscal 1989 and 28.6 billion dlrs in 1989 and then fall to 26.1
billion dlrs in 1991.
    Wilson was optimistic about the outlook for the Canadian
economy, forcasting gross domestic product would expand 2.8 pct
this year and 3.0 pct in 1988. In 1986 the economy grew by an
actual 3.1 pct.
    Inflation, meanwhile, is expected to stabilize at around
the current four pct level over the next two years.

 ]]></BODY><BODY><![CDATA[The economy faces lackluster growth
and the risk of recession this year if the recent improvement
in U.S. exports should falter, economists say.
    Growth will slow sharply in the next months due to weakness
in the key housing and auto sectors and could be further
hampered unless consumer spending picks up, they say.
    "These factors raise the question: Is there enough strength
to keep the economy from tipping into a recession?" said Lyle
Gramley, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers
Association and a former Federal Reserve Board official.
    The Commerce Department said this week that the economy
grew by a robust 4.8 pct annual rate in the first quarter, but
a U.S. monetary official called it a weak report.
    Housing starts fell 2.7 pct in May, and consumer spending
rose a weak 0.1 per cent.
    "Our two largest visible industries -- autos and housing --
are faltering, but exports are picking up some of the slack, "
Martin Mauro, senior economist for Merrill Lynch Economics,
told Reuters.
    Gramley said he is worried that consumer spending may slow
because inflation is rising faster than real wages.
    To offset this, U.S. exports must continue to rise,
returning enough jobs to the manufacturing sector to boost
personal income and consumption, he says.
    "I expect to see enough improvement in real net exports to
keep a recession from happening, but it is a close call,"
Gramley said.
    Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger told reporters
that the apparent strength in the 4.8 pct growth figure was the
result of a temporary buildup in inventories that will not last
and said the recovery was showing anemia.
    Seger said that with the recovery stumbling along, "The pace
of the economy and the lack of robustness must be factored into
monetary policy" - possibly a signal that the Fed will be
accommodative.
    Most economists predict growth slower than the 3 pct
forecast by the Reagan administration for 1987 and warn that if
the dollar drops suddenly, higher inflation will result and add
to the risk of a recession.
    Mauro said a 0.5 pct rise in industrial production in May
came despite cutbacks in output in the auto industry, where an
inventory overhang still exists.
    He says the boost in production came from smaller
industries like paper, chemicals, and lumber which have
improved sales overseas due to the drop in the dollar.
    "They are not going to be enough for any kind of surge in
economic activity, but I think they will keep us out of a
recession," Mauro said.
    In a speech to financial planners this week, Beryl
Sprinkel, the chief White House economic adviser, predicted the
trade deficit will continue to improve.
    "Prospects for continued economic growth through 1987 and
into 1988 are still quite favorable," he said.
    But private economists raise concerns about a resurgence in
inflation.
    Allen Sinai, chief economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers
Inc., told Congress this week that inflation would rise to 4.5
to five pct this year and stay at that level through 1989 after
a 1.1 pct increase in 1986.
    The rise is coming from a sharply lower dollar, higher oil
and energy prices and rising prices for services, he said.
    "The lesson of history is that once the inflation genie gets
out of the bottle, it continues to persist," he said, adding he
would like the Fed to tighten credit.
    A major factor affecting inflation is the value of the
dollar, which should continue to fall and feed inflation, says
a prominent international banker.
    Rainer Gut, chairman of Credit Suisse, told the National
Press Club that the dollar's downward trend against the yen and
the mark will continue for years because the United States is
the world's largest debtor nation.
    The Swiss banker said the economic indicators point to a
further slackening of activity and called naive the belief that
the five-year boom on world equity markets will go on forever.
"It is very difficult to be optimistic," Gut said.
