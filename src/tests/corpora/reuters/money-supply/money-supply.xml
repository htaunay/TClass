less extended credits averaged 310 mln dlrs in the week to
Wednesday February 25, the Federal Reserve said.
    The Fed said that overall borrowings in the week fell 131
mln dlrs to 614 mln dlrs, with extended credits up 10 mln dlrs
at 304 mln dlrs. The week was the second half of a two-week
statement period. Net borrowings in the prior week averaged 451
mln dlrs.
    Commenting on the two-week statement period ended February
25, the Fed said that banks had average net free reserves of
644 mln dlrs a day, down from 1.34 billion two weeks earlier.
    A Federal Reserve spokesman told a press briefing that
there were no large single day net misses in the Fed's reserve
projections in the week to Wednesday.
    He said that natural float had been "acting a bit
strangely" for this time of year, noting that there had been
poor weather during the latest week.
    The spokesman said that natural float ranged from under 500
mln dlrs on Friday, for which he could give no reason, to
nearly one billion dlrs on both Thursday and Wednesday.
    The Fed spokeman could give no reason for Thursday's high
float, but he said that about 750 mln dlrs of Wednesday's
float figure was due to holdover and transportation float at
two widely separated Fed districts.
    For the week as a whole, he said that float related as of
adjustments were "small," adding that they fell to a negative
750 mln dlrs on Tuesday due to a number of corrections for
unrelated cash letter errors in six districts around the
country.
    The spokesman said that on both Tuesday and Wednesday, two
different clearing banks had system problems and the securities
and Federal funds wires had to be held open until about 2000 or
2100 EST on both days.
    However, he said that both problems were cleared up during
both afternoons and there was no evidence of any reserve
impact.
    During the week ended Wednesday, 45 pct of net discount
window borrowings were made by the smallest banks, with 30 pct
by the 14 large money center banks and 25 pct by large regional
institutions.
    On Wednesday, 55 pct of the borrowing was accounted for by
the money center banks, with 30 pct by the large regionals and
15 pct by the smallest banks.
    The Fed spokesman said the banking system had excess
reserves on Thursday, Monday and Tuesday and a deficit on
Friday and Wedndsday. That produced a small daily average
deficit for the week as a whole.
    For the two-week period, he said there were relatively high
excess reserves on a daily avearge, almost all of which were at
the smallest banks.

the central bank voted to maintain the existing degree of
pressure on banking reserves at its regular policy-making
meeting two weeks ago, money market economists said.
    "The numbers were a little disappointing, but I think we
can take Mr Volcker at his word when he said that nothing had
changed," said Bob Bannon of Security Pacific National Bank.
    Fed Chairman Paul Volcker told a Congressional committee
last Thursday that the Fed's policy "has been unchanged up to
today."
    Although Volcker's statement last Thursday allayed most
fears that the Fed had marginally tightened its grip on
reserves to help an ailing dollar, many economists still wanted
confirmation of a steady policy in today's data, which covered
the two-week bank statement period ended yesterday.
    This need for additional reassurance was made all the more
acute by the Fed's decision yesterday to drain reserves from
the banking system by arranging overnight matched sale-purchase
agreements for the first time since April of last year,
economists added.
    Today's data showed that the draining action was for a
fairly large 3.9 billion dlrs, economists said.
    "The one thing that caught my eye were the relatively
sizeable matched sales on Wednesday," said Dana Johnson of
First National Bank of Chicago. "But there was a clearly
justified need for them. There was nothing ominous."
    "The Fed couldn't have waited until the start of the new
statement period today. If it had, it would have missed its
(reserve) projections," added Security Pacific's Bannon.
    A Fed spokesman told reporters that there were no large
single-day net miss in reserve projections in the latest week.
    Economists similarly shrugged off slightly higher-than-
expected adjusted bank borrowings from the Fed's discount
window, which averaged 310 mln dlrs a day in the latest week,
compared with many economists' forecasts of about 200 mln.
    For the two-week bank statement period as a whole, the
daily borrowing average more than doubled to 381 mln dlrs from
160 in the prior period.
    "There were wire problems at two large banks on Tuesday and
Wednesday, so I am not too bothered about the borrowings," said
Scott Winningham of J.S. Winningham and Co. The Wednesday
average rose to 946 mln dlrs from 148 mln a week earlier.
    Lending further support to the stable policy view was a
relatively steady federal funds rate of about six pct in the
latest week and persistently high levels of excess reserves in
the banking system, economists said.
    "For the time being, the Fed is following a neutral path,
with fed funds at about six to 6-1/8 pct," said Darwin Beck of
First Boston Corp. "I expect it to continue in that vein."
    "Excess reserves fell but they are still over a billion
dlrs," added First Chicago's Johnson. Banks' excess reserves
averaged 1.03 billion dlrs a day in the latest statement
period, down from 1.50 billion in the previous one.
    After the Fed declined to assign a 1987 target growth range
to the wayward M-1 money supply measure last week, little
attention was paid to a steeper-than-anticipated 2.1 billion
dlr jump in the week ended February 16.
    Looking ahead, economists said the Fed will have to tread a
fine line between the dollar's progress in the international
currency markets and the development of the domestic economy.
    "The market has perhaps exaggerated the dollar's effect on
Fed policy," said First Chicago's Johnson. "Of course, it will
take the dollar into account in future policy decisions but if
the economy is weak, it won't pull back from easing."

New Zealand are not expected to continue at current levels
following the Reserve Bank's move to tighten liquidity late
last year, Reserve Bank Governor Spencer Russell said.
    The monetary and credit growth figures for the December
quarter were probably artifically inflated by unusually high
growth in inter-institutional lending activity on the short
term money market, Russell said in a statement.
    The bank moved to tighten liquidity when the initial signs
of the recent expansion became apparent in September and
October last year, Russell said.
    Broadly defined M-3 figures released today showed growth of
17.8 pct in the year ended December compared with 13.1 pct in
the year ended September.
    Annual growth of private sector credit in calendar 1986 was
30.7 pct compared with 16.5 pct in the September year.
    "Available evidence suggests that corporate customers,
including non-bank financial institutions, have been exploiting
differences between interest rates on overdrafts with trading
banks and rates in the call market," Russell said.

reserve requirement for banks and savings banks to 19 pct of
deposits from 18 pct to drain excess liquidity which threatened
money supply and inflation targets.
    In a statement issued late last night, the central bank
said the measure would take effect from March 13.
    "In recent weeks, there has been excess liquidity in the
Spanish economy which, if not controlled, would threaten the
monetary and inflation targets set by the government," the
statement said.
    Banking sources said the measure would drain about 200
billion pesetas from the system. The maximum reserve
requirement allowed by law is 20 pct.
    The move follows a half-point increase yesterday in the
Bank of Spain's key overnight call money rate, which now stands
at 13.5 pct. At today's auction, however, the bank left the
rate unchanged.
    Spain's principal measure of money supply, the broad-based
liquid assets in public hands (ALP), grew at annualised rate of
8.3 pct in January compared with 11.4 pct during the whole of
1986 and a target of eight pct for 1987.
    Banking sources said that although the January money supply
figures were good, compared with annualised rates of 13.9 pct
in December and 10.2 pct in January 1986, ALP growth appeared
to have accelerated in February, raising government concern.
    Regarding inflation, recent figures have suggested that
prices were under control.

 ]]></BODY><BODY><![CDATA[U.S. money supply growth is slowing
down rapidly, and some economists believe that all three of the
Federal Reserve's main monetary aggregates may even have
contracted in February.
    A contraction is unlikely to be a major concern for the
Fed, especially as it would follow a long period of torrid
growth, but it could give the central bank extra leeway in the
weeks ahead if it decided that a relaxation of monetary policy
was justified on account of weakness in the economy.    
    M-1 money supply for the week ended February 23, reported
today, rose 1.9 billion dlrs to 738.5 billion, but preliminary
forecasts call for a drop next week of around two billion dlrs.
The monthly average in January was 737.1 billion dlrs.
    M-1 makes up about a quarter of M-2 and a fifth of M-3.
With other components of M-2, such as money-market deposit
accounts and small time deposits, also falling, the stage is
set for falls in the broader aggregates too, economists say.
    M-1 has been largely discredited because its traditional
link to economic growth has disintegrated under the impact of
falling interest rates and banking deregulation.
    But the consistent behavior of all three aggregates is
likely to impress the Fed, said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch
Economics Inc.
    "The Fed has confidence in the aggregates when they're all
sending the same signal. This is going to raise some eyebrows
at the Fed," McCarthy said.
    Stephen Slifer of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc added, "We
have some very good-looking monetary aggregate data. It's
coming in a lot weaker than I thought."    
    The economists were quick to caution that one month's data
prove nothing, especially because money growth previously had
been so rapid. M-1 in the last 52 weeks has grown at a 16.7 pct
rate and at a 19.1 pct rate in the past 13 weeks.
    Moreover, some of the contraction in M-2 can probably be
explained by a shift of funds from savings vehicles into the
booming stock market and is thus not an indication of a
slowdown in the business expansion.
    But the data raise the tantalizing possibility for the bond
markets that the slowdown in money growth is partly a
reflection of a weaker economy that needs more Fed stimulus.
    McCarthy noted that the slower money growth coincides with
signs that the economy is losing momentum as the quarter
progresses. "Some of the economic indicators are not as rosy as
they were a month ago," he noted.
    He expects only five to six pct M-1 growth in March and
rises in M-2 and M-3 of about four pct.
    Slifer sees stronger growth of 10 pct in M-1 and five pct
or less for M-2 and M-3, but the rates would still be moderate
enough to encourage the Fed to ease policy if gross national
product for the first quarter proved to be weak. "You'd
certainly be more inclined to ease than you would in the past."
    There was certainly nothing in the Fed's latest balance
sheet, however, to suggest a change of policy is already under
way, economists said. Discount window borrowings were in line
with expectations at 233 mln dlrs a day.
    Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc
argued that an easier Fed policy is unlikely to do much to
solve America's most urgent economic problem, its massive trade
deficit. Because of the possibility that further dollar
depreciation - and thus rising inflation - may be needed to
close the trade gap, Brusca said "I'm not prepared to be all
that optimistic about the bond market."

U.K. Private sector in February is estimated to have risen by
an underlying, seasonally-adjusted 1.6 billion stg after a 1.2
billion stg rise in January, the Banking Information Service
said.
    The unadjusted rise was 1.31 billion stg, compared with an
813 mln stg increase in January.
    The Banking Information Service said the adjusted rise of
1.6 billion stg was well above the recent monthly average of
about 1.0 billion stg.
    Of the increase, 297 mln stg was accounted for by personal
lending, which the Banking Information Service said was taken
up entirely by lending for home purchases.
    Lending for consumption fell around 17 mln stg while about
182 mln stg of credit card debt was repaid during the month.
    Lending to the manufacturing industry was up 370 mln stg,
and to leasing companies by 308 mln stg.
    The Banking Information Service said February fell within
the governmemnt tax season, so much of the lending was probably
the result of industry's need to pay its tax bills.

while M0 rose four to 4-1/4 pct after a 5.2 pct rise in

    Of the unadjusted counterparts to sterling M3, bank lending
to the private sector expanded 2.6 billion stg after a 1.4
billion rise in January, the Bank said.
    The public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) contracted
by 300 mln stg after a contraction of 3.7 billion stg in
January.
    Funding - debt sales to the non-bank private sector and
external flows to the public sector - rose by 300 mln stg after
a 1.5 billion stg rise in January. Of this, central government
debt sales to the public sector were expansionary by 400 mln
stg after a 1.3 billion expansion in January, the Bank said.
    Other unadjusted counterparts to sterling M3 expanded by
300 mln stg in February after an expansion of 1.3 billion stg
in January, the Bank said.
    Unadjusted figures showed a rise in sterling M3 by 1-3/4 to
two pct in February after a drop of 0.8 pct in January.
    On the same basis, the figures showed a drop of about 1-1/2
pct in MO in February after a sharp 6-1/2 pct fall in January.

    The Bank said non-bank private sector holdings of public
sector debt fell by about 400 mln stg in February while
external flows to the public sector were about 100 mln stg.
    Combined with a net PSBR repayment of about 300 mln stg,
the public sector contribution to the growth in sterling M3 was

    Total borrowings in the week rose 83 mln dlrs to 502 mln
dlrs, with extended credits up three mln dlrs at 274 mln dlrs.
The week was the first half of a two-week statement period. Net
borrowing in the prior week averaged 148 mln dlrs.
    Commenting on the two-week statement period that ended on
March 11, the Fed estimated that banks had daily average net
free reserves of 759 mln dlrs rather than the 660 mln dlrs
first reported.
    A Fed spokesman told a press briefing that there were no
large single day net misses in the Fed's reserve projections in
the first week of the latest bank statement period.
    None of the 14 large money center banks borrowed from the
discount window during the week and all of the Wednesday
borrowing was made by the smallest banks. For the week as a
whole, the borrowing was split roughly evenly between the large
regionals and the small banks.
    Natural float ranged from a low of near zero on Thursday --
for which the Fed spokesman could give no particular reason --

    The Tuesday peak included about 100 mln dlrs of

 ]]></BODY><BODY><![CDATA[West Germany's money supply growth
slowed in February after January's sharp rise but the trend is
still definitely upward, the Bundesbank said in a statement.
    Growth in the traditionally broad M3 aggregate was only
moderate in February. While cash in circulation, deposits with
statutory withdrawal notice and sight deposits grew sharply,
short-term time deposits fell after expanding unusually
strongly in January.
    In the six months to February, M3, which excludes holdings
of German non-banks abroad, grew at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 8.5 pct after 9.8 in the six months to January.
    Compared with February 1986, M3 rose 7-1/2 pct.
    In the six months to February, M2, which excludes time
deposits with statutory withdrawal notice, rose at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 8.8 pct and M1, which consists of cash
and sight deposits, rose seven pct.
    International transactions of non-banks again led to a
significant inflow of funds, the Bundesbank said.
    Net claims of commercial banks and the Bundesbank against
foreigners, refecting these foreign payments, increased by 9.1
billion marks in February, little changed from January's rise.
    But in contrast to January, the dampening effect of the
inflow on domestic credit demand outweighed the expansionary
effect on money growth, the Bundesbank said.
    Outstanding bank credits to companies and private
individuals remained virtually unchanged in February.
    A sharp drop in short-term company credits, which reflected
the foreign funds inflow, was balanced by a moderate rise in
long-term credits and a sharp rise in credits for securities.
    At the end of February total bank credits to the private
sector were 4-1/2 pct above the February 1986 level.
    The effect of public authority cash movements on the money
supply was slightly expansive, the Bundesbank said.
    Although banks acquired large amounts of public authority
paper, public authorities drew down book credits at commercial
banks and the Bundesbank.
    Capital formation strengthened in February and slowed money
supply growth to a larger extent than in January.
    A total of 7.7 billion marks in long-term funds was placed
with banks after 6.6 billion the previous month.

deposits, certificates of deposits and bond's, are running at
about 37 pct of gross national product (GNP).
    GNP rose by 14.35 pct in 1986 to 2.74 trillion dlrs.
    Taiwan's strict foreign exchange controls and lack of
incentives to invest abroad mean its huge export earnings are
mainly deposited in bank savings accounts, earning below four

 ]]></BODY><BODY><![CDATA[The Federal Open Market Committee at
its February 10-11 meeting voted nine to one to maintain the
then-existing degree of reserve restraint, minutes showed.
    The FOMC issued an asymmetric inter-meeting policy
directive which gave greater possibility to firmer rather than
easier policy. The Committee set a six to seven pct January
through March annualized growth target for M-2 and M-3 and no
M-1 goal. At the prior meeting in mid-December, the FOMC set a
seven pct target for M-2 and M-3 for November through March.
    The February FOMC kept the four to eight pct Federal funds
rate "reference" range for policy, as in other recent meetings.
    At a telephone conference on February 23, committee members
discussed the possible implications of the decisions reached in
Paris for U.S. intervention in foreign exchange markets. No
conclusions were contained in the minutes.
    In its inter-meeting policy directive, the February FOMC
said that "somewhat greater reserve restraint would, or
slightly lesser reserve restraint might, be acceptable
depending on the behavior of the aggregates, taking into
account the strength of the business expansion, developments in
foreign exchange markets, progress against inflation, and
conditions in domestic and international credit markets."
    The February FOMC voted nine to one for an unchanged
policy. Thomas Melzer, St Louis Federal Reserve Bank president
favored some tightening of reserve conditions.
    He noted the strong growth in bank loans in November
through January and the firm federal funds rate that had
prevailed despite the extraordinary pace of reserve growth. He
also cited the recent declines in the dollar's value.
    Finally, looking ahead, Melzer pointed out the potential
for a further rise in inflationary expectations. He believed
that prompt restraints might avert the need for more
substantial tightening later.
    Regarding inter-meeting policy adjustments, the FOMC
minutes showed, "the members generally felt that policy
implementation should be especially alert to the potential need
for some firming of reserve conditions."
    In this view, the FOMC said somewhat greater reserve
restraint would be warranted if monetary growth did not slow in
line with current expectations and there were concurrent
indications of intensifying inflationary pressures against the
background of stronger economic data.
    One indication of potential price pressure might be a
further tendency for the dollar to weaken.
    The minutes showed that one member, presumably Melzer,
preferred a directive that did not contemplate any easing
during the weeks ahead. However, "most of the members did not
want to rule out the possibility of some slight easing during
the inter-meeting period, although they did not view the
conditions for such a move as likely to emerge."
    The FOMC members assumed that future fluctuations in the
dollar's value would not be of sufficient magnitude to have any
significant effect on the Fed's economic projections. In
addition, they anticipated that considerable progress would be
made in reducing the federal budget deficit.

Federal Reserve Board, said he expects "more modest levels" of
growth in the money supply this year.
    "In my view, this would not only be a logical, but also a
most desireable development," he said in a speech prepared for
delivery to an economic forum at Chapman College in Orange,
Calif.
    A text was released in Washington.
    He said the effect of lower inflation and financial
deregulation on monetary aggregates was now largely finished.
    "Consequently, monetary growth may return to more modest
levels," Heller said. He noted growth in the money supply slowed
after mid-January.
    "I would not be surprised at all if the monetary aggregates
were to grow rather slowly during the balance of the year as
well," he added.
    Heller said there was a danger of renewed price inflation.
    "The pricing behavior of American producers in response to
price increases of their foreign competitors will be crucial
for our economic future," he said.
    Widespread domestic price rises in response to rising
import prices would "generalize the inflationary forces
emanating from the foreign trade sector" and might not gain more
market share for U.S. producers.
    "A return to the stagflation of the late 1970s may well be
the result of such a behavior pattern," Heller warned.
    He said "we at the Federal Reserve will have to be
disciplined in our conduct of monetary policy." 
    Heller said said the government should also exercise fiscal
discipline and cut the deficit by spending restraint rather
than new taxes.
    "The imposition of new taxes would tend to rekindle
inflation and certainly would not make us more competitive in
international markets," Heller said.
    He said the U.S. economy should expand by nearly three pct
during 1987, aided by higher exports to Europe and Canada.
    A free trade agreement currently being negotiated with
Canada "would be exceedingly helpful in allowing American
producers to compete more effectively in that country," Heller
said.

the recent rapid rise of the Tokyo stock and yen bond markets
for their impact on inflation, governor Satoshi Sumita said.
    In a statement to the bank's regional branch managers,
Sumita said the central bank was particularly monitoring the
markets because of the recent rapid growth of money supply. He
said he is also carefully watching real estate prices.
    Sumita said he expects money supply growth to remain high
from April through June. In March, money supply, as measured by

too distorted to draw sweeping conclusions about monetary
policy, but they do support the market's assumption that the
Federal Reserve has started to tighten its grip on credit,
economists said.
    "It's clear that the Fed has firmed somewhat. Discount
window borrowings, net free reserves, the Fed funds rate
average and the pattern of reserve additions are all consistent
with a modest tightening," said Dana Johnson of First Chicago
Corp.
    Johnson, and several other economists, now estimate that
the Fed funds rate should trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8 pct.
    Discount window borrowings in the week to Wednesday were
935 mln dlrs a day, producing a daily average for the two-week
statement period of 689 mln dlrs, the highest since the week of
December 31, 1986, and up from 393 mln dlrs previously.
    Moreover, banks were forced to borrow a huge 5.2 billion
dlrs from the Fed on Wednesday - the highest daily total this
year - even though unexpectedly low Treasury balances at the
Fed that day left banks with over two billion dlrs more in
reserves than the Fed had anticipated.
    However, economists said it is almost certain that the Fed
is aiming for much lower discount window borrowings than
witnessed this week. They pointed to two factors that may have
forced banks to scramble for reserves at the end of the week.
    First, economists now expect M-1 money supply for the week
ended April 29 to rise by a staggering 15 to 20 billion dlrs,
partly reflecting the parking in checking accounts of the
proceeds from stock market sales and mutual fund redemptions to
pay annual income taxes.
    As banks' checking-account liabilities rise, so do the
reserves that they are required to hold on deposit at the Fed.
    Required reserves did indeed rise sharply by 2.5 billion
dlrs a day in the two weeks ended Wednesday, but economists
said the Fed may not have believed in the magnitude of the
projected M-1 surge until late in the week and so started to
add reserves too late.
    Second, an apparent shortage of Treasury bills apparently
left Wall Street dealers with too little collateral with which
to enagage in repurchase agreements with the Fed, economists
said. Thus, although there were 10.3 billion dlrs of repos
outstanding on Wednesday night, the Fed may have wanted to add
even more reserves but was prevented from doing so.
    "It's not at all inconceivable that the Fed didn't add as
much as they wanted to because of the shortage of collateral,"
said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Economics Inc.
    McCarthy estimated that the Fed is now targetting
discount-window borrowings of about 400 mln dlrs a day,
equivalent to a Fed funds rate of around 6-3/8 pct.
    After citing the reasons why the Fed probably has not
tightened credit to the degree suggested by the data,
economists said the fact that the Fed delayed arranging 
overnight injections of reserves until the last day of the
statement period was a good sign of a more restrictive policy.
    Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank had not been convinced that
the Fed was tightening policy. But after reviewing today's
figures, he said, "It's fair to say that the Fed may be moving
toward a slightly less accommodative reserve posture."
    Leeds expects Fed funds to trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8
pct and said the Fed is unlikely to raise the discount rate
unless the dollar's fall gathers pace.
    Johnson at First Chicago agreed, citing political
opposition in Washington to a dollar-defense package at a time
when Congress sees further dollar depreciation as the key to
reducing the U.S. trade surplus with Japan.

1.5 pct in March and 11.3 pct in the 12 months to March, the
Reserve Bank said.
    This compared with a revised rise of 0.5 pct in February
and 11.1 pct in the year to end-February.
    The Reserve Bank said the M-3 data for March was affected
by the start of the operations of <National Mutual Royal
Savings Bank Ltd>, which has resulted in the transfer of
deposits (equivalent to around 1.5 pct of m-3) from the United
Permanent Building Society to National Mutual Royal Savings
Bank Ltd.
    The Reserve Bank said M-3 money supply in March was 110.77
billion Australian dlrs compared with a revised 109.11 billion
in February and 99.48 billion in March, 1986.
    M-3 is deposits of the private sector held by trading and
savings banks plus holdings of notes and coins.

announced next Thursday is expected to show one of the largest
one-week increases in history, analysts said.
    The average forecast of economists polled by Reuters calls
for a 17.7 billion dlr M-1 jump for the week ended April 20.
Estimates of the increase range from five billion dlrs to 26.3
billion dlrs.
    "The M-1 surge will be very temporary. About two thirds of
the increase is likely to be washed out in the following week,"
said Kim Rupert, an economist at Money Market Services Inc.
    Rupert said a huge increase in M-1 for the April 20 week is
implied by very strong deposit survey data and by an
unexpectedly sharp gain in required reserves in Federal Reserve
data released Thursday.
    Those numbers, covering the two-week bank statement period
that ended on April 22, show a 2.5 billion dlr jump in basic
required reserves. Economists said this largely reflected the
parking in checking accounts of the proceeds from stock market
sales and mutual fund redemptions to pay annual income taxes.
Fed seasonal adjustments do not adequately compensate for these
and other special factors.
    Analysts noted that income tax refunds from the Treasury
also appear to be coming earlier than usual.
    They also are not adequately compensated for by the Fed's
seasonal adjustment factors to the money supply.
    The Federal Reserve is no longer targeting M-1 because the
link between M-1 and economic growth has largely been severed
by financial market innovation and deregulation.
    As such, there is likely to be little financial market
reaction to the huge M-1 increase that is expected to be
announced next week.

must be careful about introducing credit instruments to avoid
the risk of an uncontrolled credit expansion.
    It said: "The introduction of credit, while undoubtedly
facilitating business, could result in unhealthy expansion of
the volume of money in circulation..." adding that the ordinary
consumer must learn how to use credit wisely.
     The paper said in an editorial that "a sound approach and
one that will not entail the risks of introducing uncontrolled
expansion of credit into the monetary system is the present one
of issuing renminbi in larger denomications."
    Today, the first two of nine new bank notes, including
notes for 50- and 100-yuan were introduced. The largest
denomination had been 10 yuan.
    The paper said the new notes are necessary because of the
rapid development of the economy, which has made it
inconvenient to carry large amounts of cash in small
denominations.
    Economists have been urging that personal cheques, buying
on instalment, letters of credit and credit cards be introduced
more widely, it added.

at about seven pct in the first quarter of 1987, down from
9-1/2 pct in the second half of 1986, so there are signs that
the pace of growth is slowing even though it is still above
target, the Bundesbank said in its 1986 annual report.
    The Bundesbank set a target range of three to six pct
growth from fourth quarter 1986 to fourth quarter 1987 for
central bank money stock. In the previous year it grew 7.7 pct,
outside the 3-1/2 to 5-1/2 pct target range.
    The Bundesbank noted that monetary policy in 1986 was
limited by a series of external factors.
    These included the revaluation of the mark, growing foreign
payments surpluses of non-banks, and currency inflows.
    The Bundesbank therefore tolerated the monetary overshoot
in 1986, as an attempt to counter monetary expansion with
interest rate and liquidity moves would have increased upward
pressure on the mark, it said.
    The lower end of the 1987 target range would be realistic
if a large part of funds currently held in a liquid form were
invested in long-term bank accounts or bonds, public bonds or
foreign securities, the Bundesbank said.
    But if companies and private households continue to hold
their funds in liquid forms, or if there are further currency
inflows, growth will be closer to the upper end of the range.
    "The more the conflict between external constraints and
domestic objectives relaxes -- and many things point to this at
the time of writing this report -- the more possible it will be
to do justice again to the medium-term concept of money supply
control," the Bundesbank said.
    It noted that prices were beginning to tend upwards again
at the start of 1987.
    There would be virtually no easing of other production
costs in 1987 to compensate for the rise in unit-wage costs.
    "Nevertheless, no inflationary trends are likely to set in
this year," the Bundesbank said.
    A link between excessive monetary growth and intensifying
price rises can only be observed in the long term, it added.
    The continuing trend for non-banks to switch into long-term
borrowing to take advantage of low interest rates, while for
the same reason shunning long-term investments, increases the
risks in changing interest rates for banks refinancing
themselves with variable-interest deposits, it added.

not expected to accelerate, but will remain at high levels
between 11 and 12 pct, a senior Bank of Japan official said.
    The central bank will keep a watch on high growth in
liquidity because this is a factor that may cause rises in
