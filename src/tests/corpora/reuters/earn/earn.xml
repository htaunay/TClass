fourth quarter ending May 30 to exceed those of the same
year-ago period, Chairman Kenneth Douglas told analysts.
    In the fiscal 1986 fourth quarter the food processor
reported earnings of 40 cts a share.
    Douglas also said the year's sales should exceed 1.4
billion dlrs, up from 1.27 billion dlrs the prior year.
    He repeated an earlier projection that third-quarter
earnings "will probably be off slightly" from last year's 40
cts a share, falling in the range of 34 cts to 36 cts a share.
    Douglas said it was too early to project whether the
anticipated fourth quarter performance would be "enough for us
to exceed the prior year's overall earnings" of 1.53 dlrs a
share.
    In 1988, Douglas said Dean should experience "a 20 pct
improvement in our bottom line from effects of the tax reform
act alone."
    President Howard Dean said in fiscal 1988 the company will
derive  benefits of various dairy and frozen vegetable
acquisitions from Ryan Milk to the Larsen Co.
    Dean also said the company will benefit from its
acquisition in late December of Elgin Blenders Inc, West
Chicago.
    He said the company is a major shareholder of E.B.I. Foods
Ltd, a United Kingdom blender, and has licensing arrangements
in Australia, Canada, Brazil and Japan.
    "It provides ann entry to McDonalds Corp <MCD> we've been
after for years," Douglas told analysts.

has approved a three-for-two stock split and a 35 pct increase
in the company cash dividend.
    The company cited its improved earnings outlook and
continued strong cash flow as reasons for raising the dividend.
    Brown-Forman said the split of its Class A and Class B
common shares would be effective March 13.
    The company said directors declared a quarterly cash
dividend on each new share of both classes of 28 cts, payable
April one to holders of record March 20. Prior to the split,
the company had paid 31 cts quarterly.
    Brown-Forman today reported a 37 pct increase in third 
quarter profits to 21.6 mln dlrs, or 1.00 dlr a share, on a
seven pct increase in sales to a record 337 mln dlrs.
    Brown-Forman said nine month profits declined a bit to 66.0
mln dlrs, or 3.07 dlrs a share, from 66.2 mln dlrs, or 3.08
dlrs a share, a year earlier due to a second quarter charge of
37 cts a share for restructuring its beverage operations.
    The company said lower corporate tax rates and the
restructuring "are expected to substantially improve
Brown-Forman's earnings and cash flow in fiscal 1988."

    An NTT spokesman said increased competition from new

major factors behind the projected decrease in profits.

corporations, excluding financial institutions, are forecast to
fall 19.2 pct in the 1986/87 year ending March 31, compared to
the 19.9 pct decline projected in late November, Wako Research
Institute of Economics said.
    The private research body also said in a statement that 437
of the 1,084 firms listed on the first section of the Tokyo
Stock Exchange foresee an 11.6 pct fall in sales in the year
against an 11.4 pct fall estimated last November.
    Current profits are projected to fall 4.4 pct in 1987/88 on
sales seen increasing by 4.2 pct, it said.
    Rationalisation measures taken by manufacturing industries
to cope with the yen's sharp rise are beginning to brighten
their business outlook, the institute said.
    It said lower interest rates, which are expected to reduce
corporate borrowing costs, are also behind the improved
performance outlook.
    Earnings performance in the non-manufacturing sector will
be supported by firm demand in the real estate and construction
businesses, it said.
    The forecast was based on average exchange rate estimates
of 160 yen to the dollar in 1986/87 and 155 yen in 1987/88.

expects satisfactory profits in 1987 and will pay a higher
dividend for the year, chairman Li Ka-shing said.
    He did not make any specific projections for the company's
earnings this year but he said the firm will pay a dividend of
not less than 32.5 cents per share after a proposed
four-for-one stock split and a one-for-four bonus issue.
    It paid total dividends of 1.30 dlrs per share last year,
equal to 26 cents per share, adjusting for the bonus and share
split.
    Hutchison, which has operations ranging from trading to
property and container terminals, earlier reported after-tax
profits of 1.62 billion dlrs against 1.19 billion dlrs in 1985.
    The 1986 total excluded extraordinary gains of 563 mln
dlrs, partly from the sale of some of its stake in the South
China Morning Post, the leading English language newspaper,
compared with 369 mln dlrs the previous year. It said it
expects another 277 mln dlr gain in 1987 from the sale of the
remaining shares.
    Li said Hong Kong's property market remains strong while
its economy is performing better than forecast with its largely
export-led growth.
    Gross domestic product grew by nearly nine pct last year
against an initial government projection of 4.5 pct.
    But he said Hong Kong's large trade deficit with the U.S.
May result in protectionist measures that will adversely affect
the British colony.
    He said all of the company's major operations showed
improved results in 1986.
    Hutchison said earlier it will sell its entire 23.5 pct
interest in Hongkong Electric Holdings Ltd <HKEH.HK> to
<Cavendish International Holdings Ltd>, itself a spin-off from
Hongkong Electric.
    Under a reorganisation announced separately, Hongkong
Electric will spin off all its non-electricity related
activities into Cavendish, which will be listed on the local
stock exchange. Hongkong Electric shareholders will receive one
share in Cavendish for every Hongkong Electric share.
    Cavendish will buy the 348.2 mln Hongkong Electric shares
from Hutchison by issuing 975 mln new shares.
    The spin-off and the sale of Hongkong Electric shares will
give Hutchison a 53 pct stake in Cavendish.
    Li said the decision to spin-off Cavendish is to relieve
Hongkong Electric of public criticism of the power company for
making risky investments. But he denied there was pressure from
the government for the spin-off.
    He said Cavendish will have seven billion dlrs of assets
and will be almost debt free, with 340 mln dlrs of liabilites.
Its major assets are the Hong Kong Hilton Hotel, property
development, and interests in Husky Oil Ltd <HYO.TO> of Canada
and Pearson Plc <PSON.L> of Britain.

is expecting strong results this year after reporting better
than expected profits in 1986, chairman Li Ka-shing said.
    He did not give a specific earnings projection but he told
reporters the firm will pay total dividends of not less than 19
cents a share this year after a one-for-four bonus issue and a
four-for-one stock split.
    The company earlier declared total dividends equal to 15
cents a share for 1986, adjusting for the stock split and bonus
issue.
    Cheung Kong's earnings rose to 1.28 billion H.K. Dlrs in
1986, well above market expectations of 920 mln to one billion
dlrs. They compared with profits of 551.7 mln dlrs in 1985.
    Cheung Kong also reported extraordinary gains of 983.6 mln
dlrs mainly from the firm's sale of the Hong Kong Hilton Hotel
to Hongkong Electric Holdings Ltd <HKEH.HK> for one billion
dlrs. It had gains of 81.3 mln dlrs in 1985.
    Li attributed the surge in 1986 earnings to a buoyant local
property market and substantial increases in contributions from
associated companies.
    "Looking ahead, 1987 should be another year of stability for
the property market," Li said. "The growth in (Hong Kong's)
exports is expected to stimulate the demand for industrial
buildings."
    Cheung Kong is cash rich and is looking for new projects in
the British colony, Li said, noting the firm is interested in a
land reclamation project along the Hong Kong harbour and is
exchanging views with the government on a proposal to build a
second airport.

chief executive officer Sigi Ziering said he expects to
maintain the same compound average annal net income growth in
1987 as the company has for the past five years.
    "We expect the same performance in net income over the next
five years as we have had in the past," Ziering said.
    Over the past five years Ziering said the company has had
average compound net income growth of 32 pct annually with a 27
pct per year growth in earnings per share. For 1986 the company
had net income of 6.3 mln dlrs, or 1.07 dlrs per share, vs 3.9
mln dlrs, or 73 cts per share in 1985.
    Diagnostic manufactures medical immunological diagnostic
test kits.
    Ziering said he expects the earnings growth to result from
positive effect of the weaker dollar on the company's exports
sales as well as accelerated market penetration. Ziering said
he expected the Food and Drug Administration to approve three
more of its drug abuse test kits by the end of the year, which,
depending on approval, should also help earnings growth.
    Ziering said as a result of the new tax laws he expected
the company's taxes to decrease by five pct to 31 pct of net
income in 1987.

pay a final 1986 dividend of not less than 10 cents a share
after July 1, making 13 cents for the year against 15 in 1985.
    The mining and smelting group earlier reported 1986 net
earnings rose to 138.2 mln dlrs from 87.8 mln in 1985, against
analysts' forecasts yesterday of 125 mln to 160 mln.
    CRA said it was deferring consideration of a dividend until
later this year to provide the benefit of dividend imputation
to its shareholders. After July 1, dividends will be tax-free
to shareholders provided they come out of earnings on which the
full 49 pct company tax rate has been p id.
    The company operates on a substituted tax year, not the
fiscal year ending June 30, and as a result has incurred tax at
the 49 pct rate on 1986 earnings, CRA said in a statement.
    Consequently, it has funds available for distribution with
dividend imputed but is waiting to see the imputation
legislation before determining the final payout, it said.
    Despite the higher net earnings, CRA said 1986 was a poor
year for the minerals industry, with the notable exception of
gold producers.
    Prices for major metals expressed in real U.S. Dollars
declined to the lowest levels in about 50 years, it said.
    Fluctuating exchange and interest rates added volatility
and uncertainty, while the revaluation of the yen is leading to
substantial restructuring of Japanese industry, CRA said.
    World demand for metals is growing slowly. Inventories have
steadily declined, with supply and demand in better balance,
but overcapacity continues, CRA said.
    Turning to contributions to its earnings, CRA said
Bougainville Copper Ltd <BUVA.S> contributed 31.3 mln dlrs
while its share of Comalco Ltd's <CMAC.S> net was 37.8 mln.
    Net earnings from iron-ore operations were 111.8 mln dlrs
against 149.2 mln in 1985, it said.
    Lead, zinc and silver mining and smelting operations
incurred a net loss of 66.8 mln dlrs against a 38.1 mln loss in
1985, CRA said.
    Coal activities resulted in a net profit of 36.7 mln dlrs
against 34.1 mln, while salt raised its contribution to 4.7 mln
from 2.8 mln.
    CRA's share of earnings from the Argyle diamond project
amounted to 12.0 mln dlrs against nine mln in 1985.
    CRA said the main item in its 250.28 mln dlr extraordinary
loss was a 172.9 mln writeoff of unrealised foreign exchange
losses on borrowings as required by a new accounting standard.
    Other extraordinary items were 63.3 mln dlrs provided for
closures and writedown of assets and a 14.1 mln increase in
future tax provisions, CRA said.
    Cash flow continued at a high level, being 950.6 mln dlrs
before capital expenditure against 1.02 billion in 1985. The
strong cash flow, coupled with the proceeds of the 1986 rights
issue and the use of existing cash balances, enabled group debt
to be reduced by nearly 500 mln dlrs.
    CRA said it held forward contracts at year-end to buy 985
mln U.S. Dlrs to hedge part of its foreign debt. This cost 47.0
mln dlrs after tax, included in the net interest cost.

improved performance in almost all sectors during 1986, the
Anglo-Dutch group said in its results statement.
    Very good progress was made last year, while the recent
acquisition of Chesebrough-Pond's Inc <CBM.N> was a significant
addition which will greatly benefit the group in the years to
come.
    Earlier, Unilever reported combined fourth quarter pre-tax
profit of 276 mln stg, level with the year earlier period,
making 1.14 billion stg compared with 953 mln for the 1986 full
year.
    Unilever said it plans to change its depreciation policy to
the more conventional practice of depreciating assets
individually rather than depreciating fixed assets at average
rates. The new method is expected to lead to a reduction in the
accumulated provision for depreciation and thereby increase the
net book value of tangible asssets by about 300 mln stg as at
January 1, 1987.
    Unilever Plc shares are up 25p since yesterday at 2,575p in
buoyant response to the results and share split proposal,
though 1986 profits were not ahead of market forecasts, dealers
added.

Co said it expects to report losses of about 57 mln dlrs for
the fourth quarter and 68 mln dlrs for the full year 1986 on
revenues of about 10 mln dlrs for the quarter and 52 mln dlrs
for the year.
    Equatorial said the losses will include a charge of about
45 mln dlrs from costs associated with the restructuring of its
business, including adjustments to reflect the market value of
transponders owned and leased by Equatorial and other reserves
for inventory, receivables and excess facilities.
    Equatorial said the fourth quarter operating results will
also include restructuring costs of about 5,500,000 dlrs, in
addition to the 45 mln dlr charge.
    Equitorial also said that as of March One it is operating
in technical default under its lease of transponders on the
Galaxy III satellite due to its inabiliuty to maintain
agreed-upon financial ratios.  It said it is in talks with the
lessors in an attempt to restructure lease obligations.
    Further, Equitorial said it is in default of two other
oblitations in connection with the purchase or lease of
transponders as a result of cross-default provisions.
    Equatorial said it has signed a memorandum of understanding
for Contel Corp <CTC> to purchase 10 mln dlrs of Equatorial
master earth stations, micro earth stations and associated
equipment and loan Equatorial six mln dlrs over a six-month
period for repayment starting in December 1988.
    The company said Conteol, under the agreement, would assume
a portion of Equatorial's rights and obligations under the
Galaxy III transponder lease with <Burnham Leasing> on the
occurrence of certain events.
    Equatorial said it would grant Contel an option to buy
about 3,600,000 common shares at 3.25 dlrs each.
    Equatorial said its understandings with Contel are subject
to Equatorial's ability to restructure a significant portion of
its obligations and to obtain concessions from lenders and
lessors, in particular under its Galaxy III transponder lease.
It said it hopes to finalize a Contel agreement by April 15.
    Equatorial in 1985 earned 1,807,000 dlrs after a 3,197,000
dlr gain from early debt retirement on revenues of 56.1 mln
dlrs. For the first nine months of 1986, the company lost
9,476,000 dlrs on revenues of 45.4 mln dlrs, compared with a
1,784,000 dlr profit after the early retirement gain on
revenues of 38.5 mln dlrs.

improvements in margins and underlying sales volume growth of
five pct in 1986 after stripping out the effects of falling
prices, disposals and currency movements, Unilever Plc chairman
Michael Angus said.
    He told reporters that volumes in North America increased
some 10.5 pct while European consumer goods rose about 2.5 pct
after being flat for some years.
    Much of the disposal strategy, aimed at concentrating
activities on core businesses, had now been completed, he
noted.
    But the process of acquisitions would go on, with strategic
acquisitions taking place "from time to time," he said.
    The company earlier reported a 20 pct rise in pre-tax
profits for 1986 to 1.14 billion stg from 953 mln previously.
In guilder terms, however, profits at the pre-tax level dropped
three pct to 3.69 billion from 3.81 billion.
    Angus said the recent purchase of Chesebrough-Pond's Inc
<CBM.N> for 72.50 dlrs a share was unlikely to bring any
earnings dilution.
    However, it would not add much to profits, with much of the
company's operating profits paying for the acquisition costs.
    Finance director Niall Fitzgerald added that while gearing
- debt to equity plus debt - rose to about 60 pct at end 1986
from 35 pct last year, this was expected to drop back to about
40 pct by end-1987.
    The same divergence was made in full year dividend, with
Unilever NV's rising 3.4 pct to 15.33 guilders and Unilever
Plc's increasing 29.9 pct to 50.17p, approximately in line with
the change in attributable profit.
    Angus said the prospectus for the sale of parts of
Chesebrough was due to be published shortly. However, he said
that there was no target date for completing the process.
    He also declined to say what sort of sum Unilever hoped to
realise from the operation, beyond noting that Chesebrough had
paid around 1.25 billion dlrs for Stauffer Chemical Co, which
operates outside Unilever's core activities.
    In the U.S., Organic growth from the Lipton Foods business,
considerable expansion in the household products business and
in margarine had been behind the overall sales increase.
    However, he noted that the U.S. Household products business
had turned in a planned loss, with fourth quarter performance
better than expected despite the anticipated heavy launch costs
of its Surf detergents.

earnings after financial items of one billion crowns in 1987 vs

    Sales would in such circumstances go up to six billion
crowns from 3.65 billion in 1986, it said.
    A weakening Dollar was mainly responsible for a five pct
negative impact on sales during 1986 which the company blamed
on currency movements.
    Last year's results were also badly hit by a once-off
writedown of 520 mln crowns for intangible assets.
    The company said mainly this represented the premium the
group had paid for the know-how of various high-tech firms it
had taken over.
    The accounts also showed a financial deficit of 1.87
billion crowns vs a deficit of 133 mln which was covered partly
by drawing down company liquidity to 738 mln vs one billion and
partly by increasing borrowing to 2.23 billion vs 621 mln.
    Pharmacia said the financial deficit was caused by it
having used more funds than generated by group operations,
mainly because of the 1.36 billion it paid in cash for shares
in LKB-Produkter AB and the assets of Intermedics-Intraocular

estimates 1987 loan losses at one billion dlrs, a 25 mln dlr
increase over last year.
    Royal Bank said it set its provisions "given the continued
debt-servicing problems ... in the North American energy
industry and the uncertain outlook for energy prices," and also
continued to add to its general provisions for loans to
troubled borrower countries.
    The bank's loan loss provision for the first quarter ended
January 31 rose to 223 mln dlrs from 187 mln dlrs in the
year-ago quarter.
    The bank said non-accrual loans, net of provisions for loan
losses, totalled 2.2 billion dlrs on January 31, up from 2.0
billion dlrs a year ago.
    In reporting lower first quarter earnings, chairman Allan
Taylor said problems with credit quality--particularly in loans
associated with the energy sector--continue to have a
substantial adverse effect on the bank's earnings.
    Taylor said profitability of the bank's international
operations remains weak, reflecting resource-related
difficulties of private and public sector borrowers and
unsatisfactory results from capital market activities.
    Taylor said it would be premature to speculate on the
outcome of debt resturcturing negotiations with Brazil or their
potential impact on the Royal Bank.
    The bank earlier reported first quarter profit fell to
114.1 mln dlrs from 140.4 mln dlrs a year ago.

19 pct drop in first quarter earnings, said it expects to
report improved results in future earnings periods.
    "Healthy consumer credit growth, record fee-based income,
highly profitable securities and foreign exchange trading, and
a solid capital position...combined with the restraint of
non-interest expenses, should lead to improved results in the
periods ahead," chairman Allan Taylor said in a statement.
    The bank earlier reported profit for the first quarter
ended January 31 fell to 114 mln dlrs from 140 mln dlrs a year
ago.
    Taylor said loans to the energy sector continue to
substantially hurt earnings while profitability of the bank's
international operations remains weak, reflecting
resource-related difficulties of private and public sector
borrowers and unsatisfactory results from capital market
activities.
    The bank said earnings from domestic operations rose to 103
mln dlrs in the first quarter from 98 mln dlrs a year ago while
earnings from international operations plunged to 11 mln dlrs
from 42 mln dlrs last year.
    Royal Bank said first quarter international net interest
income declined from last year, reflecting reduced revenues
from international investment banking as well as a significant
loss on disposal of its affiliate in Trinidad and Tobago.
    Other income rose to 251 mln dlrs from 220 mln dlrs last
year. The rise was due to higher commercial banking and retail
deposit service fees, and higher foreign exchange revenue but
lower securities commissions from international investment bank
operations partly offset the gains, Royal Bank said.
    The bank said a two billion dlr increase in total assets to
98.7 billion dlrs was due mainly to continued growth in
consumer lending, particularly residential mortgages.

traded NYSE issues, rose today as at least one analyst expected
earnings to be boosted by its planned acquisition of a
micrographics company.
    Anacomp rose 1/2 to 6-3/4 on volume of 950,000 shares after
trading as high as seven earlier.
    Howard Harlow, analyst at Whale Securities Corp, said
Anacomp's earnings for fiscal 1987 ending September 31 could be
doubled to 80 cts a share from the 40 cts a share he had
forecast before Anacomp agreed to buy DatagraphiX, a
micrographics firm, from General Dynamics Corp <GD>.
    "The company can earn 80 cts a share in fiscal 1987, maybe
as much as a dlr a share, because of DatagraphiX," Harlow said.
"Most of the benefit will be in the fourth qtr because it will
integrate the company in the second half."
    Anacomp's earnings will be less if it has problems
integrating DatagraphiX, Harlow said.
    A spokesman at Anacomp said the company expects to complete
its deal for DatagraphiX later this month. She would not say
how much it will pay for DatagraphiX, but noted that
DatagraphiX contributed 10 mln dlrs in earnings to General
Dynamics on revenues of 239 mln dlrs in 1986.
    Harlow said a fellow analyst at Whale Securities estimates
that Anacomp will pay between 100 mln dlrs to 150 mln dlrs for
DatagraphiX. "The estimates on the street narrow it down to
between 110 mln dlrs and 130 mln dlrs," Harlow added.
    Anacomp reported net of 2.8 mln dlrs or nine cts a share in
its first qtr ended December 31, up from 301,000 dlrs or one ct
a share.
    In Anacomp's fiscal 1986 it earned 4,073,000 dlrs or 13 cts
a share.
    Whale Securities recommends buying the stock, Harlow said.

Wall Street analysts said.
    Previously, it was expected the business would peak and
decline at some point in the next five years. The improved
outlook results from AMR Corp's <AMR> decision to order 40 new
planes powered by CF6-80C2 GE engines.
    "Creative financial footwork helped GE get the order," said
Nicholas Heymann, analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
    AMR declined to go into detail on financing arrangements
for its order of 15 Boeing Co <BA> and 25 <Airbus Industrie>
twinjet long distance aircraft.
    But AMR said it was using "rent-a-plane leases" that allow
it to operate the aircraft without adding to its debt
structure. AMR also has the right to decline delivery of the
planes or return them on short notice. The arrangement protects
AMR in the case of an unexpected development such as a severe
downturn in the economy.
    From GE's point of view the package looks like a good deal
for several reasons, Heymann said.
    GE will be able to record revenue as a sale at the time of
delivery, Heymann noted.
    And if for some reason AMR decides not to take the planes
GE's financial arm, General Electric Financial Services Inc,
would have little trouble rounding up another airline that
wanted the fuel efficient planes. On the whole, the deal
appears to pose little risk for GE, Heymann said.
    GE's stock declined 1/4 to 103-1/2 on 625,000 shares by
midafternoon. H.P. Smith, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham
and Co said for a 40 billion dlr (revenue) company "no one
order will have much of an effect on the stock."
    Russell Leavitt, analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc, said the
order "will help to maintain a good level of production and
profitability in the aircraft engine business" for GE.
    Heymann sees operating profits from GE's jet engine
business rising from 870 mln dlrs last year to 1.3 billion dlrs
by 1991.
    Revenue from jet engines was close to six billion dlrs last
year, with well over half of the business in the military
sector, according to analysts' estimates.
    The rosy outlook for GE's jet engine business coincides
with an upbeat performance in other segments.
    Heymann expects GE to earn 1.39 dlrs per share in the first
quarter of 1987. Saying many will be suprised by the results,
he believes GE has shown through its acquisition of RCA Corp
that it has a "unique ability" to buy a major business and
reshape it, pruning some parts and recombining parts with other
elements of its 14 business areas.
    Smith sees GE earning 1.35 dlrs per share in the current
quarter. He credits good results at RCA, in turn aided by the
NBC broadcasting operation, and lower interest rates.
    Leavitt sees 1.40 dlrs for the current quarter, in part
crediting "significant benefits from the RCA acquisition."

to pay off for F.W. Woolworth Co, once known only as a five and
dime store chain, which said its 1986 income rose 21 pct.
    It was the fourth consecutive year of profit increases for
the New York-based retailer which was founded over 100 years
ago.
    Woolworth's 1986 income rose to 214 mln dlrs or 3.25 dlrs
per share compared with 1985's profit of 177 mln or 2.75 dlrs
per share. Revenues for the year rose to 6.50 billion compared
with the prior year's 5.96 billion.
    For the fourth quarter, the company reported profits rose
10 pct to 117 mln dlrs or 1.78 dlrs per share compared with
1985 fourth quarter results of 106 mln or 1.64 dlrs per share.
Revenues rose to 2.02 billion from 1.85 billion dlrs.
    Roy Garofalo, Woolworth vice president, told Reuters that
income generated by the company's specialty store operations
accounted for 52 pct of the parent company's 1986 profits.
    He said the company now has 4,700 specialty stores
operating under 30 different names. Woolworth plans to open 650
more specialty stores in 1987. At this time last year, it
operated 4,100 specialty stores, Garofalo said.
    Garofalo said the largest specialty chain operated by
Woolworth is Kinney Shoe Stores, followed by the Richman
apparel unit. Among other units are Little Folk Shop, a chain
of discount children's apparel stores; The Rx Place, a discount
drug, health and beauty aid operation; and Face Fantasies,
which sells cosmetics. There are currently about 1,700
Woolworth general merchandise stores operating worldwide, of
which 1,200 are in the United States.
    Harold Sells, chairman and chief executive of Woolworth,
said in a statement, "These results are especially gratifying as
they are an improvement over last year's record earnings."
    Sells that it was the fourth successive year earnings in
each quarter improved over the corresponding year-earlier
period.
    Woolworth's variety store operations were hard hit in the
1970's and early 1980's by the quickly growing discount store
industry. In an attempt to compete in the 1970's, Woolworth
opened a discount general store chain, Woolco, and J. Brannam,
a discount apparel chain. Both were failures in the United
States, although Woolco still operates in Canada.
    In 1985, however, Woolworth changed its strategy and
announced that it would operate specialty stores. At that time,
the company said it would create 14 new groups of such stores.
Specialty stores generally have higher sales per square foot
than general merchandise stores.

Allen-Bradley unit, which has suffered from weakness in the
industrial automation market.
    "It is in a soft market now, but we are not concerned. It
is moving forward with market development and is enhancing
market share," Beall said of Allen-Bradley unit.
    Beall, who was in Los Angeles to address a Technology
management conference, said first quarter sales for the
Allen-Bradley unit were flat as compared to a year earlier. He
said the company does not break out operating earnings by unit
on a quarterly basis.
    Beall said the recent trend toward cost sharing in the
research and development phase of government contracts should
not have a major impact on Rockwell's near-term performance.
    He noted, however, the increasing focus on cost sharing
could limit technological innovation.
    "I worry that we are heading into a period of misuse of
contracting approaches too early in the development stages of
important military contracts," Beall said, adding, "long-term,
we have a very serious problem."
    In addition, Beall told the conference the greatest
competitive threat to defense contractors is in defense
electronics, due to the government's attempt to take advantage
of competitively priced products made outside the U.S.

Resources Investment Corp>, earlier reporting higher full year
operating losses, said it reached agreement in principle with
five lenders providing for a 360 mln dlr credit facility over a
four year term.
    The company said the credit facility is extendable under
certain circumstances, with annual principal payments of five
mln dlrs. The agreement is subject to certain lender approvals
and completion of formal documentation.
    It earlier reported 1986 losses before extraordinary items
rose to 26.4 mln dlrs from year-ago 7.2 mln dlrs.
    B.C. Resources also said dividends on its series 2
preferred shares and exchangeable preferred shares will remain
suspended.
    However, payment will be made on account of the quarterly
dividend on the exchangeable preferred shares by the company's
trustee from a deposit account, B.C. Resources said.
    Sufficient funds should be available to pay full amount of
the March 31, 1987 dividend to exchangeable preferred
shareholders, with payment expected in early April to
shareholders of record March 31, the company said.
    If future dividends are not declared after the April
exchangeable preferred quarterly payout, future payment will
depend on the amount of dividends received from Westcoast
Transmission Co <WTC>, B.C. Resources said.
    The company said its increased fourth quarter and full year
operating losses primarily resulted from lower oil prices and a
four month labor shutdown at its Balmer coal mine in British
Columbia.
    B.C. Resources also recorded a 99.9 mln dlr extraordinary
loss, which included losses on disposition of North Sea oil and
gas interests by 67 pct owned <Westar Mining Ltd>.
    B.C. Resources' 1986 extraordinary charge also included a
writedown of its investment in Westar Petroleum. Gains on the
sales of Westar Timber's Skeena and Celgar pulp mills and
Terrace sawmill partially offset the extraordinary loss, the
company said.
    The company said the asset sales have eliminated B.C.
Resources' long term financing commitment in the North Sea and
exposure to the fluctuating pulp market.
    It also said it cut long term debt in 1986 to 900 mln dlrs
from 1.3 billion dlrs at year-end 1985, and management changes
and staff cuts have significantly reduced costs.

of 250 mln dlrs from discontinued operations and writedowns
contributed to a 1986 net loss of 240 mln dlrs or 6.97 dlrs a
share against earnings of 31.6 mln dlrs or 92 cts in 1985.
    The loss in the quarter was 232.3 mln dlrs or 6.75 dlrs
against income of 10.7 mln dlrs or 31 cts a year ago. Revenues
in the quarter fell to 521.1 mln dlrs from 716.9 mln and in the
year fell to 1.9 billion dlrs from 2.5 billion in 1985.
    Williams also said the previously announced sale of its
Agrico Chemical Co unit to Freeport-Mcmoran Resource Partners
Ltd has cleared antitrust review and should close next week.
    The 1987 first quarter will include proceeds from the
Agrico sale, for 250 mln dlrs cash at closing plus deferred
payments, and proceeds of 320 mln dlrs from the sale of a stake
in Peabody Holding Co, completed in January.
    In the 1986 first quarter, Williams reported net of 14.2
mln dlrs or 41 cts a share on sales of 796.4 mln dlrs.
    Williams said the charges in the current year were related
to an ongoing restructuring. The company said the restructuring
moves had improved its balance sheet and improved the outlook
for future stability and growth in earnings.
    Operating profit at the company's Northwest Pipeline Corp
unit fell 4.5 pct to 150 mln dlrs from lower sales. The
Williams Natural Gas unit had operating profit of 50.5 mln dlrs
compared to 90.9 mln dlrs on lower sales volumes.
    Profit at Williams Gas Marketing rose to 26 mln dlrs from
about 22 mln and the William Pipe Line Co had operating profit
of 49.4 mln dlrs versus 63.6 mln dlrs a year ago.

to streamline its branch network to improve its distribution of
financial services, management board member Eberhard-Rainer
Luckey said.
    He told a news conference on 1986 results that branches in
Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein would be merged or closed, a
branch in Frankfurt opened and that the bank was considering
opening a branch in London.
    Luckey said the bank's total operating profits rose nearly
29 pct in 1986. Parent bank net profit rose to 47.7 mln from
42.2 mln and the dividend remained unchanged at 12 marks.
    The group balance sheet, including for the first time
VereinWest Overseas Finance (Jersey), rose 9.2 pct to 17.9
billion marks, Luckey said.
    The parent bank balance sheet rose 89 mln marks to 13.2
billion, while business volume was almost unchanged at 14.8
billion. Credit volume eased to 9.1 billion from 9.2 billion
while loans to companies rose seven pct.
    Foreign business and securities trading turnover also
increased. Higher earnings from trading on the bank's own
account contributed to record operating profits.
    Net interest income rose on firmer interest margins by 16.1
mln marks to 381.6 mln. Net commission income rose 6.6 mln to
156.7 mln, Luckey said.
    Foreign commercial business was influenced by a fall in
West German foreign trade but earnings were still satisfactory.
    The bank's exposure in Latin America was less than two pct
of its total foreign credit and in Africa less than one pct.
    The bank continued to sell some of its exposure in 1986,
and will also continue to stock up risk provisions, he said.

    David Murdock, chairman and chief executive officer, said,
"Both our food business and our real estate operations
increased their earnings during the year (1986)."
    But, he added that Flexi-Van's 1986 results were hit by
depressed daily rental rates for leased equipment caused by

    The company also reported that George Elkas, formerly

    In conjunction with the stock split proposal, the

dividend of 46 cts a share on the present common, seven pct
higher than the current rate.
    The company said it had increased the dividend by 13 pct

 ]]></BODY><BODY><![CDATA[General Motors Corp staged an explosive
rally on Wall Street after a share buyback program announced
yesterday, but analysts said GM's future remains clouded by
stiff competition and erosion of market share.
    GM shares rose 3-1/2 to 79-1/8 in active trading. Analysts
agreed that investors liked the repurchase program but they 
differed sharply over the carmaker's long term prospects.
    "I'm very positive on GM," said Jack Kirnan of Kidder
Peabody and Co. "They're clearly committed to enhancing
shareholder value."
    However, some analysts worry about how GM will pay for the
buyback and whether new models will enable the carmaker to
recapture lost market share.
    After the market had closed yesterday, GM said it would buy
back 20 pct of its common stock by the end of 1990. The
announcement sent investors today scrambling for GM shares,
with more than 3.2 mln shares changing hands by mid-day.
    The buyback plan caused several analysts bullish on the
stock to reiterate buy recommendations this morning, and at
least one increased his earnings estimates for GM based on a
good performance expected from new car models.
    But David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc said the
repurchase program is not a positive.
    "The buyback doesn't really change the earnings outlook and
puts more stress on the balance sheet," he said, since GM will
have to borrow money to pay for the stock purchases. The stock
should settle back down to around 76, he added.
    Healy projects GM will earn five dlrs a share in 1987 and
5.50 dlrs in 1988, compared to 1986 earnings of 8.21 dlrs.
Healy's numbers are near the low end of Wall Street estimates,
which range from five dlrs to 7.80 dlrs in 1987 and from four
dlrs to 10.80 dlrs in 1988.
    Like other analysts, Healy sees GM's share of the domestic
car and truck market falling in 1987. "On balance, GM cars are
not selling as well as their competitors," he said.
    In late February, GM car sales fell 8.6 pct from the
year-ago period while competitors Ford Motor Co <F> and
Chrysler Corp <C> both posted increases. But GM said February
sales showed improvement over January, adding that it expects
improvement in coming months.
    Overall, GM's share of U.S. car and truck sales should fall
to around 38 or 39 pct in 1987 from 41 pct at the end of 1986,
analysts said. The numbers include imports.
    Kidder Peabody's Kirnan said cost reductions and product
improvements this year should lead to positive cash flow by the
fourth quarter, which will help GM finance the buyback.
    "GM (stock) has been a real laggard and now it's rolling up
its sleeves and getting serious. I think there's a major
earnings surprise in the winds," he said.
    Kirnan raised his earnings estimates slightly today, in
part in reaction to the announced buyback, and sees GM earning
5.65 dlrs this year and 9.75 dlrs in 1988. "The company is more
concerned than ever about improving their relative valuation
with respect to Ford and Chrysler," he said.
    Another positive for the stock is GM's dividend, currently
five dlrs a share annually, which gives it a higher yield than
its competitors, Kirnan said. And GM will raise the cash
dividend 25 to 50 cts a share next year, he predicted.
    But analyst Michael Lucky of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc
said U.S. car sales will weaken, and GM's new products, if
successful, will only slow but not halt the erosion of its
market share.
    "I believe their new cars will be successful, but that will
only curtail losses in market share," which will fall to around
35 pct by 1990, Lucky said.
    Philip Fricke of Goldman Sachs and Co falls in the middle
of the bulls and bears. While he is recommending GM stock, he
said results will not improve until 1988.
    "I'm not looking for improvement this year. This is a
transition year for GM," he said.
    Fricke, who estimates 1987 earnings at 7.80 dlrs and 1988
at 10.80 dlrs, said cost cutting and new car models will not
affect 1987 results. "But the key thing isn't so much what they
earn this year. It's the momentum beyond this year that's
important."

Petroles <TPN.PA> is still expecting a 1.5 billion franc
consolidated net loss, including minority interests, for 1986,
after taking account of stock losses of 7.5 billion francs, the
company said in a communique after a board meeting here.
    In late January group president Francois-Xavier Ortoli told
journalists that the slump in oil prices and the weak dollar
had caused the stock depreciation, turning a consolidated net
profit, before losses on stocks, of six billion francs into a
consolidated net loss of 1.5 billion francs.
    Earlier today Armand Guilbaud, president of Total's
refining and distribution subsidiary Cie de
Raffinage-Distribution (CRD) Total France <RAFF.PA>, told
journalists that 1986 had marked a return to profit for the
subsidiary before stock depreciation.
    CRD made a net profit before stock depreciation and
currency factors of 1.95 billion francs last year after a 1.16
billion loss in 1985.
    But its net loss last year, taking account of that
depreciation as well as currency fluctuations, was 1.16 billion
francs after a 1.05 billion loss in 1985.
    In 1986 CRD's sales fell 5.7 pct to 19.7 mln tonnes from
20.9 mln "due to the growth in imports by independent
distributors following a relaxation of regulations," Guilbaud
said.
    The subsidiary is expecting to cut its workforce to 6,000
this year and 5,000 in 1988 from 6,800 last year, under a job
reduction scheme which will eventually save the group 600 mln
francs, he said.
    Concerning business in 1987, he said that "January was a
good month, but the situation deteriorated in February."

Guinn told a meeting of security analysts that the company sees
continued earnings growth in 1987 above the 1.08 billion dlrs,
or 5.02 dlrs per share, earned in 1986.
    Guinn also said that capital spending stood at about 1.8
billion dlrs in 1986, and the company expected the figure to
remain flat each year through 1989. He noted that all captial
spending will be internally financed.
    Guinn also told analysts that the company faced some
regulatory uncertainties in ongoing rate cases at its Pacific
Bell operating company.
    In rates hearings before, the California Public Utility
Commission, Guinn said the company faced a potential 76 mln dlr
revenue reduction, and due to ongoing discussions with the
commission, he said the figure might even be greater.
    The company also faces some opposition to a 225 mln dlr
rate hike requested for 1986. Guinn said the commission found
180 mln dlrs of the hike was based on questionable calculations
and assumptions, while 45 mln dlrs might represented unneeded
modernization costs.
    Guinn also said that the company is still studying whether
to join an international consortium that plans to lay a
transpacific telephone cable between the U.S. and Japan.
    "We have not agreed to anything," Guinn said, but added he
would soon recieve a feasibility study on the venture and the
company would make a decision soon on participating.
    Asked by an analyst about the recent recommendation by the
U.S. Department of Justice which would allow the Bell operating
companies to offer limited long distance services, Guinn said
the company would likely shy away from that type of expansion.
    "(Long distance services) is a very competitive business.
It's a commodity business and becoming more so," he said. "I'm
not so sure we would be interested in getting back into that
business."
    However, Guinn generally applauded the U.S.
recommendations, saying they would give more latitude for the
Bell operating companies to expand into non-regulated
businesses and provide more flexibility to form strategic
alliances with other companies.
    He added that while the company welcomes the expansion into
new areas, it is not currently involved in any acqusition
talks. "We do not have anything actively under consideration,"
he said.

<HKBH.HK> is likely to show a rise in profit of between 10 and
13 pct for 1986, reflecting stronger than expected loan growth,
share analysts polled by Reuters said.
    Their estimates of the bank's net earnings for last year
ranged from 2.99 to 3.1 billion H.K. Dlrs. Results will be
announced on Tuesday. The 1985 net profit was 2.72 billion.
    They forecast a final dividend of 29 cents for a total of
42 cents for the year against 38 cents in 1985, adjusted for a
one-for-five bonus issue.
    Analysts said they expected the bank to recommend a bonus
issue this year, probably one for three or one for five.
    The bank's 61.5 pct subsidiary Hang Seng Bank Ltd <HSGH.HK>
is to report its 1986 results on Friday.
    Analysts expect Hang Seng to announce net profit of more
than one billion dlrs for the first time, an increase of 10 to
12 pct.
    They expect Hang Seng to pay a final dividend of 1.37 dlrs
for a total of 1.75 dlrs for the year against 1.60 in 1985.
    Analysts said that while the use of undisclosed inner
reserves by banks here makes forecasting very imprecise,
Hongkong Bank benefited from the unexpected strength of the
Hong Kong economy in 1986, when gross domestic product grew by
nearly nine pct against an initial forecast of 4.5 pct.
    "They benefited considerably from the pickup in loan demand,
as their loan portfolio is well balanced," an analyst at Mansion
House Securities (F.E.) Ltd said.
    Government figures show that total loans and advances rose
by 13.8 pct in 1986, compared with a 4.5 pct increase in 1985.
    Loans to finance Hong Kong's visible trade, the mainstay of
the local economy, rose by 15.1 pct against a decline of five
pct in 1985.
    Low interest rates also helped the bank. Interest received
on loans was low, with the prime rate at 6.5 pct at end-1986,
but interest paid on savings was two pct. Hongkong Bank and
Hang Seng Bank control half of all deposits in the banking
system, giving them access to a large base of low-cost funds.
    The strength of the real-estate market was another major
income source for the bank group. Loans to finance property
development and instalment mortgages rose sharply.
    "The Hongkong Bank group is still the leader in mortgage
business despite tough competition from the Bank of China group
and other foreign banks," one analyst said.
    The high level of activity on the capital and equities
markets in 1986 contributed to a sharp improvement in Hongkong
Bank subsidiaries Wardley Ltd <WAIA.HK> and <James Capel and
Co>, analysts said. "Wardley had a tremendous year acting as
financial adviser and underwriter," an analyst said.
    Wardley was underwriter for last year's billion-dlr
flotation of <Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd>, of which Hongkong
Bank owned 30 pct at the time.
    The bank's stake has since been cut to 16.4 pct in return
for 1.57 billion dlrs. It also sold its entire 48.8 pct stake
in <South China Morning Post Ltd>, the larger of two
English-language daily newspapers here, for 1.18 billion dlrs.
    The proceeds will go to reserves for acquisitions and will
not show up in the profit and loss accounts, analysts said.
    Analysts said the bank had also been helped by a reduced
need to write off bad debts. "The need for provisions was much
lower than the year before," said Tony Measor of Hong Leong
Securities Co Ltd. "Last year's profits should have been 2.8 to
2.9 billion dlrs if not for the huge provisions."
    Former Hongkong Bank chairman Michael Sandberg said the
bank wrote off hundreds of millions of dollars against its
shipping exposure in 1985. Lesley Nickolds of County Securities
Asia Ltd said she saw no major shipping writeoffs in 1986. She
forecast profit of 2.99 billion dlrs.
    The bank's Latin American exposure, mainly through its
51-pct owned Marine Midland Banks Inc <MM>, appears to have
improved substantially, analysts said. Marine Midland's 1986
fourth-quarter loan-loss provisions fell to 44.1 mln U.S. Dlrs
from 89.2 mln a year before. Its 1986 net profit rose to 145
mln U.S. Dlrs from 125 mln in 1985.

 ]]></BODY><BODY><![CDATA[Jaguar Plc <JAGR.L> is about to sell its
new XJ-6 model on the U.S. And Japanese markets and expects a
strong reception based on its success in the U.K., Chairman Sir
John Egan told a news conference.
    Commenting on an 11 pct growth in 1986 group turnover to
830.4 mln stg and pre-tax profits at 120.8 mln stg, slightly
below 1985's 121.3 mln, Egan said Jaguar aimed at an average
profit growth of 15 pct per year. However, the introduction of
the new model had kept this year's pre-tax profit down.
    Jaguar starts selling XJ-6 in the U.S. In May and plans to
sell 25,000 of its total 47,000 production there in 1987.
    U.S. Sales now account for 65 pct of total turnover,
finance director John Edwards said.
    A U.S. Price for the car has not been set yet, but Edwards
said the relatively high car prices in dollars of West German
competitors offered an "umbrella" for Jaguar. He added the XJ-6
had also to compete with U.S. Luxury car producers which would
restrict the car's price.
    Jaguar hedges a majority of its dollar receipts on a
12-month rolling basis and plans to do so for a larger part of
its receipts for longer periods, John Egan said.
    In the longer term, capital expenditure will amount to 10
pct of net sales. Research and development will cost four pct
of net sales and training two pct.
    Jaguar builds half of its cars and buys components for the
other half. The firm is in early stages of considering the
building of an own press shop in Britain for about 80 mln stg,
but Egan said this would take at least another three years
    On the London Stock Exchange, Jaguar's shares were last
quoted at 591p, down from 611p at yesterday's close, after
reporting 1986 results which were in line with market
expectations, dealers said.

a reiterated recommendation by Merrill Lynch and Co that
focused on strong earnings momentum for the company, traders
said.
    "We have been recommending the stock since it was in the
50s, but we reiterated today because of expectations of strong
earnings momentum, its benefits from the lower dollar and
anticipation of nice gains in margins," Merrill Lynch
analyst Charles Ryan said. He said a negative opinion by
another brokerage house hurt the stock Wednesday, and it can be
bought at a relatively bargain price today.
    Ryan said "you always have to look at Polaroid at its
weakness. Its a volatile stock that has to be caught on
weakness." Polaroid's stock, which gained more than a point
early this morning, was trading at 76-1/8, up 5/8. It was down
over three points Wednesday morning before closing down 7/8.
    "Polaroid is working overtime on production of cameras and
film, so we expect first quarter earnings to be up about 40

Bert Roberts said he expects MCI's financial performance to
improve in the current quarter compared to the previous
quarter.
    He said American Telephone and Telegraph Co long-distance
rate cuts had cut into MCI's fourth quarter performance but
added: "There's going to be a continuing impact (on profits) but
we expect this quarter to be better than the fourth quarter."
    The current quarter ends March 31.
    For the fourth quarter, MCI reported a 448 mln dlr loss,
due mainly to write-offs and staff reductions.
    Roberts said the ATT long-distance rate reductions, which
had been ordered by the Federal Communications Commission have
had "A significantly negative impact on our profits."
    As reported earlier today, MCI said it plans to ask the FCC
to immediately deregulate ATT, apparently in hopes that an
unregulated ATT would pocket a greater proportion of its
revenues rather than cut rates further.

earlier reporting higher net income for the first quarter ended
January 31, said it expects loan losses to be lower than last
year's 697.0 mln dlrs.
    However, the bank said it will maintain the high level of
provisioning for loan losses established last year because of
many market uncertainties. Commerce bank set loan loss
provisions of 636.0 mln dlrs in fiscal 1986, ended October 31.
    The bank earlier said first quarter net income rose to 96.5
mln dlrs from 87.0 mln dlrs in the prior year. Profit per basic
share after dividends fell to 61 cts from year-ago 64 cts.
    Commerce Bank said because of market uncertainties, it used
an estimate of 600.0 mln dlrs for fiscal 1987 loan losses in
calculating first quarter results.
    The bank's first quarter provision for loan losses rose to
172.0 mln dlrs, from 152.0 mln dlrs in the prior year.
    Commerce Bank also said it will continue to adopt an
agressive posture in adding to its general provisions against
loan exposure to 34 countries designated by the federal
government's Inspector General of Banks.
    First quarter net partly benefitted from net interest
income, up to 561.8 mln dlrs from year ago 540.9 mln dlrs.
    Commerce Bank said improved other income, which rose to
213.6 mln dlrs from year-earlier 170.1 mln dlrs, and net income
was partially offset by the increased loan loss provisions,
non-interest expenses and income taxes.
    The bank said first quarter total assets increased to 83.92
billion dlrs from 78.93 mln dlrs in the prior year, due mainly
to continued expansion in consumer loan and mortgage fields.
    Return on assets increased by two cts to 46 cts per 100
dlrs of average assets from the first quarter in fiscal 1986,
but declined two cts from fiscal 1986 fourth quarter.
    The bank also said total non-accrual loans increased to 2.4
billion dlrs in the first quarter from year-ago 1.8 billion
dlrs. However, non-accrual loans declined 130 mln dlrs from
fiscal 1986 year-end.
    "Despite the recent announcement of the suspension of
interest payments by Brazil, virtually all of the bank's loans
to this country were income producing up to January 31, 1987,
and there was little adverse impact on the bank's earnings
prior to the announcement," Commerce bank said.
    The bank did not disclose a forecast of the impact on
future earnings by Brazil's suspension of interest payments.

expects earnings from its pharmaceuticals operations to grow  
to about 35 pct of world profits within the next five years
compared with a current 30 pct, chairman elect Denys Henderson
told financial analysts.
    "Over the next five years we expect to launch one major new
product each year," Henderson said.
    He also said research and development spending in this
business segment will be increased to 14 pct of total sales
income in 1987 from 13 pct, or 130 mln sterling, in 1986.
    ICI, the world's fifth largest chemicals firm in terms of
sales, recently reported 1986 profits of about 888 mln dlrs on
15 billion dlrs in sales, compared with income of 817 mln dlrs
on 15.87 billion dlrs in sales a year earlier.
    Sales in the United States totaled about three billion
dlrs, ICI executives said.
    In addition, Henderson said overall corporate growth will
come from ICI's research and development activities, but the
company intends to continue to grow through an acquisition
program.
    ICI spent just under one billion dlrs for acquisitions
during 1986, the largest of which was the 580 mln dlr purchase
of Cleveland, Ohio-based Glidden Inc, a paints, resins and
coatings company, from <Hanson Trust PLC>.
    ICI financial director Alan Clements said the company's
borrowing limits are at a level of about 6.3 billion sterling,
1.5 billion of which have already been used.
    While the company has no current plans for a major
acquisition, "we are ready to move quickly in the acquisition
field if the need arises," Clements said.

higher earnings and revenues in its second fiscal quarter
ending March 31 against a year ago.
    "We feel we will continue to see higher growth in the
quarter," James Treybig, president and and chief executive
officer, told a meeting of securities analysts.
    In the second fiscal quarter last year, Tandem earned
9,950,000 dlrs or 29 cts per share on revenues of 176.3 mln
dlrs.
    Treybig declined to offer specific projections for the
quarter but he said the results might be lower than those for
the first quarter of fiscal 1987, when Tandem earned 27.1 mln
dlrs or 58 cts a share. He said Tandem's second quarter is
traditionally slower than the first.
    L.F. Rothschild Unterberg Towbin analyst Frederic Cohen
estimated Tandem's second quarter net at 40 to 45 cts per
share. For the full year, he said he expects the computer maker
to earn about 2.40 dlrs a share. In fiscal 1986, Tandem earned
1.44 dlrs a share.
    Treybig, who founded the Cupertino, Calif.-based company,
said he has seen a rebound in computer orders in the United
States. "The U.S. economy is picking up, and buying decisions
are being made. We didn't see that a year ago," he said.
    The executive said Tandem will increase its research and
development spending to about 100 mln dlrs this year from 87
mln dlrs in fiscal 1986.
    He said the company plans to introduce several products,
including two low-end systems and a data base that uses the SQL
programming language, an industry standard. Tandem also won a

long term debt was 3.06 billion dlrs compared to 1.71 billion
dlrs in 1985.
    The company released its audited 1986 results.
    The company also said its long term debt was reduced by
about 1.5 billion dlrs from the third quarter to the end of the
year by asset sales and equity offerings. Union Carbide sold
its battery products, home and automobile products and
agricultural products businesses in 1986. In the fourth
quarter, it offered 30 mln shares of stock, raising about 650
mln dlrs.
    The asset sales and equity offering were part of a
recapitalization plan undertaken by the chemicals company last
year.
    Audited net earnings in 1986 of 496 mln dlrs or 4.78 dlrs a
share compared to a 1985 loss of 581 mln dlrs or 2.78 dlrs were
unchanged from the company's preliminary earnings report made
on Jan 28. The earnings results for the fourth quarter were
also unchanged.
    Included in the 1986 numbers are a 564 mln dlr gain from
sale of the different businesses, a 270 mln dlr pension credit
and a charge of 473 mln dlrs from the purchase of long term
debt at a premium under the recapitalization.
    In the audited results released today, the company broke
down results by business segment.
    Operating profit in the fourth quarter for all of the
company's operations on a consolidated basis, before corporate
and interest expense and taxes, was 181 mln dlrs against a loss
of three mln dlrs in the 1985 quarter.
    In the year, operating profit was 791 mln dlrs compared to
a loss of 253 mln dlrs in 1985.
    In a statement, the company said it defeated a hostile
takeover attempt, by GAF Corp <GAF>, and recapitalized the
company, adding, "While all this was going on, our continuing
businesses performed very soundly, with substantial operating
profit improvement over 1985."
    Carbon products posted operating profit of eight mln dlrs
in the quarter, down from 29 mln dlrs, and 49 mln dlrs in the
year against a loss of 146 mln dlrs.
    Chemicals and plastics had fourth quarter operating profit
of 122 mln dlrs compared to a year-ago loss of 49 mln dlrs. In
the year, chemicals and plastics earned 472 mln dlrs against
losses of 142 mln dlrs in 1985.
    Operating income at industrial gases rose to 64 mln dlrs
from 55 mln in the quarter and to 276 mln dlrs from 222 mln in
the year.
    The company's specialties and services segment cut its
losses in the quarter to 13 mln dlrs from 40 mln dlrs and in
the year to three mln dlrs from 181 mln dlrs.
    Eliminations of business conducted between the company's
industry segments contributed two mln dlrs to fourth quarter
1985 profits but did not affect the 1986 quarter. The
eliminations caused losses of three mln dlrs compared to six
mln dlrs in the year.
    The 1985 operating results include a host of unusual
writeoffs and depreciation charges totaling 134 mln dlrs in the
quarter and 906 mln dlrs in the year.
    Capital expenditures rose to 524 mln dlrs in 1986 from 501
mln dlrs.
    By segment, spending at carbon products fell to 42 mln dlrs
from 57 mln dlrs and spending fell at specialties and services
to 126 mln dlrs from 143 mln dlrs.
    At chemicals and plastics, expenditures rose to 147 mln
dlrs from 133 mln and at industrial gases they rose to 209 mln
dlrs from 168 mln dlrs.
    The company's cash and equivalents fell to 299 mln dlrs at

sharply lower 1986 profit, said it anticipated solid profit and
revenue growth during the next five years.
    "Looking to the longer term, Spar is confident that its
continuing concentration on advanced robotics, satellite-based
communications and electro-optical defense systems will lead to
significant growth in revenues and earnings over the next five
years," the company said.
    It also forecast higher 1987 sales due to an increased
order backlog. Revenues last year fell to 191 mln dlrs from
223.3 mln while profit fell to 4.4 mln dlrs from 13.1 mln.
    Spar added that lower development costs in the
communications group and a return to normal operations in gears
and transmissions and aviation services "will remove a serious
drain on profits" this year.
    It attributed its reduced 1986 earnings to communications
group losses resulting from continued heavy investment in new
products and market development, a four-month strike at its
Toronto plants and delays in receipt of authorization from
customers to start work on new programs.

to criminal charges of conspiracy to defraud the Social
Security Administration and agreed to pay 1.2 mln dlrs in fines
and costs to the U.S. Government.
    The company also reached agreements in principle for an 8.1
mln dlr settlement of class action law suits.
    About 2.9 mln dlrs of the class action settlement will be
provided by Paradyne's insurance carrier. The settlement is
contingent on court approval after notice to class members, it
said.
     The criminal case settlement dismisses all charges
including bribery and false statement, except for conspiracy to
which Paradyne pleaded guilty.
    The criminal settlement includes the lifting of the
government's suspension, the dismissal of the federal civil
false claims suit and all charges against the individuals.
    Of the 2.9 mln dlrs the insurance carrier will provide for
the civil settlement, 750,000 dlrs will go to settle a
derivative lawsuit.
    For the year ended December 31, Paradyne reported a net
loss of 38.5 mln dlrs. The year-end results include an 8.0 mln
dlrs provision for future legal and or settlement costs to
cover the civil and criminal settlements announced today.
    Paradyne also said it named Jerry Kendall as president and
chief executive officer, succeeding Robert Wiggins who resigned
as chairman and chief executive officer as part of the
settlement of the indictment.
    Kendall formerly served as executive vice president and
chief operating officer.
    The company also said that due to the sluggish marketplace,
it does not expect to be profitable in the first quarter but is
optimistic about the outlook for the year.
    For the first quarter of 1986, the company reported net
income of 875,000 dlrs on sales of 66.0 mln dlrs.
    Wiggins was among five Paradyine executives who were
charged along with three former officers in a 1985 federal
indictment stemming from a 115 mln contract awarded to Paradyne
in 1981 to build a computer network for the Social Security
Administration.
    The men were accused of conspiring to bribe government
officials and defaud the Social Security Administration.
Wiggins and other defendants were also charged with providing
false testimony and obstructing justice during a Securities and
Exchange Commission investigation.
 
   Under the settlement announced today, federal prosecutors
agreed to defer all charges against Wiggins and three other
defendants under a one-year pretrial agreement.
    The charges would then be dropped if the defendants
successfully complete the probation period. Details of the
requirements in the agreement were not immediately available.

    Viner said its brokerage subsidiary, Edward A. Viner and Co

    The company said Heck's Chapter 11 filing could, however,

     It said it and the Toussie-Viner group, with which it made
the merger offer, were assessing their options regarding the
Heck's investment.
    Viner earlier reported a fourth quarter loss of 918,000
U.S. dlrs after a 1.5 mln dlr writedown of its stake in Heck's.
It earned 585,000 dlrs in the previous fourth quarter.

said its property-casualty companies had a net loss of 56 mln

mln dlrs.
    Nationwide said its property-casualty group, the
fourth-largest U.S. property-casualty insurer had a 106 mln dlr
loss in 1986. Nationwide Life Insurance Co earned 62.8 mln dlrs
in 1985, with last year's profit including record capital gains
of 14.4 mln dlrs, up from gains of 2.6 mln dlrs the previous
year.
    The company said its property-casualty group had a record
loss from insurance operations last year of 859 mln dlrs after
policyholders' dividends, up 25 pct from 1985's 710 mln dlrs.
    Nationwide said a surge in claims from personal auto
insurance and the volatile commercial liability coverages
during a period of unprecedented sales growth generated the
loss.
    The company said over 576 mln dlrs of last year's group
losses came from commercial insurance lines and 282 mln dlrs
from its personal auto insurance business.
    Partially offsetting 1986's record insurance losses,
Nationwide said, were record investment gains of 775 mln dlrs
and a 28 mln dlr federal tax credit. The investment gains were
up 39 pct from 1985's gains of 559 mln dlrs.

chairman Robertus Hazelhoff said the bank's 10.3 pct increase
in net 1986 profit to 527 mln guilders from 478 mln in 1985 was
encouraging in view of the sharply lower dollar.
    Hazelhoff, speaking at a press conference after the release
of ABN's 1986 results, said a sharp decrease in foreign
earnings had been compensated by a strong domestic performance,
notably in the securities business.
    He said the bank was also proposing a one for 10
share-split which should facilitate trade in the bank's stock.
    News of the split sparked a 14 guilder rise in ABN's share
price on the Amsterdam bourse to a close of 517 guilders.
    Prospects for 1987 hung on three uncertainties, namely the
future trend of the dollar, the level of interest rates and
ABN's share of equities trade, Hazelhoff said.
    Provisions for general contingencies were reduced in 1986
by 4.1 pct to 575 mln guilders, while taxes increased by 2.1
pct to 242 mln guilders, he added.
    Lower global interest rates in 1986 had nipped earnings
margins via traditional lending activities, he said.
    Hazelhoff said ABN was unlikely to continue reducing risk
provisions in the future but he noted the bank was not overly
concerned about default by Latin American debtors, a factor
which brokers say has distanced Dutch insititutions from bank
stocks recently.
    He said that of the bank's estimated 25 financially
troubled sovereign debtors, about one quarter were Latin
American countries. These would ultimately pay up, he said.
    He added that losses incurred through loans to tin
producers in the wake of the tin council crisis at end-1985 had
been written off.

 ]]></BODY><BODY><![CDATA[American Telephone and Telegraph Co's
proposal to deregulate its long distance phone service is
unlikely to produce a radical change in phone rates, but it
should help the company's profits, analysts said.
    "Deregulation will mean more pricing discounts for large
volume users, but status quo for residential users," said
PaineWebber Group analyst Jack Grubman.
    But the proposals will scrap the pricing formula that has
constrained the company's profits in the long distance
business, leading to higher profit margins, analysts said.
    ATT has long pushed for deregulation of its long-distance
business, the profits of which have been limited by a regulated
rate-of-return on the company's investments. The rate was cut
last year to 12.20 from 12.75 pct.
    Earlier today the company proposed to the Federal
Communications Commission to scrap the formula, cut the amount
of time needed to approve rate proposals, and leave it up to
its competitors to oppose it filings.
    MCI Communications Corp <MCIC> made a similar filing
yesterday, saying greater the moves would increase competition
in the telephone business.
    Analysts said the proposals will allow ATT to cut costs in
the long-distance unit, and increase its profit margins
previously constrained by the rate of return. But many said
they did not expect the proposals to lead to higher prices in
the industry, simply because of the competition the phone
industry giant faces.
    "You probably wouldn't see as much of a price decline,"
said Gartner Group analyst Fritz Ringling. "But you wouldn't
see a rise." Grubman said the proposals will allow ATT to
selectively raise or lower prices, depending on the market. "It
will give ATT a lot more flexibility," he said.
    ATT now faces a period of comment in which a number of
companies will be able to respond to the proposals in FCC
hearings.
    It may face at least one strong opponent, U.S. Sprint, the
long distance joint venture between GTE Corp <GTE> and United
Telecommunications Inc <UT>.
    "We think the Congress of the FCC should establish a
reasonable rate of return. Someone should establish it," a U.S.
Sprint spokesman said. But he added the company was not opposed
to greater competition.
    It may also take some time for the proposals to go through,
and in the process they may be altered by the various
constituencies affected by the move.
    "There's so much complexity, so much inertia, so much
bureacracy, that stricly speaking about the mechanisms, it
won't happen that fast," said analyst Victor Krueger of the
Gartner Group.

a quarter of its professional and management staff and nearly
half of its direct labor force as part of a restructuring and
downsizing of its business.
    The company also said it will receive a qualified opinion
from the auditors of it 1986 financial statement subject to the
outcome of two suits. The company is a defendant in a
consolidated class action law suit which seeks damages in an
unspecified amount and is also a defendant in a related
shareholder action.
    Iomega said the auditors state in their opinion letter that
both actions are in the early stages of discovery and the
likely outcome can not be determined at this time.
    The company said a corporate wide reduction of its
professional, management and indirect labor will result in the
permanent elimination of 183 positions in all functional areas
of the company's business. This represents over 25 pct of
professional, management and indirect employees, it added.
    In addition, Iomega announced layoff of about 182

after-tax charge of 226 mln dlrs against earnings no later than
January 1988 because the projected cost of the Vogtle nuclear
power plant has risen abover the amount which retail customers
in Georgia will be asked to pay.
    The company's largest subsidiary, Georgia Power Co, said
the budget for the plant has increased by 6.3 pct, or 522 mln
dlrs, to 8.87 billion. However, because of a pledge the made
last year to Georgia's Public Service Commission, the increased
cost will not be included in the utility's retail electric
rates.
    Geogia Power also said its board has delayed the scheduled
completion of Vogtle's Unit Two to June 1989 from September
1988. Unit Two is about 60 pct complete, it added.
    The utility said fuel loading has been completed at Unit
One and the unit is being put through a series of low-power
tests before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is asked for a
full-power license.
    The nuclear power plant, located near Waynesboro, Ga., is
co-owned by <Oglethorpe Power Corp>, the Municipal Electric
Authority of Georgia and the city of Dalton.
    Georgia Power said the revised Vogtle budget estimate was
due to several factors, including additional labor costs
incurred to keep the plant's first unit on schedule for
commercial operation by June. The new figure represents the
first change in the plant's budget since August 1985, when it
was estimated at 8.35 billion dlrs.
    In March 1986, the utility told Georgia regulators it would
"cap" the price of Vogtle its customers would be asked to pay
at 3.56 billion dlrs, the company's share of the then projected
8.35 billion dlr total. Under the new budget, Georgia Power
said, its share amounts to 3.87 billion dlrs.
    Noting that Georgia Power's share of the Vogtle increase is
313 mln dlrs, Southern said this will result in a charge
against earnings of 177 mln dlrs after taxes.
    In addition, the company said, Georgia Power's contracts
with the joint owners require the utility to buy back
significant amounts of Vogtle capacity during the plant's
initial years of operation. Under terms of the cap on costs, it
will not attempt to recover the portion of the budget increase
that applies to the buybacks.
    This bings the total amount that must be charged against
earnings to 2326 mln dlrs after taxes, Southern said.
    Southern said new rules of the Financial Accounting
Standards Board, which are effective in January 1988, require
any costs that are determined nonrecoverable to be charged
against earnings once that determination is made.
    The company also said its board has approved a capital
budget of 2.1 billion dlrs in 1987, including work on the
Vogtle project.
    It said a 5.9 billion dlr capita budget for the three-year
period 1987-1989 was also outlined at the board meeting, noting
this is 700 mln dlrs below the comparable figure for the years
1986-1988.

of Lloyds Bank PLC <LLOY.L>, said it intends to redeem all
existing preferred shares and distribute a stock dividend to
common shareholders.
    The initial distribution will be in cumulative redeemable
retractable floating rate class A preferred shares series II,
which will carry a retraction right enabling holders to receive
12.75 dlrs for each share.
    Continental said the 58.6 mln dlrs of existing outstanding
preferred shares will be paid off at par plus accrued dividends.
     Continental said the notes will carry a dividend rate of
72 pct of prime and it expects that the shares will trade at
12.75 dlrs or more, enabling shareholders who wish to receive
cash to do so.
    The bank said it expects the distribution will be made in
early May, subject to various approvals.
    Continental also said that, as of March 2, it had cash of
more than 250 mln dlrs and equity of about 284.6 mln dlrs,
allowing for a final total distribution of 16.60 dlrs per
common share.
    Continental Bank said it continues to expect that the final
distribution to shareholders will be in the range of 16.50 dlrs
to 17.25 dlrs per share and will take place in late 1988 or
early 1989.
    Until the initial stock distribution takes place, regular
dividend payments will be maintained on the existing preferred
shares, the bank said.
    The distribution is part of the terms of Continental Bank
of Canada's sale of its banking assets to Lloyds Bank Canada, a
subsidiary of Lloyds Bank PLC.
    Continental Bank said Lloyds Bank Canada paid the balance
of the purchase price but that it was lower than originally
anticipated since Continental was unable to transfer certain
income tax deductions to Lloyds Bank. Continental did not give
further details.

Corp, which had offered to buy the shares of CTS that it did
not already own.
    CTS made a profit of 7.9 mln dlrs from continuing
operations in 1985.
    CTS said it charged an additional 2.8 mln dlrs in special
expenses to its 1986 operations as a result of the Dynamics
Corp settlement.
    The additional expenses include the obligation to reimburse
Dynamics Corp, subject to approval of CTS shareholders, a total
of 2.1 mln dlrs for Dynamics Corp's expenses and other costs
relating to CTS.

early results for 1987 were encouraging, and the combination of
its investment and acquisition strategies enabled it to look
forward confidently for an excellent result for the year.
    The company was commenting on 1986 results which showed
pre-tax profit rising to 54.9 mln stg from 33.4 mln previously
on turnover that lifted to 1.70 billion from 1.13 billion.
    The figures initially boosted the share price to 286p from
281p last night, but they then eased back to 283p by 0830 GMT.
    Hillsdown said capital expenditure rose in 1986 to 60 mln
stg from 31.5 mln and would continue at this high level in
1987.
    The placing of 82.5 mln shares last year raised 160.7 mln
stg and enabled shareholders' funds to more than double to 352
mln at year-end.
    Net borrowings were 20 pct of shareholder's funds and the
group had listed investments of 47.1 mln.
    The company said it had bought a total of 40 companies
during the year for a total price of some 180 mln stg. Although
these had made minor contribution to profits the real benefits
would come in 1988 and beyond.

    Takeuchi said sales are expected to fall 40 pct to 1,700

year's fall was due to lower selling prices for end-users,
which more than offset the yen's appreciation. The company will

 ]]></BODY><BODY><![CDATA[Ultramar Plc <UMAR.L> said that while
its fourth 1986 quarter had improved from the operational point
of view, several special charges adversely affected results.
    Overall the year had not been a good one, with upstream
operations dramatically hit by the fall in crude oil prices and
downstream operations also affected in the first half by large
losses on inventories.
    But margins improved in the second half and in particular
refining and marketing in Eastern Canada showed a good
recovery.
    The company was commenting on results that showed a net
loss for the year of 62.1 mln stg after a 71.6 mln profit in
1985.
    The fourth quarter charges included a 20.8 mln stg
provision on a retroactive price agreement recently initialled
by Pertamina and Japanese buyers of the company's liquid
natural gas and 4.7 mln for the early months of its ownership
of Gulf Canada's marketing assets.
    Ultramar said it had also included the estimated cost of a
further reorganisation programme, which was partly offset by a
withdrawal of surplus funds from U.S. Pension schemes, and a
13.5 mln stg provision for the estimated cost of selling its
U.S. Flag shipping operation.
    The immediate outlook for crude oil prices was uncertain
although it was unlikely there would be any sizeable increase
in the near term. However, Ultramar said it was optimistic
prices would strengthen over the longer term.
    Its substantial reserves of crude oil and natural gas put
it in a good position to benefit from any price recovery.
    In the meantime, Ultramar's objectives were to improve
profitability by selling or restructuring weak operations while
strengthening core businesses and developing a sound
operational and financial base.
    Proven, probable and possible reserves at end-1986 totalled
about 700 mln barrels net on an oil-equivalent basis.
    Ultramar shares firmed on the announcement to 187p from
181p at last night's close.

AG <PRSG.F> said it was not yet certain whether the company
would pay a dividend on 1986 results
    He was commenting on a Preussag statement which said
results in 1986 were lower than in 1985. Preussag has
frequently said its results came under further pressure in 1986
following a difficult year in 1985.
    Managing board chairman Guenther Sassmannshausen said in
December the board would prefer to stick to its policy of not
dipping into reserves to pay dividends. The spokesman noted the
final dividend decision rests with the supervisory board.
    The Preussag statement said results fell in 1986 compared
with 1985 because declines in earnings in metals, oil and
shipping were not entirely compensated by positive trends in
the group's other divisions.
    The spokesman said it was not clear whether the domestic
group would show a net profit in 1986, adding this would depend
partly on the level of provisions.
    Preussag cut its 1985 dividend to eight marks from nine
marks on 1984 results after parent company net profit dropped
to 65.0 mln marks from 103.0 mln the year before.
    The Preussag world group made a net loss of 13.1 mln marks
in 1985 after a net profit of 154.5 mln the year before.
Domestic group net profit fell to 77.9 mln from 122.2 mln.
    The statement said its results in 1986 were affected by
unsatisfactory selling prices for metals and oil as well as by
poor use of capacity in the supply ship sector.
    The reduction in natural gas prices in the fourth quarter
of 1986 to reflect earlier falls in oil prices was an
additional factor behind the drop in results.
    Preussag said rationalization measures already introduced
would not begin to take full effect until this year.
    Preussag's domestic group turnover rose to 4.48 billion
marks in 1986 from 4.29 billion in 1985, helped by the first
time consolidation of 951.8 mln marks of turnover from its
majority-owned oil and gas subsidiary C. Deilmann AG.
    Domestic group turnover in the 1986 fourth quarter alone
was 1.1 billion marks, it said without giving comparison
figures.
    Preussag said its domestic crude oil production fell 4.0
pct to 94,400 tonnes in 1986, while foreign oil production rose
to 182,900 tonnes from 174,500 tonnes.
    Preussag said its Amalgamated Metal Corporation Plc (AMC)
subsidiary, whose results are included in the world group
accounts, made an unspecified profit in the fourth quarter of
last year.
    AMC's large losses in 1985, caused principally by the
international tin crisis, were the reason behind the world
group losses that year.

 ]]></BODY><BODY><![CDATA[Creditanstalt-Bankverein <CABV.VI> is
likely to raise its 1987 dividend from the 1986 payment of 12
pct of share capital, deputy general-director Guido
Schmidt-Chiari said.
    The 1985 dividend was 10 pct, unchanged from the previous
year and Schmidt-Chiari noted that the parent bank's share
capital had risen to 3.1 billion schillings at the end of 1986
from 2.7 billion a year earlier.
    Schmidt-Chiari made the forecast at a news conference when
the bank announced a 1986 consolidated banking group net profit
of 496.7 mln schillings for 1986, against 354.5 mln in 1985.
    Schmidt-Chiari did not elaborate on his dividend forecast.
    The banking group's consolidated balance sheet total rose
to 453.4 billion schillings at year-end from 425.4 billion.
    General director Hannes Androsch said higher investment
would lead to continuing growth in profits in future. Last
year's better profits had resulted from improvements in
services provided by the bank and also in profits on schilling
lending.
    Schilling lending had grown last year and interest rate
margins had also improved but remained unsatisfactory when
compared with those in other countries, he said.
    Increased provisions for possible bad debts at home and
abroad, particularly in Latin America, had lowered profits,
Androsch said, but declined to give an exact figure.
    Schmidt-Chiari said that foreign lending business had
fallen significantly due to exchange rate fluctuations,
removing some 22 billion schillings from the balance sheet
total.
    In an attempt to generate more foreign business,
representative offices would be opened this year in Tokyo, Hong
Kong, Moscow and Prague. Androsch welcomed government plans to
abolish legal controls on foreigners buying voting shares and
drawing dividends.
    Preference shares of state-controlled Creditanstalt rose
eight schillings on the Vienna Bourse today to 2,008. Brokers
said improved results had been widely expected by investors.
    Androsch said industrial holdings had performed better in
1986 than in previous years, giving a return on investment of
2.6 pct compared with 1.3 pct in 1985. Creditanstalt, Austria's
largest bank, holds majority interests in 10 medium-sized and
large Austrian companies.
    But he forecast its biggest industrial subsidiary, Steyr
-Daimler-Puch AG <SDPV.VI> would return a 1987 result similar
to the expected 1986 operating loss of 700 mln schillings.

producer Novo Industri A/S (NVO.CO) said pre-tax earnings fell
almost 10 pct in 1986 though sales rose by two pct.
    The pre-tax figure fell to 788 mln crowns from 872 mln in
1985, on sales increased from 4.1 billion to 4.2 billion,
giving net earnings of 521 mln crowns against 604 mln in 1985.
    Earnings per 20-crown share went from 23.79 crowns to 20.45
crowns but the company proposed an unchanged 20 pct dividend.
    "Foreign exchange fluctuations in 1986 were a very
significant factor behind developments in the result before and
after tax," Novo said in a statement.
    "Not only the U.S. Dollar but also other currencies
essential to Novo fell in 1986 in relation to the Danish crown,"
the statement added.
    In November 1986, Novo purchased 75 pct of shares in A/S
Ferrosan, which heads a group specialising in research and
development of CNS (central nervous treatment) treatments and
the sale of pharmaceuticals and vitamins in Scandinavia.
    The 357 mln crowns paid in goodwill "had a very limited
effect on the 1986 result," the Novo statement said.

after analyst William Smith of Smith Barney recommended the
stock, based on the company's strong earnings momentum and the
possibility of a stock buyback, dividend hike or stock split,
traders said.
    "I am very impressed with the strong basic earnings story,"
analyst Smith said, noting that the company has "fine tuned its
buying and inventories, and has admirably controlled costs in a
time that they needed to."
    The stock jumped 2-1/2 to 98-3/4.
    Smith said the company ended 1986 with a strong cash
position of about 639 mln dlrs as compared to 158 mln dlrs the
year before. "This implies the possibility of a share buyback,
or significant dividend increase or a stock split," he said.
    In addition, he said the company has been gradually
adjusting its merchandise mix and its gross margins have been
improving.
    Smith expects the company to earn 8.25-to-8.50 dlrs a share
in 1987 as compared to the 7.06 dlrs a share earned last year.
Last year's results include a 69 cent charge for the buyback of
debt.

accumulating recommendations from Shearson Lehman Brothers and
First Boston, traders said.
    Du Pont, which opened with a two point gain, stood at
109-1/8, up 1-1/8.
    First Boston's analyst was not available for comment.
    Analyst Theodore Semegran of Shearson said he raised his
earnings estimates for the company to 7.25 dlrs a share in 1987
and eight dlrs a share in 1988. The company earned 6.35 dlrs a
share in 1986.
    "Good domestic demand, higher operating earnings and a
strng export business, probably benefitting from a lower dollar
and effects of reduced imports in chemicals will continue to
aid Du Pont." He also noted that energy earnings in the first
quarter are better than expected because of the rise in crude
prices. Semegran expects first quarter earnings
of about 1.85 dlrs a share from 1.67 dlrs last year.
    He also expects the company to raise its annual dividend
about 20 to 30 cts a share, from its current dividend of 3.20
dlrs a share, "and a stock split is possible but it has a low
probablility."

Columbia said it revised its estimate of shareholder
distributions from last November's sale of most of the bank's
assets to HongKong Bank of Canada to between 65 cts and 1.15

    The bank said the estimate could rise to between 1.30 dlrs
and 1.80 dlrs a share if the full pension surplus is obtained.
It said it did not know when distributions would be made.
    It earlier reported that operating profit for first quarter
ended January 31 fell to 273,000 dlrs from 1.7 mln dlrs the
previous year.
    For full-year 1986 ended October 31, the bank posted an
operating loss of 4.4 mln dlrs against year-earlier profit of
7.5 mln dlrs. The bank also posted a 66 mln dlr extraordinary

    Bank of British Columbia sold most of its assets last
November to HongKong Bank Canada, a unit of <HongKong and

    It said efforts to wind up the bank's affairs were
proceeding as quickly as possible.
    The bank said it expected to report positive earnings in
future periods, barring unforeseen circumstances.
    Loan losses, which the bank previously said figured in its
move to sell off most of its assets, rose to 105.7 mln dlrs in
fiscal 1986 from year-earlier 36.1 mln dlrs. The bank said 31.1
mln dlrs of the 1986 total represented downward adjustments to
its portfolio of syndicated sovereign risk loans as required
under the sale to HongKong Bank.
    Since November 27, the bank has confined activities to the
winding up of affairs, Bank of British Columbia said.

reporting a further decline in profits for 1986 as increasing
provisions have to be set aside to cover the burden of non-
performing loans.
    Bankers in the Saudi capital said the need to build
reserves for bad and doubtful debts may start to decline a
little this year.
    But the kingdom's still sluggish economy and legal problems
hampering traditional lending operations mean earnings will
remain vulnerable.
    One senior bank credit officer said "The work is largely
done in terms of identifying bad loans and making provisions,
but banks are still going to face difficulties earning money."
    The sudden decline of Saudi Arabia's corporate sector in
1983 - culminating in a number of debt reschedulings - has
taken a heavy toll of bank profits, with first results now
appearing for 1986 showing a fourth successive year of broad
decline.
    The cumulative net 1985 earnings of the kingdom's banks had
sunk to 827.9 mln riyals from 2.66 billion in 1982 before world
oil prices tumbled.
    Of the kingdom's nine joint-venture banks which operate on
the Gregorian calendar year, four have already reported and
revealed a further profits decline - or net loss - for 1986 at
the expense of increased provisions.
    The newest and smallest of the joint ventures, <United Saudi
Commercial Bank> (USCB) reported a 1986 net loss of 15.9 mln
riyals, marginally less than 1985's shortfall of 17.0 mln.
    Profits before provisions were sharply higher, in part
reflecting an 18 pct staff cut last year. But the bank nearly
trebled the amount set aside against bad and doubtful loans to
60 mln riyals from 22 mln in 1985.
    Other results released so far show <Saudi American Bank>
(SAMBA) reporting a 53.8 pct fall in 1986 net profit to 80.7
mln riyals, while <Al Bank Al Saudi Al Fransi>, known as Saudi
French, slid 14 pct to 94.9 mln riyals.
    Both Saudi American, owned 40 pct by Citicorp's <CCI.N>
Citibank NA and Saudi French, 40 pct owned by Banque Indosuez,
increased provisions sharply.
    <Arab National Bank>'s net profit fell 17.8 pct to 152.1
mln riyals and provisions were more than doubled to 86.6 mln
riyals.
    Bankers said there are first signs that the number of non-
performing loans has stopped growing as the decline in the
Saudi economy bottoms out.
    Few are willing to predict a sharp upturn in economic
activity, but one banker said "The top 50 pct of the Saudi banks
are now at or close to international levels on provisions."
    From 1982 to 1985, the kingdom's largest bank <National
Commercial Bank> (NCB) stashed away 1.7 billion riyals in
provisions or 8.9 pct of its total loans and advances to the
private sector, bankers calculated.
    Between 1982 and 1985, <Riyad Bank>, NCB's rival as the
second biggest of the two all-Saudi shareholding banks, had
covered 12.8 pct of its loans and advances. Both banks operate
on an Islamic year that does not coincide with the other nine.
    Although the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) has been
tightening supervision, there is still no standardised rule for
declaring loans as non-performing.
    Bankers say this makes comparison of profit figures
difficult because some banks still book non-accruing interest
as revenue while others follow more conservative practices in
force in major world financial centres.
    Bankers generally said NCB, Riyad Bank and the
joint-ventures SAMBA, Saudi French and Arab National Bank rank
as the strongest earners.
    Other banks such as <Saudi British Bank>, 40 pct owned by
the <British Bank of the Middle East>, are disadvantaged by a
relatively low deposit base.
    Saudi British slashed 1985 profit 91 pct to just 9.1 mln
riyals and 1986 accounts due soon are expected to show another
low figure. But the bank has traditionally been one of the most
conservative in making provisions.
    Bankers said SAMA has proved it is not prepared to see a
Saudi bank go under and not only supported <Saudi Cairo Bank>
after its troubled 1985 accounts came to light but also made
available cheap deposits to <Saudi Investment Bank> and USCB.
    The banks can on-lend these to generate profit, but
generally banks are awash with liquidity since they are
unwilling to risk incurring fresh non-performing loans.
    And while banks in more liberal financial markets can
attempt to diversify away from traditional lending,
conservatism in Saudi banking has made it difficult to generate
fee income from new investment banking products.
    One banker said "Operating earnings in the Kingdom are not
good."
    Reflecting the caution in new lending, the amount of
advances is showing a declining trend, while the days when
banks had ample funds in interest-free current accounts to
invest are disappearing as Saudi customers seek a better return
on their money.
    In 1979, the ratio of interest-bearing accounts to current
accounts was 27 to 73 pct. Today, only about 40 pct of customer
funds are held on current account.

pct in fiscal 1987/88 for the first year-on-year increase in
three years, partly because of the yen's stable exchange rate,
the Nomura research institute said.
    Sales of all industries are predicted to rise 1.9 pct in
the year, which starts April 1, the research arm of Nomura
Securities Co said in a statement.
    Recurrent profits were estimated to fall 20 pct in the
current fiscal year with sales forecast to drop 14 pct.
    The forecast assumes an average rate of 148.5 yen to the
dollar in 1987/88, compared with 160 yen in the current year.
    Corporate efforts to cope with the yen's appreciation, such
as cutting production costs, are expected to bear fruit next
fiscal year, the institute said. The economy should also
benefit from pump-priming expected from the government and a
halt in rising prices of manufactured goods, it said.
    Recurrent profits of manufacturing industries are projected
to rise 29.6 pct next fiscal year against an estimated 40.1 pct
fall in the current year.
    Non-manufacturing sector profits will decline 4.5 pct in
1987/88 against an estimated 2.2 pct rise in the current year,

Boliden AB <BLDS ST> forecast a return to profitability during

a massive write-off.
    The company, which consolidated the Swedish wholesale and
investment conglomerate <Ahlsell AB> this year, said the result
included restructuring costs and write-offs of 802 mln crowns.
    "These costs have arisen as a results of a change of

burdened the annual accounts," the company said in a statement.
    Boliden said the company's liquid assets were 1.36 billion

announced it made a pretax profit of 84 mln stg in the 53 weeks
ending January 3, 1987, compared with 79.3 mln stg in the
previous year.
    Turnover was up to 1.29 billion stg from 1.2 billion. A
final dividend of 9.2p was proposed, after a final 8.2p last
year. Earnings per share rose to 35p from 34.8p.
    The results were broadly in line with market expectations,
leaving shares at 499p in early trading, up one pence from
yesterday's close, but slightly off pre-announcement opening
levels.
    Profit on ordinary activities after tax was 66.2 mln stg,
up from the previous year's 60.7 mln.
    The U.K. Remained Rowntree's largest centre for trading
profits, accounting for 47.9 mln stg, up from 45.3 mln in 1985.
Profit from its second largest geographical area, North
America, slipped to 34.7 mln stg from 37.2 mln. North American
profits were affected by the fall of the value of the dollar.
    Operations in continental Europe made 7.8 mln stg in
trading profit, up from 3.4 mln, with 4.0 mln stg made in
Australasia, up from 2.3 mln, and 11.3 mln stg from the rest of
the world, against 13.1 mln in the previous year.
    Extraordinary items amounted to a 11.3 mln debit after a
16.5 mln debit previously. A company spokesman said this
represented additional provisions for the cost of
rationalisation plans announced in earlier years.
    Rowntree expects North American operations will this year,
ahead of company expectations, be of the same order as those
from the U.K. And the rest of Europe combined, the statement
said. A spokesman said no specific figures had been forecast.
    Acquisitions will continue to be sought worldwide,
including further moves in the speciality retailing business
which Rowntree first entered in 1983, the statement said.
    Rising profit from Europe this year was forecast by
chairman Kenneth Dixon in a statement. He added the performance
of seven businesses bought last year was encouraging.
    The U.K. Confectionery side gained market share and
increased trading margins. The Sun-Pat British grocery concern
increased profit and Rowntree's small health food business,
Holgates, raised earnings 10-fold, the statement said.
    Offsetting factors included currency movements, which cost
the company nearly 5.0 mln stg. Sales tax hurt Canadian profits
on confectionery operations, and the company faced strong
competition in the U.K. Snack and Mid East export markets.

Ste Lyonnaise des Eaux <LYOE.PA> is likely to rise by at least
10 pct this year from the 360 mln francs reported for 1986,

    Group turnover should rise about seven pct from the 15.7
mln reported for this year, while group investments should
total around 1.8 billion francs, somewhat above the 1.3 billion
annual average of the past three years, he added.
    Investments will be aimed mainly at developing the group's
leisure industry, health and communications activities, Monod
said.
    In the leisure sector the group planned a joint development
with Club Mediterranee <CMI.PA>, Club Med, of a 200 hectare
pleasure park at Puisaye in the Yonne department of Eastern
Central France, he said.
    Wholly-owned subsidiary Lyonnaise de Developpement
Touristique would carry out the construction work and financial
planning of the development which would be leased to Club Med
as operator of the complex, he said.
    He gave no financial details but said leisure sector
investments would total about 100 mln francs over the next
three years.
    Investments in the communications industry would go mainly
to develop the group's cable television activities and its 25
pct owned Metropole Television affiliate. Metropole recently
won the concession to operate a sixth television channel in
France.
    Financing requirement of Metropole would be about 700 mln
francs over the next four years, of which Lyonaise des Eaux
would provide about 175 mln, Monod said.
    Monod said Metropole aimed to win a 15 to 20 pct audience
share and to capture about 10 pct of the national television
advertising market.
    Total investment by the group in the communications sector,
including cable activities, would be between 300 mln and 400
mln francs over the next five years, mainly concentrated in the
coming year.
    Investment in cable operations would total between 150 mln

another excellent year in 1987 after a 27 pct increase in 1986
net profit. Results in the first few months show it heading in
the right direction, company president Klaus Jacobs said.
    The group reported 1986 net profit of 190.9 mln Swiss
francs compared with 150.4 mln in 1985 and raised its dividend
per bearer share to 160 francs from 155 francs.
    Jacobs said the increase in profit, which far exceeded the
company's target of five pct real annual growth, had been made
possible by restructuring measures introduced in January 1986
which had also made some major acquisitions possible last year.
    Hermann Pohl, general director in charge of economic
affairs, said the 2.7 pct decline in group turnover to 5.24
billion francs was due to currency factors.
    A 5.2 pct negative currency influence was partially offset
by growth in operations and by structural changes within the
group.
    Turnover in the coffee business fell to 3.10 billion francs
from 3.56 billion in 1985 while turnover in the chocolate
sector rose to 2.14 billion francs from 1.82 billion. The
tonnage sold in both sectors declined due to higher prices and
lower consumer demand, especially in France and West Germany.
    Jacobs Suchard increased its market share in West Germany
to 44.9 pct from 39.9 pct in 1985, largely as a result of
acquisitions. Market share in France was little changed at 25
pct against 25.3 pct.
    Pohl said the group's average tax rate rose to 32.5 pct
from 28.8 pct because of the higher profits and despite
write-offs on the losses of new acquisitions. A further
increase in tax levels was expected in future.
    Taxes jumped 51.3 pct to 92 mln francs in 1986 from 61 mln
the previous year.

could make all of its scheduled montly debt service payments
for 1987 despite the falloff in its rental operations, but
making the payments would probably severely impair its
liquidity and restrict its ability to maintain the quality of
its properties.
    The company today reported a 1986 loss of 1,544,000 dlrs
compared with a 1985 profit of 3,912,000 dlrs.
    Southwest said in addition to its monthly scheduyled debt
service payments, a 1,743,000 dlr loan on one of its Houston
properties is due to mature on April One.
    Southwest said a commitment to reduce the interest rate and
extend the Houston loan for one year has been accepted.
    It said talks are underway with lenders on other Houston
properties to obtain partial debt service moratoriums which, if
granted, would cut 1987 cash deficits from 1986 levels.  The
loan renegotiations could involve bankruptcy or other
litigation connected with the specific properties involved and
could involve the suspension of interest and principal payments
to some of the lenders.  Southwest said if the attempts to
restructure debt do not succeed, it could lose one or more of
the properties.
    Southwest said the Houston properties made up about 10 pct
of its current value equity as of December 31 of 14.20 dlrs per
share, down from 16.68 dlrs a year before.
    The company said depending on the success of the talks and
operating results for 1987, one or two more properties could
become subject to similar negotiations.  The two additional
properties comprised about 11 pct of its current value equity
at year-end, Southwest said.

considering a reverse stock split of at least one-for-10 and
expects to report a second-quarter profit, compared to a loss
last year.
    The stock consolidation "is something we're discussing, but
it's not definite," Sand Technology president Jerry Shattner
told Reuters in an interview.
    A private placement recently brought the number of
outstanding shares to 106 mln, up from 97.1 mln shares on July
31, 1986, the fiscal yearend.
    "The company has always had the aura of a penny stock,"
Shattner said, adding that Sand plans, at some time, to apply
for listing on the Montreal Stock Exchange.
    Shattner said the company expects to report a profit of
five pct, or about 350,000 dlrs, on sales of seven mln dlrs,
for the second quarter ended January 31. Results for the third
quarter should be about the same as the second, he added.
    Last year, Sand lost 243,064 dlrs on revenues of 7,012,195
dlrs in the second quarter.
    After "a disastrous first quarter," Sand hopes to break even
in the current fiscal year, Shattner said. The company has
scaled back its sales forecast to about 25 mln dlrs, from the
33.5 mln dlrs projected in December.
    The rapid appreciation of the Japanese yen against U.S. and
Canadian dollars last year led to Sand's loss of 2.1 mln dlrs,
or two cts per share, on sales of 24.9 mln dlrs.
    In the first fiscal quarter this year, the company lost
1,350,387 dlrs, or one ct per share, on sales of 3,570,585
dlrs.
    Shattner believes the company will post better results this
year due to several factors.
    "Last year, one of our biggest problems was we were buying
products in Japanese yen. We now buy some products from Hitachi
in U.S. dollars and the results are starting to show up in the
second quarter," he said.
    Sand Technology sells, under its trademark, computer
accessories such as disk drives, solid-state memory enhancement
devices and printers manufactured by Hitachi Ltd <HIT> of
Japan.
    Shattner said Sand's affiliate in Detroit, ST Systems Inc,
is developing software that lets large maniframe computers
handle large databases and share them between applications.
    It is also distributing a new product called Sapiens, which
is artificial intelligence computer language for use by major
corporations.
    The company has also reduced costs through some staff
cutting and a switch to profit sharing plans for sales staff
instead of straight commissions, Shattner said.
    And Sand plans to market a laser printer in the fourth
fiscal quarter, Shattner said.

1986 net earnings of 582.3 mln dlrs, a rise from 221.2 mln dlrs
a year ago, marked a "major turning point" for the world's
second biggest retailer.
    K Mart said the earnings rise for the fourth quarter ended
January 28 to 285 mln dlrs from 10.5 mln dlrs resulted from 
"merchandising, refurbishing and expense control."
    A year ago, K Mart took a charge of 239 mln dlrs for
discontinued operations. Earnings from continuing retail
operations in the quarter totalled 270 mln dlrs or 2.00 dlrs a
share compared with 249.4 mln dlrs or 1.91 dlrs a year ago.
    K Mart Chairman Bernard Fauber said "the success of these
programs is better illustrated by the strong 35.9 pct increase
in 1986 income from continuing operations before income taxes
to 1.03 billion dlrs, the first time K Mart Corp has reached
this milestone."
    Sales for the 1986 fiscal year reached a record 23.8
billion dlrs, an 8.1 pct rise from 22.04 billion dlrs the prior
year. K Mart said 1985 was restated to account for discontinued
operations. Comparable store sales rose 5.5 pct in 1986 over
1985, it said.
    Fauber said the sales growth came from greater consumer
acceptance of K Mart's apparel merchandise, "a marked increase
in hardline merchandise sales and a growing contribution from
specialty retailing operations."
    K Mart said its fourth quarter pre-tax income from
continuing operations was 493 mln dlrs, a 32.3 pct gain from
372.6 mln dlrs last year. It said sales in the period grew 8.8
pct to 7.23 billion dlrs from a restated 6.65 billion dlrs in
1985 with comparable store sales up 4.7 pct.
    K Mart said its effective tax rate rose in 1986 to 44.6 pct
from 37.6 pct in 1985. But it said selling, general and
administrative expense eased to 23.2 pct of sales from 23.7 pct
in 1985.
    "Our performance in 1986 marks a major turning point for K
Mart," Fauber said in a statement.
    "In the years immediately prior to 1986, we focused on
changing the look of our stores and the structure of the
company."
    K Mart, he said, committed billion of dollars for store
remodeling and installing a centralized point of sale system,
upgraded its merchandise mix, acquired three large specialty
retailers, divested underperforming businesses and restructured
its long-term debt.
    "We were forced to pay a temporary price in the form of
slower earnings growth and a lower rating by the investment
community. However, beginning with the fourth quarter of 1985,
our improved performance is proof that our approach is correct
for the long term," the K Mart chairman said.

profit growth prospects for the coming years will be reduced by
increasing competition and continued costs for replacing old
telephone systems, deputy chairman Graeme Odgers said.
    Speaking at a news conference on the third quarter results
which were released earlier today, Odgers said the company
faced heavy costs for installing new digital telephone systems
in Britain for three to five years.
    He said <Mercury Communications Ltd>, a Cable and Wireless
Plc <CAWL.L> subsidiary, was becoming a significant competitor.
    Odgers said Mercury was seeking to make inroads into some
of British Telecom's most profitable areas.
    One company official privately estimated that British
Telecom still had a 99 pct share of the U.K. Telecommunications
market but feared that this could slip to 95 or 90 pct.
    The recent two-and-a-half-week engineering strike, which
lead to some disruption in service, could well have encouraged
clients to consider using the Mercury system, Odgers said.
    However, he forecast that the last quarter's results
overall should not be adversely affected by the walkout.
    He calculated salary savings as a result of the strike at
50 mln stg and while loss of income on telephone calls should
be limited revenue probably dropped on peripheral activities.
    But on balance Odgers said that group's financial strength,
economies of scale and the fact that it operates in a growth
industry will help produce annual profit increases for the
forseeable future.
    British Telecom will also seek to expand into
manufacturing, he said, adding that research and development
expenditure will rise both in terms of value and compared with
the current proportion of two pct of overall turnover.
    Analysts said the company's downbeat forecasts helped
shares dip to 242p in mid-afternoon, down 4p from yesterday's
close and off an early high of 248p.
    Philip Augar of stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co Ltd said
the market expects slower profit growth, but forecast a seven
to eight pct rise in both earnings per share and pretax profit
over the next two years. In the 1985/86 financial year, pre-tax
profit rose to 1.81 billion stg from 1.48 billion.
    Augar noted that a government-imposed formula linking
charges to inflation meant that the company's scope for raising
prices was limited as long as inflation remains low.

Nord Est plans to make a convertible bond issue for a total of
400 mln francs, President Gustave Rambaud said.
    He told a news conference Nord-Est expected to receive
approval from the Bourse supervisory body COB in the next two
week, when terms would set according to market conditions.
    He said the issue was meant to boost capital ahead of new
investments.
    Rambaud said the company would pay a 1986 dividend of 5.25
francs, unchanged on 1985. Parent company net profit last year
rose to 99.5 mln francs against 71.1 mln in 1985.
    Provisional consolidated profits were lower at 185 mln
francs compared with 200 mln in 1985, of which 120 mln, against
147 mln, was attributable to the group. He said the lower
profit was mainly due to losses made by steel-tube maker
Vallourec, in which Nord Est has a 12.5 pct stake.
    Rambaud said he forecast a 1987 parent company net profit
before provisions of around 135 mln francs.

(Adsteam) said its one-for-five rights issue at 11.50 dlrs a
share will raise 228.5 mln dlrs for general working capital and
investment, both in Australia and overseas.
    The group announced the issue with its first half earnings
and said in a statement that the rights issue will be followed
by a one-for-four bonus issue.
    Adsteam's equity-accounted net earnings rose to 75.05 mln
dlrs in the half ended December 31 from 55.68 mln a year
earlier and interim dividend to 18 cents from 16.
    Adsteam shares eased to 14.20 dlrs from an opening 14.60
and yesterday's close of 14.50 on the issue announcement.
    The issue will be underwritten by <Morgan Grenfell
Australia Ltd> and <McCaughan Dyson Ltd> apart from the shares
to be taken up by Adsteam's associate and largest shareholder,
department store retailer <David Jones Ltd>.
    New shares will not rank for the interim dividend but will
rank equally thereafter.
    Adsteam said it expects to maintain an annual dividend rate
of 36 cents on capital enlarged to about 149 mln shares by both
issues from 99.36 mln.
    Adsteam said its diverse industrial interests generally
performed well and its results, as the ultimate holding company
and beneficiary, reflected this solid performance.
    David Jones, owned 49.2 pct by Adsteam, earned the largest
associates' net of 57.38 mln dlrs in the half against 40.29 mln
a year earlier, Adsteam's figures show.
    Wholly-owned and joint venture companies also did well
apart from timber, building supplies and real estate, which
returned below-budget profits due to the housing downturn.
    Adsteam said it sees 1987/88 as a year of reconstruction
and consolidation with the capital base boosted by the issue.

have reported a percentage rise in net profits "close to double
figures" rather than the actual two pct had it not been for
November's warehouse fire, a senior company official said.
    The official, who declined to be identified, told Reuters
Sandoz had made a substantial addition to reserves to cope with
the consequences of the accident at Schweizerhalle, which
caused severe pollution of the Rhine.
    Sandoz today reported without comment a rise in net profits
to 541 mln francs from the previous 529 mln and a five pct
increase in dividend to 105 francs per 250 franc nominal share.
    This year began well, with the performance in January and
February at least equal to the same period last year, the
official said.
    The company is expected to give fuller details of its
results at a news conference on April 22.
    Sandoz has insisted that it is adequately insured to cover
any liability arising from the accident.
    The official said the addition to reserves was to cover the
"one pct" of claims somehow not covered and any voluntary
gestures it wanted to compensate for the effects of pollution
from the fire.
    Sandoz has not given any figure for claims, which have been
flowing in from Switzerland and other countries bordering the
Rhine since the accident.
    However, the official said the final figure would be "much
less than that cited in earlier comments." He gave no further
details.
    In line with fellow chemical giant Ciba-Geigy <CIGZ.Z>,
which reported last month, Sandoz profit and turnover were also
hit by the falling dollar, the official said.
    Sales in local currency terms were up by 14 pct, with
market share increases in the United States and Japan. But this
was more than offset by a 15 pct negative foreign exchange
effect, which produced the reported one pct drop in turnover to
8.36 billion francs,the Sandoz official said.
    Net profit at Ciba-Geigy dropped by 21 pct to 1.16 billion
francs, while sales fell by 12 pct to 15.95 billion francs.
    The third major Swiss chemical company, F. Hoffmann-La
Roche and Co <HOFZ.Z> has not yet reported its results.

 ]]></BODY><BODY><![CDATA[Schweizerische Aluminimum AG <ALUZ.Z>
(Alusuisse) may be able to break even this year after cleansing
its balance sheet for 1986, chief executive Hans Jucker said.
    "The threshold of profitability has returned to the
foreseeable future," he said. "We expect already in 1987
approximately to break even. That presupposes, however, that
our industrial environment does not worsen."
    He said Alusuisse would no longer face the burden of past
losses.
    Alusuisse made a net loss of 688 mln Swiss francs in 1986
after a restated 756 mln loss in 1985.
    Gross sales were 5.93 billion francs after 8.51 billion and
net turnover 5.65 billion after 8.00 billion.
    Alusuisse had originally reported a 692 mln francs loss for
1985.
    But Jucker and Finance Director Hermann Haerri told a news
conference the new management installed a year ago had decided
to restate the previous five years' accounts to eliminate
rights on Australian bauxite previously in the books as an
asset.
    Together with other one-off charges, Alusuisse took an
gross extraordinary charge in 1986 of 698 mln francs, up from
472 mln in 1985.
    It also had 106 mln extraordinary income in 1986 remaining,
after provisions, from the sale of its Maremont Corp subsidiary
in the United States. There were no extraordinary gains in
1985.
    Jucker said the losses, plus those carried forward from
1985, had wiped out the company's remaining reserves and
exceeded legally allowed levels, forcing Alusuisse to adopt a
50 pct capital cut, to be approved by shareholders on April 22.
    Jucker said he knew shareholders would find this "radical
elimination of the mortgages of the past" painful, but said the
foundation had been laid for a successful new company strategy.
    Haerri said despite the losses, the company's liquidity was
strong. Bank debt had been cut by about one-third to 2.56
billion francs against the end-1985 level of 3.85 billion.
    Cash flow improved substantially to 323 mln francs from 111
mln and represented 5.7 pct of turnover against a mere 1.4 pct
in 1985.
    In addition, to reassure other creditors, Alusuisse had
arranged with three major Swiss banks -- Union Bank of
Switzerland <SBGZ.Z>, Swiss Bank Corp <SBVZ.Z> and Credit
Suisse <CRSZ.Z>, to convert 300 mln francs of credits into a
subordinated loan.
    The main sources of losses in 1986 were book losses and not
cash losses, Haerri said. Existing credit lines were used only
to a small extent, and the parent company had been granted a
new credit line of 200 mln francs from a consortium of Swiss
banks that would cover most of the loans falling due in 1987.
    Haerri said the company had been criticized for maintaining
bauxite rights as an asset, and so had restated the accounts.
    That left the 1985 account with a 756 mln franc loss
instead of 692 mln, 1984 with a 68 mln profit instead of 169
mln, 1983 with a 217 mln loss instead of 82 mln and 1982 with a
479 mln loss instead of 179 mln.
    The new accounts show 1985 with shareholders' equity of
1.15 billion francs instead of 1.75 billion, and similar
alternations were made for previous years.
    After 1986 losses, shareholder's equity stood at only 895
mln francs.

the October-December quarter rose four pct from a year earlier
to 5,654 billion yen against a 2.6 pct year-on-year rise in the
preceding quarter, the Finance Ministry said.
    The improved earnings resulted mainly from a 22.5 pct
profit increase in non-manufacturing industries, supported by
an 88.7 pct rise for construction firms and a 138 pct gain in
real estate, according to a ministry survey.
    Total sales of the 15,308 firms with capital of 10 mln yen
or more which responded to the poll, fell one pct to 217,217
billion yen against a 1.2 pct fall the previous quarter.
    Current profits of manufacturing industries in the fourth

pct fall in the preceding quarter, the ministry said.
    Plant and equipment investments of all firms polled fell
3.9 pct to 8,004 billion yen, compared with a 1.4 percent fall
the previoius quarter.
    Ministry officials said the survey showed that the Japanese
economy is in a delicate stage in which it is hard to tell if
economic growth has stopped deteriorating or if the economy is
heading for a recovery.

stronger results for the third quarter ended February 22, said
it expects the momentum to continue in the fourth quarter.
    The company said it expects to report "strong earnings per
share growth and a record return on equity in fiscal 1987." It
said this should be achieved despite expected non-operating
charges in the final quarter.
    General Mills said these charges will likely offset
non-operating gains, which included six cts a share in the
first half.
    General Mills said at the end of the third quarter, its
return on average equity was 31.6 pct.
    It said major factors contributing to the third quarter
improvement were an 11 pct gain in unit volume by Consumer
Foods, continuing good profit growth at Red Lobster USA and
strong performance in Specialty Retailing.
    The company reported quarterly earnings of 56.9 mln dlrs,
or 64 cts a share, up from 46.4 mln dlrs, or 52 cts a share a
year ago. Sales rose to 1.31 billion dlrs from 1.13 billion
dlrs. Year-ago data reflect a two-for-one common stock split.

1.91 dlrs per share, on 5.65 billion dlrs in revenues.
    Anticipated improved cash flows will allow the company to

    Weyerhaeuser, principally a lumber products company, said
the forecast was made by the company's chief financial officer
during a meeting of institutional investors in Tokyo.
    It also said its expects to see opportunities in the
building products area, particularly in composite panels and in
other engineered products directed toward specific, rather than
commodity, end-use markets.
    But it said growth may be higher in added-value products,
in financial services and in other diversified businesses.
    In addition, the company said rising product prices and
demand for pulp and paper are reflected in all the major world

where overcapacity remains a problem.
    Weyerhaeuser further stated that it has lowered its

sales of its new AX compact car to help boost profits
significantly this year, continuing a financial recovery after
six straight years of losses, president Jacques Calvet said.
    Speaking to reporters during weekend trials for the new AX
sports model, he said: "All the budgetary forecasts that we have
been able to make ... Show a relatively significant improvement
in 1987, compared with 1986," he added.
    Citroen, part of the private Peugeot SA <PEUP.PA> group,
increased its share of the French new car market to 13.7 pct in
first two months 1987 from 12.1 pct a year earlier. It is
aiming for an average 12.8 pct share throughout the year after
11.7 pct in 1986.
    The firm believes it is on target to raise its share of the
European market, excluding France, to 3.2 pct this year from
2.9 pct in 1986.
    "Our first problem is to produce enough vehicles to meet the
demand," Calvet said. "This is a relatively new problem for us."
    Citroen lost close to two billion francs in 1984 but cut
the deficit to 400 mln in 1985, helped by moves to modernise
its range and improve productivity.
    Calvet indicated last December he expected Citroen's 1986
profit to be between 250 and 500 million francs.
    This weekend he said that those profit estimates "remain
about the same -- perhaps even a little more optimistic."
    Some of this optimism is due to the early success of the
AX, launched on the French market last October. It will be
available throughout most of western Europe within four months.
    The car has registered just over 20,000 sales.
    It is being built at Citroen's large plant at Aulnay-sous-
Bois in northern Paris, as well as at Rennes in Brittany and
Vigo in Spain, with production just reaching target level of
1,000 cars a day.
    The car, which Citroen markets as an intermediate model
between its long-running 2CV and the Visa, is designed to
compete with the Renault 5, Volkswagen Polo and Opel Corsa.
    The AX had built up its market share in France to around
four pct last month. Calvet said: "Our hope is that once the AX
is fully developed, we will have between 6.5 and seven per cent
of the national market."

business performance was likely to bottom out in the current
January-March quarter, the Finance Ministry said.
    Improved corporate earnings and better prospects for the
stability of the yen had made companies more optimistic, it
said after carrying out a quarterly survey.
    The survey, conducted in February, was based on
questionnaires returned by 8,328 large and small firms in all
sectors except the finance and insurance industries.
    The survey said overall corporate earnings were expected to
turn positive with an estimated 0.4 pct year on year increase
in the second half of fiscal 1986 ending on March 31 after a
5.4 pct decrease in the first half.
    Corporate earnings will grow further in the first half of
fiscal 1987, rising an estimated 10.7 pct, it added.
    Manufacturers' earnings, hit hard by the yen's steady rise
against the dollar, will rise 7.7 pct in first-half fiscal 1987
after falling 10.7 pct in the second half of fiscal 1986, it
said.
    Overall earnings of non-manufacturing companies will rise
11.8 pct year on year in the first half of fiscal 1987 after
growing 9.8 pct in the second half of fiscal 1986, the survey
said.
    It said this figure was bolstered by profits of firms such
as electric power and gas companies which have benefitted from
the yen's appreciation.

 ]]></BODY><BODY><![CDATA[With the April 15 tax return deadline
less than a month away, confused taxpayers will be converging
on H and R Block Inc's offices to interpret the new tax codes.
    Financial results for the nation's largest tax preparer are
expected to be good in fiscal 1987 but next year could be a
"bonanza," analysts say.
    "For the short term the key word is confusion, Block Vice
President Tom Bloch said in an interview. "When Congress
drastically changes laws, confusion results and tax preparers
benefit," Bloch said.
    "Next year, when taxpayers take the new forms and place
them side by side to compare them, more people will throw their
hands up and say 'I'm going to get help,'" he said.
"Tax forms will look very different next year," he added.
    Kidder Peabody analyst Herbert Buchbinder expects Block's
fiscal 1987 year (to end April 30) to show good gains over
fiscal 1986 earnings of 60.1 mln dlrs or 2.41 dlrs a share on
revenues of 606.7 mln dlrs. He estimates Block's fiscal 1987
earnings at 2.75 to 2.80 dlrs.
    "Next year, Block could have a bonanza," Buchbinder said.
Based on estimates of a larger work force, Block could show a
gain of more than five pct in tax forms prepared, he said. In
the 1986 tax season, Block prepared 9,215,300 U.S. tax returns,
up 1.5 pct over the previous year.
    The Internal Revenue Service estimates about 100 mln
individual income tax returns will be filed for the 1987 tax
season, up from last year's 94 mln forms. Professional tax
preparers accounted for just over 43 million forms, according
to the IRS.
    For the longer term, while confusion will continue to bring
clients into Block's 8,866 tax preparation offices worldwide,
there are some changes in the act that will have a negative
effect, Bloch conceded.
    Certain changes in filing requirements will shorten the tax
return, and in some cases, simplify the form, he noted. In
addition, some low income wage earners will be taken off the
tax rolls, he said.
    Block is currently analyzing its price structure to try to
offset some of the negatives. Last tax season, the average cost
for each return in the U.S. amounted to 48.05 dlrs and 45.73
dlrs worldwide, Bloch said. This tax season, rates will be up
about three or four pct, in line with the inflation rate, he
said.
    Block expects "some expansion" this tax season of its
electronic filing system which directly feeds into the IRS and
can speed up the refund process. Block can choose where and by
how much it wants to expand into the seven cities made
available for the direct filing by the IRS, Bloch noted.
    The IRS estimates about 90,000 returns will be directly
filed this tax season, up from the 26,000 returns injected in
the 1986 tax season.
    First Kansas City analyst Jonathan Braatz said that Block
will benefit greatly from lower tax rates in fiscal 1988.
    Braatz expects Block's advertising budget to be about the
same as last year which will be helped a bit by lower costs for
television ads. "They may get a little more bang for their
buck," he said.
    He estimates Block has about 150 mln dlrs cash on its
balance sheet sheet, and says if interest rates rise it could
be of great benefit to them.

    The company said a hearing on the adequacy of the
associated disclosure plan is scheduled for April Nine and
completion of the plan is subject to approval by creditors,
equity security holders and the bankruptcy court.
    Salant said it has reached agreement for Ray W. williams to

has substantially concluded talks for a new 15 mln dlr
unsecured credit, effective the same date.
    The company said the committee of its unsecured creditgors
and the committee of its equity security holders have approved
the terms of the plan.  As previously announced, creditors will
receive 450 mln dlrs in cash, 500 dlrs of 13-1/4 pct senior
subordinated debentures and four common shares for each 1,000

incur "substantial losses" for the second quarter ending March
31 and fiscal year ending Sept 30, 1987.
    As one factor behind the anticipated loss, Endotronics
cited a dispute by one of its Japanese distributors, <Yamaha
Inc>, over payment of a 3,686,000 dlr promissory note.
    In a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Endotronics said the note was for overdue accounts
receivable from sales of instruments to Yamaha and another
Japanese distributor during the company's 1986 fiscal year.
    Endotronics said at its present reduced level of operations
it will exhaust all currently available cash and credit
facilities in early May 1987. It said this assumes full use of
the remaining 1,250,000 dlrs available under a line of credit
from Celanese Corp, which requires approval of Celanese Corp
<CZ>.
    The company said its ability to obtain funding was
adversely affected by a suit filed March 4 by two of its
shareholders seeking to represent a class of holders against
three officers of Endotronics.
    Endotronics said the complaint against it alleges
violations of the federal securities laws in connection with
statements made in the company's annual and quarterly reports.
    The company also said the Securities Division of the
Minnesota Department of Commerce is conducting an inquiry into
the company's Japanese sales for fiscal 1986 and trading by
insiders and brokers in the company's common shares.
    It said similar inquiries are being conducted by the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The investigations will
hurt the company's ability to obtain funding, it said.
    As a result of the dispute over payment of the promissory
note, the law suit challenging its financial data and the
various investigations concerning insider trading, the company
said it no longer expects that anticipated declines in
instrument sales in Japan in fiscal 1987 will be offset by
increased instrument sales in other foreign countries and the
United States.

growth this year with the opening of 125 new stores in the U.S.
    The company, which is quoted on London's Unlisted

among Canadian trust companies, is pursuing a bold global
expansion that could someday lift the foreign share of its
yearly earnings to 50 pct, president Michael Cornelissen said.
    First Marathon Securities Ltd financial services analyst
Michael Walsh said Royal Trust's international growth target is
attainable. But it "will be a tremendous achievement because
... they're going to have to build an international earnings
base larger than the earnings of a lot of significant domestic
trust companies," Walsh said.
    Global operations, which made up 22 pct of Royal Trust's
154 mln dlr 1986 net profit, will post 33 pct profit growth
this year against an expected 15 pct jump in total company
profit, Cornelissen told Reuters in an interview.
    He said the foreign share of total profit would rise to 26
pct in 1987 and to 44 pct by 1990.
    Royal Trust, Canada's second largest trust company with
assets of about 19.54 billion Canadian dlrs, has operated
internationally since 1929 when it opened a London bank.
    Its aggressive global strategy began in the 1980s, when
other Canadian trusts, the equivalent of U.S. savings and
loans, were focusing on domestic retail banking.
    The company's overseas ambitions were whetted by heightened
domestic competition and impressive growth at its London bank
operations, which attained full British banking powers in 1980,
Cornelissen said.
    Last year, Royal Trust moved into continental Europe and
Asia with its 239 mln Canadian dlr acquisition of Dow Chemical
Co <DOW>'s Dow Financial Services Corp, which included asset
management, merchant and private banking companies.
    "It was a heaven-sent opportunity," Cornelissen said of the
Dow Financial acquisition. "We achieved in one year what would
otherwise have taken five to 10 years to set up."
    Cornelissen stressed that Royal Trust would shun direct
competition with major global financial institutions in
activities such as international lending and stock brokerage,
in order to exploit "profitable niches" overseas in traditional
trust activities such as asset management, private banking and
advisory services.
    He said that Royal Trust hoped to complete negotiations
"before the end of this month" to sell its London-based Savory
Milln brokerage, acquired in the Dow Financial deal.
    "The international market is so big and we have such a
miniscule share of it that growth opportunities are really
limited only by our energy and our desire to find more
business," he said, adding that in trust-type services, "we
don't think the international markets are well-served."
    Aiding Royal Trust's foreign growth are greater foreign 
investment interest in North America and increased Canadian
investment abroad, Cornelissen said.
    Central to Royal Trust's strategy is Asia, boasting rapid
economic growth and huge pools of Japanese capital, said
Cornelissen, whose company administers assets of 71.85 billion
dlrs, more than any other Canadian trust.
    Citing statistics indicating that by the year 2000, Asia
will contain two-thirds of the world's population and 50 pct of
global productive capacity, Cornelissen said, "We knew we had
to be there." Royal Trust's 14 international locations include
offices in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore. The company also
recently listed its shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
    The Royal Trust president said the company was stressing
growth within its overseas units, adding he did not foresee any
acquisitions in the "immediate future," although "we have our
eyes wide open for the right opportunities."
    Asked about Royal Trust's plans for the U.S., which the
company abandoned with the 1983 sale of its Florida bank units,
Cornelissen said the company faced a trust services market well
covered by hundreds of small regional banks.
    "That doesn't mean to say we shouldn't be in the U.S.,"
said Cornelissen. "That is probably one area that we will
probably do something with in the next five years."
    He said the company would continue to emphasize its home
Canadian market, which Cornelissen and financial services
analysts agreed would remain vital to Royal Trust.
    Proposed government regulations to allow Canadian banks,
trusts, insurance and securities dealers full participation in
one another's actitivies will mean more domestic competition
for Royal Trust, "but not drastically more," Cornelissen said.

 ]]></BODY><BODY><![CDATA[Salomon Brothers Inc said it raised
its opinion on Caterpillar Inc's stock to an aggressive buy
from a hold because of a brighter earnings outlook for 1988.
    Salomon analyst David Sutliff said in a statement he sees
1988 earnings of 3.35 dlrs a share, up from an earlier forecast
of three dlrs for the year. The outlook for 1987 remains at
2.50 dlrs to three dlrs.
    Caterpillar's stock was down 1/2 points at 46-1/4.
    "Although earnings will be poor for the next two quarters,
we believe that profits could begin to improve in the second
half - perhaps significantly - and should surge sharply through
1988 and 1989," he said.
    Sutliff said improved results should come from four factors
- higher prices, improved market share, reduced costs, and
improved demand.
    The higher prices will stick because its Japanese
competitor, Komatsu, has had to raise prices because of the
increased value of the yen, he said.

post record revenues and profits for 1987, Charles E. Exley Jr,
chairman and president, said.
    "Much of our considerable optimism about the future is
based on the strength of a continuing flow of new products,"
Exley told a meeting of securities analysts. "Our current
position is the strongest in modern NCR history with
new-generation offerings deliverable in every major category
this year."
    For 1986, NCR's earnings rose nine pct, to 3.42 dlrs a
share, on sales that increased 13 pct, to 4.9 billion dlrs.
    During the balance of 1987, Exley said NCR will pay close
attention to increasing its penetration of major accounts,
expanding its third-party distribution channels and continuing
its introduction of new products.
    "In 1986, new products introduced within the proceding 36
months accounted for more than 65 pct of our major equipment
order activity," he said.
    "At the end of two months," he added," I can say we are off
to a good start" for 1987.

flat net income for fiscal 1987 ending Oct. 31 against 125.8
mln dlrs or 3.43 dlrs a share a year ago.
    The company said the costs of a restructuring at its Carter
Hawley Hale Stores Inc unit and the previous purchase of an 8.5
pct stake in <Cadbury Schweppes PLC> will lead to the flat net
figure.
    It also said it may raise its stake in Cadbury Schweppes to
25 pct, but has not made any additional stock purchases so far.
    According to the restructuring, Carter Hawley plans to
spin-off its specialty stores, including Neiman-Marcus,
Bergdorf Goodman and Contempo Casuals, into a new company named
<Neiman-Marcus Group>, whose shares will trade on the New York
Stock Exchange, it said.
    As previously announced, General Cinema will own 60 pct of
the equity and 40 pct of the voting shares in the new company.
The restructuring is subject to approval by Carter Hawley
shareholders.

pursuing a three-point stragey that will achieve a 10 pct
annual increase in operating earnings throughout the remainder
of the decade.
    In 1986, SmithKline earned 521.1 mln dlrs or 6.78 dlrs per
share on revenues of 3.6 billion dlrs.
    The company said in its annual report that its
nonpharmaceutical business will play a major role in meeting
its earnings growth target, and will in fact grow faster than
its pharmaceutical business.
    SmithKline, whose major product is the antiulcer medication
Tagamet, said in the report that it intends to improve earnings
from existing products, expand its product portfolio and
optimize its financial resources.
    To bolster its position in the antiulcer market, in which
Tagamet has met stiff competition, SmithKline said its strategy
to develop an over-the-counter version of Tagamet is bolstered
by two joint ventures, one with <Wellcome PLC>, and one pending
venture in Japan.
    SmithKline also said its Allergan Inc eye and skin care
products division can be a one billion dlr organization in the
next five years that can grow at more than seven to 10 pct
annually.
    "Nondilutive acquisitions are a real possibility," Gavin
Herbert, president of the eye and skin care product group said
in the report. In 1986, Allergan had worldwide sales of 433 mln
dlrs.
    It said its Smith Kline and French Laboratories
pharmaceuticals unit, with 1986 sales of 1.9 billion dlrs, will
file for Food and Drug Administration marketing approval for a
number of cardiovascular agents, including tissue plasminogen
activator, over the next two years.
    It also said SK and F's U.S. sales force will be 20 pct
larger in 1987, with more than 1,000 sales personnel.
    Smith Kline also said its small clinical laboratory testing
unit, with 1986 sales of 373 mln dlrs, performs 24 mln tests a
year, and sees increases in employee drug testing as well as in
testing for the AIDS antibody.
    Smith Kline said that depending on its share price and the
cost of money, it may buy back more shares. In the last three
years, it has bought back about 25 pct of its shares.
    SmithKline begins the year with a new management team,
including its new chief operating officer George Ebright.

report a loss from operations in the second quarter.
    The company also said it expects to report a 10 mln dlrs
net gain in the quarter from excess pension funds used to pay
down debt. "However, it is difficult to determine now whether
this gain will be sufficient to offset the expected operating
loss," the company said in a statement. A company spokesman
would not elaborate.
    The company's Ashland Petroleum Co unit operated at a loss
in January and February since it was unable to raise product
prices enough to recover higher crude oil costs, Ashland said.
    Although Ashland Petroleum and SuperAmerica, a retail
marketing operation, are having a difficult quarter, the
company's Valvoline, Ashland Chemical and coal businesses are
expected to report good results for the quarter ended March 31.
    In the year-ago quarter, Ashland had income from operations
of 93.8 mln dlrs before corporate and interest expenses, taxes,
equity income and other items.
    Net income in the quarter was 39.4 mln dlrs or 1.12 dlrs a
share on sales of 1.78 billion dlrs.

    In a speech to the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce,

return to its position of preeminence.
    "Fundamental to achieving that goal is to continue to
reduce costs dramatically, to get our arms around our loan loss
problems and begin to reduce charge-offs, and to enhance our
revenue generation," Clausen said.
    Clausen said he doubts BankAmerica would be in a position
this year to make any acquisitions or experience any growth.
    He said BankAmerica will continue to reduce staff and
operations, noting that expense growth in 1986 increased only
one pct over 1985 expenses.
    Clausen also said it will continue to phase out its
overseas retail banking and concentrate on wholesale banking,
with emphasis on a premium list of multinational corporations.

Brazilian commercial bank subsidiary Banco Royal do Canada
(Brasil) S.A. sees opportunities for its own growth with an
expected substantial increase in Brazilian exports to Canada,
Banco Royal president Michael Brennan said.
    "They (Brazilian exporters) are very interested in the
Canadian market because it's an untapped market," Brennan told
reporters after a speech to the Brazil/Canada Chamber of
Commerce.
    Brennan said Brazil is currently exporting products like
paper machinery and ships to Canada.
    He said he hopes to see medium-term financing facilities
for Brazilian companies reinstated shortly, following an
agreement reached in January with international financial
authorities.
    Brennan estimated Brazilian exports to Canada totalled
roughly 800 mln Canadian dlrs in 1985 while imports from Canada
reached about 700 mln dlrs.
    Brennan said he expects Banco Royal profit to increase this
year from the three mln U.S. dlrs reported for fiscal 1986
ended September 30 but said he could not predict by how much
because of the country's uncertain financial climate.
    Brennan said he expects his bank's growth to come from
increased exports to Canada. Banco Royal is the only
Canadian-owned commercial bank in Brazil although <Bank of
Montreal> has a Brazilian investment bank subsidiary, he said.
    Brennan said he expected Brazil to be able to reach an
equitable agreement with foreign banks on restructuring its 68
billion U.S. dlr foreign debt, because the Brazilian economy is
essentially healthy. He said he believed Brazil might be in a
position to resume debt repayments within a year.
    Brennan said he could not comment on the impact of Brazil's
interest payment moratorium on the Royal Bank of Canada.

    In the annual report, Chairman Robert Reuss told
shareholders telephone profits will continued to be limited by
ceilings imposed by regulators as well as deregulation and
structural changes within the industry that have slowed growth
in the investment base for setting rates.
    As such, its first quarter 1987 results will be below last
year's first quarter of 1.11 dlrs a share, he said.
    "Several of the company's telephone units may be faced with
a reduction in the rates of return authorized by their

reductions and refunds to customers."
    Reuss said he is encouraged by the prospects for progress

favourable currency factors, Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd's
<CAPH.HK> 1986 profits are expected to surpass the airline's
forecast of one billion H.K. Dlrs, stock analysts said.
    Analysts said they expect the airline to show net earnings
of between 1.1 billion and 1.25 billion dlrs when it reports
results tomorrow for its first year as a public company.
    Cathay, 51 pct owned by Swire Pacific Ltd <SWPC.HK>, made
its earnings forecast in the prospectus for its flotation in
May last year.
    Cathay is expected to pay a 13-cent final dividend, making
a total of 19 cents for the year, as forecast in the
prospectus, analysts polled by Reuters said.
    They said the airline's performance improved in the second
half of the year after it reported interim profits of 503 mln
dlrs.
    The weakness of the local currency, pegged at 7.80 to one
U.S. Dollar, and low fuel prices moved further in the company's
favour from the assumptions made in the prospectus at the time
of the flotation, James Capel (Far East) Ltd said.
    James Capel estimates average fuel prices for the airline
industry in 1986 at 63 U.S. Cents per gallon, 27 pct below the
1985 level. It said a one pct movement in fuel prices would
affect Cathay's net profits by 10 mln dlrs and forecast profits
of 1.25 billion dlrs.
     Analysts said the company's estimates of fuel price and
currency movements set out in its prospectus were conservative.
    "This is reflected in their interim results which showed
that profit margin has increased," said Frederick Tsang of
Mansion House Securities (F.E.) Ltd.
    Cathay's six-month turnover rose 19.8 pct from year-earlier
levels, but profits rose 69 pct.
    The rise in oil prices in late 1986 had little impact on
the company's fuel oil bill last year, as aviation fuel prices
usually lag behind crude price movements by several months,
analysts said.
    By last September the yen had risen some 54 pct against the
Hong Kong dollar from the end of 1985, the mark 43 pct and
sterling 12 pct.
    "Overall the weakness of the Hong Kong dollar against
Cathay's major trading currencies helped push passenger yields
in the first half up 7.2 pct," said James Capel. "This should
continue through the second half to enable passenger yields to
end the year up 7.6 pct."
    A strong performance from the 2.9 billion dlrs in cash
under management also improved profits, James Capel said.
    A general improvement in air traffic last year contributed
to Cathay's revenue increase, but the company's load factor
declined because of increased competition and an expansion of
its fleet and services.
    James Capel estimated Cathay's passenger-kilometres flown
last year rose six pct from 1985 and freight-kilometres flown
climbed 17 pct, though the airline's load factor probably fell
to 68.8 pct from 70 pct.
    "Cathay added new planes, and was forced to fly some routes
last year because of the threat of competition from Dragon Air,"
said Tsang. "This affected its load factor."
    Fear of possible competition from fledgling carrier <Hong
Kong Dragon Airways Ltd> may have contributed to Cathay's
decision to resume service to New Zealand last year, analysts
said.

the sale of its stake in <Imperial Continental Gas Association>
will result in a pre-tax profit of about 44.1 mln dlrs or 4.69
dlrs per share, fully duliuted, in the first quarter of 1987.
    Gulf said it sold its remaining stake in Imperial of 
6,631,222 shares and 100,000 units of loan stock for 74.8 mln
dlrs, based on an exchange rate of one pound sterling at 1.58
dlr. As previously reported, it sold 9,534,633 of its Imperial
shares on March nine.
    Gulf said the sale of the Imperial shares were accepted as
part of a recent tender offer made by <Groupe Bruxelles Lambert
S.A.> and <Tractebel S.A.>.
    Under the terms of the offer, Gulf said it is entitled to
receive a supplementary payment if a general offer to acquire
Imperial Continental or its Calor Group or Contibel Holdings
becomes wholly unconditional before Jan 1, 1988 at a price
above the tender off of 710 pence per share.

    Falling sales and lower world prices of fertilisers were
largely responsible for the sharp increase, along with the
effects of the dollar's fall which has helped to give U.S.
Fibre producers a competitive edge, he told Reuters.
    The firm would have made a small profit in 1985 had it not

said the near doubling of net profits in 1986 was due in large
part to the sale of shares in Genstar Corp.
    The company, which announced a net non-consolidated profit
of 5.31 billion francs compared with 2.82 billion in 1985, said
its current profits rose by 19 pct last year, without giving
further figures.
    However, it added in a statement that the company made
major capital gains on sales during the year, in particular
from the sale of Genstar shares.
    Societe Generale governor Rene Lamy told last November's
annual meeting that 1986 asset disposals would total around 4.5
billion francs, including the sale of Genstar shares to Imasco
Limited <IMS.TO>.
    He predicted a profit on extraordinary items of two billion
francs after a rough balance in 1985.

sharply after Wall Street firm Furman Selz Mager Dietz and
Birney issued a report focusing on the strong earnings
potential from the company's Australian gold holding, traders
familiar with the report said.
    Traders said the report notes that earnings from Australian
gold holdings could be worth about 35 cts to 55 cts a share
this year and 1.40 dlrs to two dlrs a share in 1988.
    Reynolds Metals rose three points to 59-5/8 on volume of
729,500 shares.
    Reynolds owns stakes in the Mount Gibson gold project and
the Boddington gold project, both located in Australia. An
analyst familiar with the two mines said "the properties,
together, have a potential value of 20 dlrs to 40 dlrs a share
for Reynolds."
    The analyst, who asked not to be identified, said the rise
in the stock today was likely the result of "U.S. investors
that were not completely cognizant of the size or the
importance of the (Reynolds') holdings in Australia."
    Traders said the Furman Selz report indicates that gold was
discovered mixed with bauxite in the Boddington mine.
Boddington is principally a bauxite mine.
    The traders said the report goes on to say that the profits
from the Boddington gold with substantially reduce the
production costs of the other metals mined at Boddington.
    Traders said Furman Selz also boosted its earnings
estimates, expecting Reynolds Metals to earn 4.10 dlr a share
in 1987 and eight dlrs a share in 1988.
    Last year, Reynolds reported net earnings of 8.18 dlrs a
share, which included 3.09 dlrs a share for adoption of new
accounting rules, 1.01 dlrs a share for tax loss carryforwards
and other extraordinary items.

    He told a news conference the company expected costs for

22nd consecutive year of new records in financial growth" for
the fiscal year ending April 30, Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Anthony O'Reilly told investment analysts.
    O'Reilly, who declined to make a specific projection, said
the food company is "stronger than at any time in its 118-year
history."
    Last week Heinz reported third-quarter earnings rose to 55
cts a share from 46 cts a share. Sales rose to 1.08 billion
dlrs from 1.01 billion dlrs a year earlier.
    O'Reilly said Heinz will concentrate on backing its big
brands, new products and services, new geography, internal
growth and acquisitions.
    He said Heinz Ketchup has its highest market share in
history, 55 pct. But in response to a question, the executive
said a volume falloff in the overall product category "is a
concern to us."
    O'Reilly said Weight Watchers continues to perform well and
will generate revenue in fiscal 1987 of approximately 940 mln
dlrs.
    O'Reilly told analysts Heinz is in active negotiations to
build a second plant in China, where it entered a joint venture
with the government in 1984, forming Heinz-UFE Ltd, which
produces dry baby food cereal.
    He said Heinz-Japan is "making a profit and generating its
first substantial dividends," and implementation of a new
partnership, Seoul-Heinz Ltd, is moving ahead with a new
manufacturing plant targeted for completion by June in Seoul,
South Korea.
    To increase its competitiveness, O'Reilly said Heinz
implemented a "lowest cost imaginable" program targeted at
manufacturing, sales and marketing and procurement.
    He said a modernization program is in effect at the
company's United Kingdom operations, where the labor force,
trimmed to 4,000 from 10,000, is expected to be further reduced
to 2,500 in 1988.

Importing, a publicly-held wholesale food distributor.

forecast another good year in 1987 in view of good growth in
both passenger and cargo traffic volumes early this year over
the year-earlier period.
    The airline did not quantify its performance in early 1987
but said it would take delivery of one Boeing Co <BA.N> 747
freighter and one Boeing 747-300 passenger plane in September
and November respectively after it took a 747-300 last month.
    It earlier reported a 58.7 pct increase in 1986 net profit
to 1.23 billion H.K. Dlrs and announced a final dividend of 14
cents a share.
    But Cathay Pacific recorded sharp increases in net finance
charges to 124.9 mln dlrs from 44.4 mln a year.
    A spokesman for the firm linked the rise to two aircraft
deliveries in 1986.
    However, the company said in a statement good returns from
funds placed with investment managers had partly offset higher
interest costs resulting from additional lease financing and
other borrowing.
    It added that the airline last year also saw aviation fuel
prices fall to an average 4.59 dlrs a gallon from 6.76 dlrs in
1985.
    Passengers carried by Cathay Pacific totalled 4.2 mln last
year, up from 3.85 in 1985, with the passengers kilometre
travelled rising to 14.02 billion from 12.56 billion. But
passenger load factor was down to 69.1 pct from 71.0 pct.
    The airline's cargo operations recorded growth of 21 pct in
total tonnage over the previous year and a 35.9 pct rise in
revenue to 1.79 billion dlrs.
    Cathay Pacific floated its shares in April, 1986 and is now
50.23 pct owned by Swire Pacific Ltd <SWPC.HK>, 16.43 pct by
Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp <HKBH.HK> and 12.5 pct by

expected to be down 65 pct for the five months ending March 31
from the same period a year ago at around 10 billion yen, if
the yen dollar rate remains at the present level, managing
director Tsunao Hashimoto told a press conference.
    Sony will have an irregular five-month business term ending
March 31, as its financial year will be changed to run from
April 1 to March 31 from the current October 31 year end.
    Group sales in the same period are estimated at about 550
billion yen, down five pct from a year earlier, he said.
    The company earlier reported net income of 7.65 billion yen
in the three month period ended January 31, down 59.2 pct from
a year earlier, on sales of 343.06 billion, down 6.3 pct.
    The gloomy profits and sales resulted from the yen's recent
appreciation against the dollar and a sharp drop in market
prices due to severe sales competition at home and abroad.
    The yen rose 26 pct to an average of 159 yen to the dollar,
reducing the company's total sales in the three month period by
40 billion yen, Hashimoto said.
    Sales of 8-mm video camera/recorders totalled 300,000 units
in the three months, unchanged from a year earlier, while
Beta-format video tape recorders (vtrs) sales fell to 300,000
from 350,000. Sales of compact disc players rose to 450,000
from 300,000 and those of the Walkman rose to 2.25 mln from
1.30 mln but colour television sales fell to 950,000 from one
mln due to lower exports to China.
    Sales of 8-mm vtrs had already exceeded Beta-format vtrs
sales since the beginning of fiscal 1986, Hashimoto said.
Overseas sales accounted for 68.2 pct of the total in the three
months compared with 71.3 pct a year earlier.
    Overseas production will account for 35 pct of its total
production in 1990 from the present 20 pct.
    Hashimoto also said parent current profit in the five-month
period is estimated at around 17 billion yen, down 33 pct from
a year earlier, on sales of 400 billion, down 12 pct.
    Sony is hoping to retain at least 1985/86 levels of group
net profits and sales in the new financial year starting April
1 1987, he added. The company made 41.9 billion yen group net
profit in the year ended November 31 1986, down 42.6 pct from a
year earlier, on sales of 1,325 billion, down 6.7 pct.

businesses will accelerate sales growth this year but hold back
increases in operating income in the near future.
    CooperVision said "Furthermore, until the entire net cash
proceeds from the recent sales of several of our businesses are

1986 pre-tax profits were lower than forecast because of
depreciation in the value of its Guinness Plc <GUIN.L> shares
and because of securities trading losses in the U.S.
    Morgan chairman Lord Catto said the losses on the group's
seven mln Guinness shares in addition to a 3.5 mln dlr loss on
its risk arbitrage operation in New York depressed profits some
eight mln stg to 82.2 mln.
    He also told a news conference Morgan had received informal
approaches about a takeover of the group but was not
interested. No formal offers had been made, but Catto would not
elaborate.
    Morgan Grenfell acted as merchant banker to Guinness during
the brewing company's successful bid for Distillers Co Plc
<DIST.L> in the first half of last year.
    The U.K. Government launched an investigation into the
affairs of Guinness last December. Public concern has focused
on the way Guinness may have breached U.K. Company law and the
Takeover Code by prompting others to support its share price
during the bid.
    Morgan chief executive Christopher Reeves, head of
corporate finance Graham Walsh and senior corporate finance
director Roger Seelig all resigned in January over the Guinness
affair.
    Another senior Morgan Grenfell executive, Geoffrey Collier,
resigned late last year on allegations of trading on insider
information. He currently faces criminal charges.
    Lord Catto said the second half of 1986 had been "one of the
most traumatic in our history," but that clients and staff had
been supportive.
    "I certainly look on the future in a positive way. We have
the worst behind us and have swept nothing under the carpet."
    Profits for the year, up 19.4 pct from 1985 pre-tax profits
of 68.8 mln stg, were mainly due to a high contribution from
corporate finance activities and progress in asset management.
    Finance Director David Ewart told the news conference the
performance of the group so far in 1987 was "within reasonable
touch of the budget."
    Lord Catto also said the group was actively seeking a new
chief executive to replace Sir Peter Carey, who is acting as
interim director after Reeves' resignation, and hopes to have a
new chief executive within a few months.
    He also said Reeves and Walsh had been paid a total of
562,000 stg in compensation following their resignations, but
declined to say how much each man got. Negotiations were going
on to determine an amount of compensation for Seelig, he said.
    Morgan Grenfell shares stood at a late 366p, 9p down on
yesterday's 375p.

subsidiary of Volkswagen AG <VOWG.F>, said profit in 1986 fell
by around half compared with 1985, when it achieved a record
221 mln marks net profit, a rise of 19.5 pct on the previous
year.
    Managing board chairman Wolfgang Habbel told a news
conference he expected both profit and turnover to rise this
year compared with 1986, but he said it was questionable
whether 1987 profit would return to 1985 levels.
    He gave no figure for 1986 profit. Audi had predicted last
year that 1986 profit would likely fall by an unspecified
amount from 1985's record levels.
    Habbel said turnover in 1986 rose to 9.9 billion marks from
9.6 billion in 1985 and looked certain to rise to over 10
billion this year.
    Asked whether Audi would pay a dividend to VW to help the
parent company overcome its currency losses, Habbel said Audi
would ensure VW got a share of profits.
    Audi's entire 1985 net profit was paid into its own free
reserves to help finance investment. In the previous 10 years
VW had received 80 pct of Audi's earnings as a dividend.
    Habbel blamed the profit decline on disruptions to output
caused by the introduction of the new Audi 80 model, on
currency factors and on negative publicity in the U.S. About
alleged "sudden acceleration" of some of its Audi 5000 models.
    As reported, Audi's sales in the U.S. Dropped nearly 20 pct
to 59,800 last year.
    Habbel said the U.S. Sales decline would probably bottom
out in 1987.
    Audi's worldwide car deliveries fell two pct to 363,000.
    Of the total, exports fell 10.5 pct to a rounded 210,000,
but domestic sales increased to a rounded 154,000 from 137,180
in 1985.
    Habbel said the new Audi 80 had sold extremely well in the
first two months of 1987, helping Audi to increase its overall
market share in West Germany to 8.4 pct from 5.2 pct in the
same months of 1986. Sales in Europe also rose but U.S. Sales
fell further, he said without giving details. Worldwide
deliveries in the first two months increased eight pct to

    Audi said in January that 1987 car production would rise to
over 400,000 from 384,000 in 1986, when output had fallen
compared with 1985's 392,000.
    Habbel said Audi expected the rise in output to lead to

Brazilian debt moratorium remains in effect, it may place its

    This would increase non-performing loans by about 380 mln
dlrs and reduce income before taxes and net income by about 10
mln dlrs in the 1987 first quarter and 35 mln dlrs for the full
year, company officials told a press briefing.
    Loans to Brazil at 1986 year end totaled 474 mln dlrs,
according to the annual report released at the briefing.
    In February 1987, the Brazilian government, citing a
declining level of foreign currency reserves, declared a
moratorium on the payment of interest on the country's medium
and long term debt obligations.
    Continental said it may take similar action on its loans to
Ecuador, which total 25 mln dlrs. This would reduce 1987

and by two mln dlrs for the full year, the bank-holding

substantial impact on Continental Illinois Corp, the company's
annual report says.
    One provision repeals the reserve method of providing for
bad debts for banks with over 500 mln dlrs in assets and
requires that tax loan loss reserves taken in the past, be
restored to current earnings status, it said.
    As a result, those amounts will be subject to federal
taxes, it said. No amounts were disclosed.
    Continental said it decided to deal with this change "in
its entirety" in 1987.
    Tax reform will also change foreign tax credit limitation
rules, and although the impact will not be material in the
short term, the Act will require, for the first time, that
income from certain foreign subsidiaries be taxable, the report
said.
    The new legislation also reduces existing tax credits by
17.5 pct in 1987 and 35 pct in 1988 and later years, it said.
    Continental's investment tax credits carryforwards of 12.8
mln dlrs at 1986 year end will be reduced to 10.6 mln dlrs in
1987 and, if not used in 1987, to 8.3 mln dlrs in 1988, it
said.
    Another provision of the Act could result in limiting the
use of tax credits if a change in ownership of Continental
takes place, the report said.
    This could happen if the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp
sells enough shares of Continental's common stock over the next
two years to cause a change in ownership, it noted.
    In December, the FDIC sold about one-third of its junior
convertible preference stock in Continental to the public in
the form of common stock.

Chairman John Swearingen said he sees negotiations to
reschedule Brazil's debt payments taking at least three to six
months.
    Brazil declared last month a moratorium on payment of
interest on its medium- and long-term debts. The moratorium is
expected to persist the entire time that debt scheduling talks
are under way.
    "I believe it will take three to six months, maybe longer,
for an arrangement to be worked out to reschedule Brazil's
debt," Swearingen told reporters at a press briefing.
    "I think Brazil will pay its debts in the long run. Just
how long the run is is anybody's guess," Swearingen said.
    Earlier the bank holding company said Brazil's moritorium
may force it to increase non-performing loans by 380 mln dlrs
and reduce pretax and net income by 10 mln dlrs in the first
quarter and 35 mln dlrs for the full year.
    The bank will decide March 31 whether to characterize these
loans as non-performing, William Ogden, chairman of the
Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Co of Chicago,
Continental's largest subsidiary, said in response to an
inquiry.
    Ogden said the moratoriums will affect both pretax and net
income equally because the banking firm has tax credits to use.
    Swearingen predicted an increase in operating profits for
1987 because he sees higher income and reduced expenses.
Continental will reduce expenses through job cuts and reducing
office rental costs. In 1986 it cut about 850 positions.
    In 1986 it had net profits of 165.2 mln dlrs or 60 cts a
share, up from 150.5 mln dlrs or 53 cts a share.
    The bank transferred 459 mln dlrs of poor-quality loans and
other assets to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, FDIC,
during 1986. It can transfer bad loans under the terms of the
1984 restructuring agreement with the government.
    The bank will transfer the remaining 460 mln dlrs that it
is entitled to transfer to FDIC by September 26, 1987,
Swearingen said. It will choose loans based on ultimate loss
rather than their immediate effect on non-performing loans.
    In 1986 the bank's loans to the Midwest's middle market
rose 20 pct at a time of overall weak loan demand in the U.S.
    Concerning banking acquisitions, Swearingen said the bank
would like to buy additional suburban Chicago banks. In 1986 it
bought three small suburban banks.
    Swearingen said he is concerned that Continental will be
taken over because no bank in the Midwest region is large
enough to buy it, and New York money center banks are
prohibited by law from buying Illinois banks.
    He said, however, that the FDIC still has control over who
will eventually own the firm because it still holds the
equivalent of 148 mln common shares out of a total 215 mln.
    The FDIC sold 52 mln shares to the public last year and has
said it intends to sell the rest as quickly as possible. The
agency received the shares as part of its 4.5 billion dlrs 1984
bailout of the bank.
    Swearingen, who came out of retirement in 1984 to head the
struggling banking firm after a career as an oil industry
executive, said he will retire when the three-year period he
agreed to be Continental chairman ends in August. He would not
comment on a successor.
    The bank will expand its First Options of Chicago options
clearning unit into Tokyo, Swearingen said, but said its
doubtful lending to Japan will occur because that country
doesn't need external sources of cash.

1987 earnings per share to increase over 1986 levels.
    "We are confident that 1987 will top 1986 in earnings per
share and are optimistic about our longer-term future as well,"
the company said in its 1986 annual report.
    In 1986, CPC earned 219.2 mln dlrs, or 2.30 dlrs a share,
on revenues of 4.55 billion dlrs compared with income of 142
mln dlrs or 1.46 dlrs on sales of 4.21 billion dlrs in 1985.
The share figures are adjusted for a 2-for-1 split paid in
January.
    A share buyback program started last year reduced the
number of shares outstanding to 82.6 mln at year-end 1986 from
97.2 mln dlrs the end of 1985, adjusted for the split.
    The food and grocery products company also said it was the
subject of five stockholder lawsuits and one class action suit,
filed last November and December in Delaware, New York and New
Jersey.
    The suits are related to the company's purchase of its
shares from Salomon Brothers Inc after Salomon bought a block
of the stock from Ronald Perelman, who had acquired nearly 3.7
mln CPC shares, or 7.6 pct of the company, last year.
    The suits allege the company bought the shares back at an
artificially inflated price, violating securities laws,
breaching directors' fiduciary duties and wasting corporate
assets.
    CPC said the defendants, which include the company, its
directors, Salomon and Perelman, deny all the allegations of
improper conduct and are defending the suits.

its board has decided to cancel coal-fired Mayo Unit Two, the
second unit planned for its Mayo Plant in Person County, N.C.
    The company said the 690,000 kilowatt unit was only about
one pct complete and was scheduled for commercial service in
1992.
    Carolina Power said the status of the unit had been under
review because of a decision by the North Carolina
Environmental Management Commission that would have required
the unit to be equipped with expensive sulphur dioxide-removing
scrubbers.
    Carolina Power said Unit One, which has been in operation
since 1983, meets all air quality regulations without scrubbers
through the use of low-sulphur coal, and "The addition of
scrubbers to Mayo Unit Two would have produced only marginal
air quality improvements."
    The company said it will be able to purchase lower-cost
power from Duke Power Co <DUK> for intermediate and peaking
purposes than the projected cost of power from Mayo Two with
scrubbers.  It said it will retain the Mayo Two site for later
development of a generating unit.
    Carolina Power said Mayo Two was projected to cost about
877 mln dlrs, including 200 mln dlrs for scrubbers.  "The
higher construction costs, plus higher operating costs, would
increase the cost of power produced by Mayo Unit Two with
scrubbers by about 90 mln dlrs per year."
    A company spokesman said the company has already spent
about 23 mln dlrs on Mayo Two. He said no estimate has yet been
made of the cost of canceling the plant, but the company does
not expect to take a charge against earnings.  He said Carolina
Power intends to include the cancellation costs in rate filings
it will make late this year or early next year.

 ]]></BODY><BODY><![CDATA[Laidlaw Transportation Ltd said
earnings per share for the current fiscal year should increase
by "substantially more" than the 30 pct average annual growth
experienced in the last four years.
    Revenues for the year ended August 31 will be about 1.2
billion dlrs, including GSX Corp, the U.S. waste services unit
acquired from Imasco Ltd last year for 358 mln dlrs, Laidlaw
president Michael de Groote told analysts.
    Last year, Laidlaw had operating earnings of 66.2 mln dlrs,
or 63 cts per share, on revenues of 717.8 mln dlrs.
    De Groote also said the company expects "excellent results"
in the second quarter ended February 28, but would not be more
specific.
    He said his revenue estimate for fiscal 1987 does not
include possible further acquisitions and said that the
addition of GSX will produce increasing benefits in fiscal 1988
through fiscal 1990.
    De Groote said the increased earnings in the previous four
quarters was due partly to internal growth of about 15 pct. The
rest came from acquisitions, he said.
    Laidlaw expects to sell a small rubber recycling operation,
a subsidiary of GSX, within the next few weeks, but this will
not make any material contribution to earnings, de Groote said.
    He also said he is "not very optimistic" about the ongoing
negotiations to buy 50 pct of Tricil Ltd, a Toronto-based
chemical and solid waste services company with Canadian and
U.S. operations, from <Trimac Ltd> of Calgary.
    De Groote said that, regardless of the outcome of the
proposed Tricil acquisition, Laidlaw will decide within the
next 30 days whether to stay in the North American chemical
waste business through GSX Corp.
    "We feel it is a profitable business with good growth
potential and we now want to stay in it if we can get the right
management," de Groote said.
    Laidlaw financed the acquisition of GSX by its U.S.
subsidiary, Laidlaw Transportation Inc, with the proceeds of a
200 mln Canadian dlr preferred stock issue and borrowing.
    De Groote said the company will gain about 138 mln dlrs in

    De Groote also said waste services in fiscal 1987 will
represent about 49 pct of revenues, school buses will
contribute 49 pct and trucking about two pct.
    The trucking subsidiary in western Canada is performing
well and there are no plans to sell it, he said.
    He would not estimate the contribution of each segment to

acquisitions of school bus operations in the U.S. are likely

oilpatch regions contributed to the first decline in overall
income for U.S. banks in a quarter century, the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp (FDIC) said.
    The nation's 14,181 commercial banks had net income of 17.8
billion dlrs in 1986, down slightly from 1985's record 18.1
billion dlrs.
    The total was still the second highest ever reported, but
it was the first time income had not grown since 1961.
    The figures reflected a radical split in the health of
banks in the two halves of the country, the FDIC said.
    In the East, one in 12 banks had losses last year, while
one in four banks west of the Mississippi River had losses.
    Nationwide, one out of five banks reported losses, the FDIC
said in the first of a new series of quarterly banking profiles
it planned to issue.
    "I don't remember a time when there was such a clear
distinction by geographic area," FDIC Chairman William Seidman
told reporters.
    He said that while the figures were not good, they showed
the problem did not lie with the banking system as a whole but
with regional differences in economic performance.
    Some 44 banks have failed so far this year, twice as many
as failed by this time a year ago, but Seidman said he doubted
the pace would continue. 
    On a positive note, banks increased capital to a record 208
billion dlrs last year, and there has been a slowing in the
number of new problem banks in all regions except the
Southwest, Seidman said.
    Banks' provision for losses from bad loans in the fourth
quarter increased to 21.7 billion dlrs, a 23 pct rise from a
year ago.
    Large banks -- those with assets of one billion dlrs or
more -- reporting fourth-quarter losses totaled 22, the FDIC
said.
    Seidman said it was too early to say what effect Brazil's
moratorium on debt interest payments would have on U.S. banks.
    He said bank deregulation had given managers more freedom
to run their banks and that an increase in failures was to be
expected.
    But this freedom from regulatory restraints also has meant
other banks that were better managed have gotten stronger,
Seidman said.

[OLBV.VI] expects to maintain its dividend and to record a
moderate rise in profits this year after the 181.5 mln
schilling net profit made in 1986, General Director Gerhard
Wagner said.
    Wagner told a news conference that last year's 34.3 pct
rise in net profit from 135.1 mln in 1985 was largely due to
greater domestic business and wider margins on schilling
interest rates.
    The bank, Austria's third largest, raised its 1986 dividend
to 12 pct of its 1.5 billion schilling nominal share capital
from 10 pct on capital of 1.35 billion in 1985.
    Announcing the 1986 results, Wagner said: "We will endeavour
to maintain the higher dividend in 1987."
    Laenderbank's balance sheet total rose five pct to 197.7
billion schillings against 8.1 pct growth in 1985. Foreign
currency business last year accounted for some 37 pct of
balance sheet total compared with about 41 pct in 1985.
    Wagner blamed the realtive shrinkage of foreign business
chiefly on the dollar's fall against the schilling, which is
effectively pegged to the mark. The dollar's weakness had wiped
some 8.9 billion schillings off the balance sheet total.
    Wagner declined to give an exact figure for profits from
the bank's London branch, which opened in April 1985, but said
that it came close to one mln stg.
    On schilling lending, profit on interest had risen 18 pct
to 2.19 billion schillings while commission earnings climbed
8.7 pct to 738.9 mln.
    According to the 1987 federal budget, the state is due to
lower its stake 60 pct in Laenderbank, probably to 51 pct.
Wagner said the exact timing of the move depended on the state.

    Fairfax earlier reported net earnings edged up 2.3 pct to
25.94 mln dlrs in the 26 weeks ended December 28 from 25.35 mln
a year earlier although pre-tax profit rose 9.1 pct to 48.30

    Net would have risen 10.1 pct but for the increase in
company tax to 49 pct from 46 and the imposition of the tax on
fringe benefits, paid by employers and not the recipients, the

    Fairfax also pointed to the cyclical downturn in revenue
growth in the television industry as another reason for the
flat first half earnings.
    It said it considered the result satisfactory in view of
these factors.
    Fairfax said its flagship dailies, The Sydney Morning
Herald and the Melbourne Age, boosted advertising volume, as
did the Australian Financial Review, and posted extremely
satisfactory performances. Magazines also performed strongly.
    But an 8.9 pct rise in television costs outweighed a 4.0
pct rise in revenue, it said.
    Fairfax said a fall in net interest also contributed to net
earnings because group borrowings were reduced following the
receipt of a 96.11 mln dlr capital dividend from <Australian
Associated Press Pty Ltd> (AAP) after the sale of AAP's "B"
shares in Reuters Holdings Plc <RTRS.L>.
    This accounted for the 89.32 mln dlr extraordinary profit.
    Fairfax said it is too early to predict results for the
full year. Increased borrowings after the recent 320 mln dlr
acquisition of the HSV-Seven television station in Melbourne
will hit earnings but networking with the Channel Sevens in
Sydney and Brisbane will produce some offsetting cost savings.

drop in 1986 net profit to 64.5 mln Swiss francs and said that,
in line with its new, flexible dividend policy, it would cut
its payout to 33 francs per share from 38.
    President Robert Staubli told a news conference that the
first two months of this year gave hope that 1987 profit would
at least equal last year's figure, but said much depended on
outside factors such as fuel prices and the exchange rate.
    The fall was largely due to a 60 mln franc loss on
Swissair's core flying business last year, against a profit of
27 mln francs the previous year, he said.
    The net profit figure was reached after receipt of some 68
mln francs from plane sales, compared with a mere 17 mln francs
in 1985. Finance Head Martin Juenger said he expected around 20
mln francs from sales this year, although said much depended on
the speed with which it decided to sell its DC-10s.
    Gross profit for 1986 reached 340.5 mln francs, with 276
mln francs subtracted for ordinary depreciation.
    Gross profits for the previous year had been 382.5 mln
francs, with 314 mln subtracted for depreciation, including 45
mln francs supplementary depreciation.
    Staubli said the 1986 result, well below predictions made
this time last year, suffered considerably due to exchange rate
fluctuations, in particular the strength of the Swiss franc.
    While the negative effects on revenue of the sharp drop in
the dollar were partially compensated for by cheaper fuel
prices, there was no such offset for the strength of the franc
against other European currencies.
    "Income and profit generated by services to these countries
shrank by a very substantial margin," he said. "Exchange rate
trends therefore hit us much more severely than most other
airlines."

said earnings in first half year 1986/87 were "satisfactory"
despite burdens caused by the dollar's weakness against the
mark and stagnating domestic demand.
    In its semi-annual shareholders' report, Porsche said first
half turnover fell six pct to 1.71 billion marks from 1.83
billion in the same period of 1985/86.
    However, earnings were satisfactory, it said, without
giving absolute figures.
    Domestic turnover fell 26 pct to 283 mln marks from 380
mln.
    Foreign turnover dipped to 1.43 billion marks from 1.45
billion in the first half of last year, although the export
quota rose to 83 pct from 79 pct.
    The car sector accounted for 1.51 billion marks of
turnover, against 1.63 billion the year earlier, it said.
    Production dropped five pct to 25,876 cars from 27,381.
Manufacture of the 911 and 928 models rose six pct to 11,122
from 10,533 units but production of 924 and 944 models was cut
by 12 pct to 14,754 units from 16,848 and would be cut further,
the report said.
    Car sales fell four pct to 25.269 units from 26,414 in the
comparable half year, the report said. U.S. Demand continued
for all models but demand fell in other markets.
    Domestic sales were 39 pct down at 3,267 units from 5,397,
while sales abroad rose five pct to 22,002 from 21,017. Share
of exports in sales rose to 87 pct from 80 pct.
    Investments were reduced to 108 mln marks from 125 mln.
    Earnings were hit by lower sales and by the lower value of
the dollar and currencies in other important markets.
    Nevertheless, sales and turnover would finish the July 11
year at a "high level," Porsche said.

<DBCG.F> expects profits to rise in the current financial year
ending September 9 although the earnings level is still
unsatisfactory, managing board chairman Helmut Wiehn said.
    He told a news conference that business during the year had
weakened somewhat but was still generally positive.
    Sales during the first five months to February was 1.26
billion marks, 46.7 pct down from the same 1985/86 period.
However, he expected turnover for the year to be approximately
unchanged from the previous year's 5.14 billion marks when
current orders from major projects are booked.
    Wiehn said incoming orders in the first five months to end-
February totalled 2.50 billion marks compared with 2.04 billion
for the same period in 1985/86. They included a 45.8 pct
increase in domestic orders to 1.57 billion marks.
    Orders in hand for the five months were 16.7 pct higher at
8.64 billion marks.
    Wiehn added that Babcock was still aiming for a three pct
yield on turnover. In the year to September 1986 group profits
totalled 39 mln marks on sales of 5.14 billion against the
previous year's 32 mln on 5.11 billion marks.
    Parent company turnover was unchanged at 25.6 mln marks.
    Wiehn said Babcock's liquidity had clearly improved in the
current business year, with financial reserves in the first
five months rising by 237 mln marks to 831 mln after increasing
by 408 mln marks to 594 mln in 1985/86.
    He said pre-tax earnings per share for 1985/86, according
to the DVFA method, were 26.95 marks from 21.40 marks and
earnings after tax rose to 10 marks from 8.10.
    The company earlier said dividend will be unchanged at
three marks for ordinary shares and 3.50 marks for preference
shares.

Industries Inc said the company estimates 1986 earnings to be
between 800,000 and 900,000 dlrs, or 22 to 25 cts per share,
compared with 852,000 dlrs, or 33 cts per share, during 1985.
    The company said preliminary estimates of 1986 revenues is
24.5 mln dlrs, compared with 7,900,000 for 1985.
    The estimated 1986 results are based on 3,207,000 shares
outstanding, compared to 2,566,000 shares outstanding for 1985.
    R. Steven Lutterbach, chairman, said net income for 1986
was adversely affected primarily due to lower operating margins
at the company's Western Environmental subsidiary, and to an
increase in bad debt reserves.
    Western Environmental was acquired in March 1986.
Lutterbach explained the company has taken steps to improve
financial and accounting controls, primarily at Western, which
were not adequate at the time of acquisition.
    He noted the final results for the fourth quarter will
depend on the allocation of increased costs between the second
and fourth quarters.
    Lutterbach said it is possible second quarter results will
be restated, though final net income for the year will remain
in the estimated range.
    He added preliminary indications for first quarter 1987
revenues were favorable.

earnings for the third quarter ended February 28, said a strong
performance by its Foods Group was offset by Restaurants Group
declines.
    Excluding unusual items, it said restaurants operating
profit was down in the quarter 12 pct from a year ago as sales
rose four pct.
    It said Burger King USA and Bennigan's reported higher
operating profit, but profits fell sharply at Steak and Ale,
which introduced a new menu.
    Pillsbury also reported lower profits at Distron, Burger
King's distribution arm, and said increased investment spending
on developing concepts - QuikWok, Bay Street and Key West Grill
- hurt results.
    It said Foods operating profit, excluding unusual items,
rose 10 pct with international operations and domestic breads
and baking products major contributors to improvement in the
quarter.
    A turnaround in grain merchandising was a major factor in
profit improvement for the nine months, Pillsbury said.
    Pillsbury said corporate expense showed a 4.3 mln dlr
profit in the quarter reflecting a 10.5 mln dlr gain on the
sale of a joint interest in an Australian food company and
lower corporate expenses, largely as a result of an early
retirement program initiated a year ago.
    Earlier, Pillsbury reported fourth quarter earnings of 48.5
mln dlrs, or 56 cts a share, down from 55.4 mln dlrs, or 63 cts
a share a year ago. Sales advanced to 1.53 billion dlrs from
1.46 billion dlrs.
    Pillsbury said loss of investment tax credits under the
1986 Federal Tax Reform Act reduced per-share earnings by nine
cts in the quarter and 19 cts in the nine months.
    As a result of the act, it said its effective income tax
rate rose eight points to 48.1 pct in the quarter and 5.5
percentage points to 49.7 pct for the nine months.

 ]]></BODY><BODY><![CDATA[Texas Commerce Bancshares Inc said that
relatively stable oil prices and the bank's planned merger with
Chemical New York Corp <CHL> would help 1987 earnings increase
from last year's profits of 20 mln dlrs.
    Texas Commerce chairman Ben Love, in an interview with
Reuters, did not elaborate on how much the bank expected
earnings to increase.
    "We would anticipate that this year would be an improvement
over last because we are stronger," Love said, referring to
Texas Commerce's pending 1.19 billion dlr merger with Chemical.
The merger, which may be finalized as early as May 1, will
lower Texas Commerce's cost of funding by an estimated 10 to 15
basis points, Love said.
    The Texas Commerce-Chemical merger is the only acquisition
by a major out-of-state bank since Texas lawmakers approved
interstate banking effective January 1.
    Hard-hit by loan losses in energy and real estate in Texas'
struggling economy, the only major Texas banks able to report
profits in 1986 were Texas Commerce and RepublicBank which
earned 54.0 mln dlrs. Allied Bancshares Inc <ALBN> lost 17.6
mln dlrs, MCorp <M> lost 82.1 mln dlrs, InterFirst lost 326.5
mln dlrs and First City Bancorporation <FBT>, which is actively
seeking a merger or other form of new capital, lost 402.0 mln
dlrs.
    Love said Texas Commerce had turned the corner on its
energy loan portfolio problems, but added that the bank's
nonperforming real estate loans may increase during 1987.
    "I think the tidal wave in energy has passed over us," he
said. "The fact that the real estate market is still moving
away suggests there could be some continuing growth of
nonperforming loans."
    In 1986, about 42 pct of Texas Commerce's net loan losses
related to real estate lending and 13 pct was due to energy
loan losses. That compares to 1985 when only 17 pct of the
bank's losses were in real estate and energy accounted for 43
pct.
    More than half of Texas Commerce's nonperforming loans,
which totaled 968 mln dlrs at yearend 1986, up from 840 mln
dlrs the year before, were in real estate.
    Love said he believed the real estate loan problems for
Texas Commerce and other major state banks would peak by the
third or fourth quarter of 1987. Absorption of empty office
buildings in Houston, which has a current vacancy rate of about
30 pct, will be a gradual process that could take up to four
years, he said.
    "I think we may be beginning to stabilize this economy. Oil
at 18 dlrs a barrel brings much more confidence than 10 dlrs a
barrel," he said.
    Texas Commerce will retain its name as a separate
subsidiary of Chemical and plans to aggressively expand its
holdings throughout Texas, offering additional products to
build up its consumer banking business, Love said. "We are
resuming what we did best for years -- an offensive position,"
he said.
    In January, Texas Commerce acquired a failed bank in
Montgomery County, adjacent to the Houston metropolitan area,
and earlier this month opened a new bank in San Antonio. Texas
Commerce plans to add more banks in San Antonio and in the
Dallas-Fort Worth area where it currently has only 16 member
banks, he said.
    One day after the Texas Commerce acquisition was announced
in December, InterFirst Corp <IFC> and RepublicBank Corp <RPT>,
both headquartered in Dallas, agreed to merge in a deal valued
at 570 mln dlrs.
    The combination of former archrivals RepublicBank and
InterFirst, giving the two banks a virtual lock on the Dallas
banking market, has not changed Texas Commerce's expansion
plans for the state's second-largest city, Love said. "We think
we can try to get a little part of their roost," he said.
    The Chemical partnership will also give Texas Commerce an
edge in developing new consumer products, he said.
    "We have always been a wholesale bank but we have more than
one million customers all over the state. Chemical will show us
how to take advantage of enhancing our consumer products," he
said, referring to expansion of such existing products as
credit cards and investment banking.

Quebec, the government agency which manages the province's
pension funds, said its investment portfolio earned a net
profit of almost three billion Canadian dlrs in 1986, an
increase of 300 mln dlrs over 1985.
    The agency said in its annual statement that it had assets
with a total book value of 25 billion dlrs, or a market value
of 28 billion dlrs, at the end of 1986.
    These holdings had a rate of return of 13.5 pct in the
year, which was below the Caisse's average return of 16 pct in
the past four years and 14.2 pct in the past eight years.
    The Caisse said foreign equity investments represented 3.6
pct of total assets, while U.S. government securities accounted
for another 5.2 pct of the overall portfolio.
    The agency's holding of U.S. government securities yielded
a return of 20.7 pct for the year, significantly more than
either the 14.1 pct earned on the total bond portfolio or the
13.5 pct for all funds under management.
    "These high liquidity securities, which are held on a
temporary basis and for purposes of strategy and the protection
of the overall bond portfolio, have been efficient," the agency
said of the U.S. securities.
    The agency said it has 7.9 billion dlrs invested in
Canadian private sector businesses after channeling 965 mln
dlrs of new funds into this area in 1986.
    The Caisse said it acquired 825 mln of new Government of
Quebec bonds and 342 mln dlrs of new securities from other
Quebec government issuers during the year.

concern based in Vasteras, Sweden, said it expects 1987
earnings, after financial income and expense, to be flat
compared with 1986, when it earned 2.53 billion Swedish crowns,
or 371.1 mln dlrs.
    A company spokesman said 1986 results were boosted
significantly by the booking of two large orders for nuclear
power plants.
    This gain, he said, will be balanced in 1987 by a return to
profitability by Asea's power transmission segment, which had a
loss of 183 mln crowns, or 26.9 mln dlrs, last year.
    Currency conversions were made at 6.81 crowns to the dlr.
    The spokesman said the company has built up a strong
backlog of orders that will contribute to earnings in 1988 and
beyond.
    At yearend 1986, Asea's order backlog stood at 32.7 billion
crowns, or 4.8 billion dlrs, up from 30.9 billion, or 4.5
billion dlrs, at the end of 1985.
    Asea has operations in power generation and transmission,
transportation equipment, pollution control and robotics.
    Total sales in 1986 were 46 billion crowns, or 6.8 billion
dlrs.

its first quarter fiscal 1987 net earnings would improve by 10
mln dlrs over the same period a year ago.
    The company said 1987 got off on a much better footing than
fiscal 1986, from which the company recorded a loss of 67.6 mln
dlrs, or 6.28 dlrs per share, on revenues of 641.4 mln dlrs.
    James Sherwood, president of the company, said he expects
to record a loss of approximately 12 mln dlrs for the first
quarter, compared to losses of approximately 22 mln dlrs for
first quarter fiscal 1986.
    The company emphasized the first quarter is a traditionally
slow period for the ferry industry, which is  part of Sea
Containers' business.
    Sherwoood said the company's losses were largely
attributable to non-recurring events and provisions. He cited
the default of 15 container leasees and ship charterers,
costing the company approximately 25 mln dlrs.
    He also cited a 23 mln dlr cost as a result of a closing
two of its subsidiary's ferry services, and a 10.3 mln dlr
provision to cover losses on the sale of container assets and
severance pay costs.

1987 pre-tax income could be reduced by about 33.5 mln dlrs if
it decides to reclassify its 339 mln dlrs in medium- to
long-term loans to Brazil as nonperforming.
    But the company stressed in a filing with the Securities
and Exchange Commission that it believes it is too soon to
reclassify the debt, despite Brazil's Feb 20 suspension of
direct interest payments on medium- and long-term loans.
    "The corporation believes that it is premature to make a
decsion to classify such medium- and long-term debt as
nonperforming at this time," First Interstate said.
    But First Interstate said that if Brazil's suspension of
interest payments continues, it may have to reclassify its
loans as nonperforming and place them on non-accrual, meaning
that interest previously accrued but not paid would be deducted
from net income and interest would no longer be accrued.
    Besides its medium- and long-term debt, First Interstate
said it also has 165 mln dlrs in short-term loans or trade
lines in Brazil.
    As of Dec 31, 1986, nonperforming Brazilian outstandings
were about 4.1 mln dlrs, it said.

(SPRJ.J) chairman Henri de Villiers said he could not predict
profits for the bank this year because of South Africa's
continuing political unrest.
    De Villiers also warned in the annual report that "failing
prompt and decisive political action, South Africa faces a
future of violent deadlock between different racial and
political groupings." 
    He said South Africa's future economic prospects are
"clouded by political and social issues and in the absence of
evidence that these are being positively addressed I am unable
to offer an earnings forecast for 1987."
    Standard Bank, 39 pct owned by Standard Chartered PLC
 <STCH.L>, London, previously reported that 1986 net income
rose by 13.8 pct to 209.0 mln rand.
    The bank said its bad debt losses should begin to decline
this year "although it may take some time before they return to
accepted industry norms."
    The annual report showed that the bank's charge for bad and
doubtful debts rose in 1986 to 187.6 mln rand from 162.1 mln
rand in the prior year.
    The bank said net income of its Standard Bank of South
Africa subsidiary declined 8.2 pct in 1986 to 112.3 mln rand in

right will entitle its holder to purchase, at the right's
then-current exercise price, a number of the acquiring
company's common shares having a market value at that time of

    The dividend distribution will be made March 31, 1987,
payable to shareholders of record on that date. The rights will
expire ten years later on March 31, 1987, the company said.
    Pubco said the rights are not being distributed in response

sharply this morning after analyst Daniel Lee of Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc reiterated his recommendation of the stock, traders
said.
    McDonald's, an operator of fast food restaurants, rose
1-5/8 to 77-3/8.
    "Comparable store sales are up 5.6 pct in 1986 vs 1985,"
Lee said, "and the stock is trading below the market multiple."
He said "not many companies have a consistent 15 pct annual
earnings growth rate, return on equity above 20 pct, but trade
at less than the market multiple."
    Analyst Lee said "the introduction of a new line of salads
this spring, at about the time we are all trying to squeeze
into bathing suits, should boost sales."
    He also noted that "the average McDonald's does about 1.369
mln dlrs in revenues a year. That compares with 1.1 mln dlrs a
year for the average Burger King and 800,000 dlrs a year for
the average Wendy's." Since it cost about the same to build a
single store for any one of these chains, he said, "McDonald's
can well justify their expansion."
    Lee expects McDonald's to earn 4.40 dlrs a share in 1986
and 5.15 dlrs in 1988. Last year it earned 3.72 dlrs a share.

not plan to reduce its regular quarterly dividend of 30 cts a

    "It has been the intent to set the dividend at a level so
that it could be sustained through the ups and downs of the
business cycle," Olson told a meeting of securities analysts.
    "We see no reason to change that policy," he said.
    Although ATT will maintain its current dividend, Olson said
the company wants to decrease the percentage of earnings paid
in dividends by increasing earnings.
    Industry analysts had speculated that ATT might cut its
common dividend, especially after the company posted a fourth
quarter net loss of 1.17 billion dlrs and earned only five cts

    The loss included a one-time restructuring charge of 1.7

from 51-pct-owned liquor producer Hiram Walker-Gooderham and
Worts in the current fiscal year ending in early March, 1988,
chairman Derrick Holden-Brown said in a speech prepared for
delivery to Toronto analysts.
    "We anticipate that Hiram Walker profits will be well above
those of the plateau years," he said, referring to the four
years up to 1985.
    "In other words, we will have regained the 1985 position
and improved on it," Holden-Brown said.
    Allied-Lyons won control of Hiram Walker-Gooderham last
year in a battle against Gulf Canada Corp, which finally got a
49 pct stake after an out-of-court settlement.
    Hiram Walker Resources Ltd, the previous owner, reported
liquor profits of 282 mln Canadian dlrs in the fiscal year
ending Sept. 30, 1985, 278 mln dlrs in 1984, 267 mln in 1983,

    Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons' financial results for the
fiscal year just ended March seven would include three months
of Hiram Walker-Gooderham profits, but he did not provide
actual figures.
    He said Hiram Walker-Gooderham's profit improvement in the

said the company will record higher earnings in the first
quarter and for the full year.
    Addressing analysts, Tsai said "First quarter results have
been extremely encouraging and results for all of 1987 will
show significant improvement over 1986."
    American Can earned 196.3 mln dlrs, or 3.21 dlrs per share,
adjusted for a two-for-one stock split, in 1986.
    In the 1986 first quarter, the company reported net income
of 67.5 mln dlrs, including one-time gains from sale of assets,
or 2.30 dlrs per share, before the stock adjustment.
    In the 1987 first quarter, American Can will record a
one-time gain of 28 cts per share from the sale of shares in
its Musicland Group subsidiary. The gain is slightly higher
than the expected gain the company predicted in February
because additional shares of the unit were sold.
    In response to a question, Tsai said American Can's
investment in Jefferies and Co is "very small".
    "We treat it as just another passive investment," he said.
According to press reports, American Can owns 20 pct of
Jefferies and is its largest single shareholder.
    Yesterday, Boyd Jefferies, chairman and founder of the
brokerage firm bearing his name, resigned from the firm and
said he would plead guilty to two felony charges for breaking
securities laws.
    Responding to another question, Tsai said AIDS-related
claims were a small portion of claims made with American Can's
insurance subsidiaries in 1986.

said the water-clarity problem delaying the removal of fuel
from the damaged Unit Two of the Three Mile Island nuclear
power plant appears to have been resolved.
    The company said the slower than expected removal of the
fuel, which has been primarily due to the water-clarity
problems, is now expected to extend fuel removal into 1988.
    A spokesman said the company had previously expected this
to be completed by the end of 1987 and has not estimated how
far into 1988 the process will extend. It still expects to
complete the entire clean-up by the end of 1988, he added.
    GPU said its auditors, Coopers and Lybrand, again qualified
its opinion of GPU's financial statements, adding the recovery
of TMI-2 decommissioning costs to the unresolved issues leading
to the qualified opinion.
    GPU said its operating subsidiaries will seek to recover
the costs of decommissioning TMI-2 in future rate proceedings.
    As in past years, the qualified opinion continues to list
other uncertainties associated with the accident, which damaged
TMI-2 -- the recovery of cleanup costs and any payments for
damages that might exceed available insurance proceeds.

    He told a meeting of securities analysts that, although the

    Olson said ATT's cash flow was "very strong in the first

substantial growth in the second half of fiscal 1987 ended
March 7, chairman Derrick Holden-Brown said in answer to
reporters' queries.
    "You will certainly see substantial growth in Allied-Lyons
in the second half," Holden-Brown said following a presentation
to Toronto securities analysts.
    Holden-Brown declined to say whether second half growth in
profit before taxes would exceed the 20.7 pct rise reported in
the first half. Allied-Lyons had first half profit of 148.0 mln
stg, up from 122.6 mln stg in the prior year.
    Allied-Lyons will also have a full year extraordinary cost
of slightly more than seven mln stg for defence costs
associated with Elders IXL Ltd's failed take-over bid for the
company, Holden-Brown also said.
    But that cost will be more than offset by an extraordinary
gain of about 60 mln stg on Allied-Lyons' sale of its 24.9 pct
interest in Australian brewers Castlemaine Toohey, he said.
    "So with Australians, you win some and you lose some. But
hopefully you win them all in the end," Holden-Brown said.
    Asked if he thought Allied-Lyons is vulnerable to other
take-over attempts, Holden-Brown replied: "No, I don't."
    "We must never be complacent and we must always be very
watchful, but I think we would be very expensive," he said.
    Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons' share price to corporate
earnings ratio is now comparable with other leading companies
in the food and beverage industry.
    "That was not the case two years ago. If the Australians had
come a little bit earlier, they might have had more luck, I
think," Holden-Brown said.
    Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons' move to acquire Hiram
Walker-Gooderham and Worts Ltd in March, 1986 during Elders
take-over bid for the company was "100 pct a growth action."
    "We knew when we did it that it could be misconstrued, and
that people almost inevitably would say (the acquisition was)
defensive, but it never was," Holden-Brown told reporters.
    Asked by securities analysts if Allied-Lyons plans a share
issue in Canada after acquiring a 51 pct interest in Hiram
Walker, Holden-Brown responded: "Plan might be too strong a
word. But I must say I do feel the need for Allied-Lyons to be
better known in Canada."

    For 1986, Niagara Mohawk's earnings per share fell to 2.71

    The company said earnings reduced primarily as a result of

<AZPI.MI>, reporting a 14.6 pct rise in provisional 1986 net
profit, said it carried seven pct more passengers on domestic
routes last year, but 11.5 pct fewer passengers on flights from
North America and Canada.
    Alitalia said the drop in North American traffic had been
due to a general fall in the numbers of American tourists
visiting Europe caused by fears of terrorism.
    The airline reported provisional net profit rose to 55
billion lire from 48 billion in 1985.
    A spokesman said Alitalia was hoping for an increase in
traffic with the U.S. In 1987.
    It planned to increase the number of flights from Italy to
New York to 19 per week, to reinstate flights to Boston and to
re-open the direct Rome-Milan-Los Angeles service.
    The spokesman announced that from March 29, Alitalia would
be starting a new weekly service to Shanghai.
    For its summer 1987 programme, it would be adding 127 extra
flights to European destinations -- an increase of 27 pct.

said it will raise paid-up capital to comply with the country's
minimum requirement of five mln dinars by drawing on profits
from its operations in the country.
    Jordan's government asked banks in early 1985 to comply
with the new capital requirement -- raised from three mln
dinars -- by the start of 1986.
    Rafidain's Area Manager Adnan Abdul Karim al-Azzawi told
Reuters the branch had now registered its capital at the higher
level but did not say how long it would take to pay it in. The
bank's 1986 balance shows paid-up capital of 3.1 mln dinars.
    Banks in Jordan have generally complied with the higher
capital requirement except Chase Manhattan which decided
instead to close its operation, banking sources said.
    Local banks floated shares to raise extra capital, while
the branches of foreign banks brought in additional cash.
    Banking sources said it appeared that Jordan had made an
exception in Rafidain's case, allowing it longer to comply.
They said the gesture refelcted close political ties between
Jordan and Iraq as well as Baghdad's financial difficulties.
    The Jordan branch saw pre-tax profit rise 80 pct in 1986 to
550,332 dinars on assets of 12.6 mln dinars.

management and financial changes initiated during the 1986/87
business year should cause profits to reach more acceptable
levels in 1987/88 end-February 1.
    Net profit reported earlier fell 85.3 pct in the year ended
February 1.
    Results for the first month of the new year were
encouraging after a period of uncertain consumer confidence and
difficult trading conditions, it said in a statement.
    The Big W discount store division and New South Wales
supermarkets produced very disappointing results, it added.
    Woolworths earlier reported a fall in net profit to 9.27
mln from 63.20 mln on sales of 5.47 billion against 4.83
billion. Capital spending for the year was 119 mln dlrs against
105 mln for the previous year with 50 new stores opened, but
total sales were below target, Woolworths said.
    The company provided 20 mln dlrs against operating profit
for the year to cover mark-downs on stock.
    Extraordinary items included a 53 mln dlr profit on the
sale of properties and investments less a 28 mln provision for
reorganising the Big W chain.
    Woolworths is unrelated to the U.S. Group F.W. Woolworth
<Z.N>. It has been the subject of takeover speculation since
<Industrial Equity Ltd> acquired a 20 pct stake last year.
    New Zealand's diversified investment group <Rainbow Corp
Ltd> bought Safeway Stores Inc's <SA> 20 pct holding in
Woolworths for 190 mln dlrs late last year.
    Safeway put its stake up for tender just in time to take
advantage of changes in U.S. Tax laws effective from the end of
December, informed sources said.
    Woolworths shares closed on Australian stock exchanges
today at 3.50 dlrs, down five cents from Friday.

qualified the company's 1986 financial report.
    The report was qualified due to uncertainties surrounding
the previously announced arbitration award against American
Motors' former subsidiary, AM General Corp. The award is being
contested.
    The report was filed today with the Securities and Exchange
Commission along with a copy of Chrysler Corp's <C> proposal to
take over American Motors.
    American Motors said earlier than an arbitration award,
made to Emerson Electric Co <EMR> in February, amounted to 60
mln dlrs plus legal expenses. American Motors has challenged
the award.
    The automaker sold the AM General unit to LTV Corp <QLTV>
in 1983, the same year it was awarded a five-year, 1.2 billion
dlr procurement contract with the military. LTV and AM General
last year sought protection under Chapter 11.
    The arbitration proceeding was called after Emerson
Electric charged AM General violated an agreement covering the
development of certain components in the contract.
    The components were for the military's "High Mobility
Multi-Purpose Wheeled Vehicle" (HMMWV), American Motors said.
    In selling AM General to LTV, American Motors agreed to
indemnify LTV against losses incurred by LTV resulting from the
Emerson Electric claims.
    AMC also said the award has not been confirmed by a court,
and faces additional legal challenges. It said that, because of
the LTV and Am General reorganizations, the final amount of a
confirmed award and the amount of any loss to LTV is uncertain.

results for its fiscal first quarter to end April four, to
decline from the record earnings of 3.8 mln dlrs or 57 cts a

    The toy manufacturer attributed its anticipated lower
financial results to an an expected moderate decline in
shipments of its Pound Puppies product line.
    Tonka also said it expects revenues and earnings to remain
lower through the 1987 first half compared with 1986 record
results of 125.4 mln dlrs in revenues and 10.3 mln dlrs in net
earnings or 1.47 dlrs a share.
    The company said its level of shipments is good despite a
conservative buying pattern on the part of retailers industry
wide. Tonka's first quarter shipments will be down somewhat
from 1986 record levels and gross profit margins will be down
slightly from a year ago, it said.
    Second half sales are expected to be stronger based on a
return to a more traditional seasonal shipping pattern in which
retailers order and stock conservatively early in the year and
time large shipments for the second half, it said.

expects to pay an unchanged dividend of 13 marks on 1987
earnings but profits will only barely reach last year's record
levels, management board spokesman Maximilian Hackl said.
    He told the annual news conference that possible credit
risks, especially those associated with foreign nations, had
largely been covered. Risk provisions in 1987 were therefore
unlikely to reach the same high level as in 1986.
    Group bank net profit rose to 275.52 mln marks in 1986 from
222.73 mln the previous year and parent bank net profit
increased to 187.63 mln marks from 161.58 mln.
    Hackl said that interest margins in the banking business
had declined to 2.71 pct last year from 2.78 pct the previous
year. But in the mortgage sector, the margins had increased
slightly and stood around 0.7 pct.
    Parent bank commission surplus in the securities business
had risen almost 15 pct to 358 mln marks in 1986.
    Expenses for personnel had increased 7.5 pct to 782 mln
marks and others costs had increased 9.4 pct to 272 mln marks.
    The parent bank's 1986 partial operating profit, which
excludes earnings from trading on its own account, had climbed
two pct to 671 mln marks.
    The parent bank's balance sheet total rose 5.3 pct to 81.5
billion marks at end-1986 compared with end-1985, Hackl said.
    It was boosted by a three billion mark rise in mortgage
business and a 1.1 billion mark increase in banking business.
    The mortgage sector's share in total parent bank business
volume rose to 46 pct from 45.
    Hackl said that in January and February this year, the
bank's credit business had not livened up. But despite the
sharp downturn on German bourses, profits from trading on own
account had increased in the first two 1987 months compared
with the same year-ago period. He gave no detailed figures.

which will be sold to the private sector in the second half of
this year, reported increased profits for last year.
    Societe Generale, one of the three largest state-owned
banking groups, said in a statement that its parent company
profit for 1986 totalled 800 mln francs, up 21.2 pct on 1985's
660 mln profit.
    This was in line with earlier forecasts of profit of
between 770 and 800 mln francs.
    The bank's parent company gross operating profits were up
5.4 pct at 21.34 billion francs against 20.24 billion in 1985.
    The increase in the bank's gross operating profits was
mostly due to a rise in french franc deposits and personal
loans as well as the development of its financial activities,
Societe Generale said.
    Parent company net banking earnings last year were also up
at 13.9 billion francs compared with 13.57 billion in 1985
while operating costs totalled 7.44 billion francs against 6.67

hit by a two-year earnings slump, should begin a come-back by
the end of 1987 and post strong growth in 1988, analyst Rick
Martin of Sanford C. Bernstein Co Inc said.
    "There will be increasing momentum in earnings, albeit not
until later this year," Martin said at a technology conference
sponsored by the investment firm.
    Martin said the coming rebound reflects new product
introductions in the mid-range area, rather than any drastic
improvement in economic growth or U.S. capital spending.
    IBM, whose stock hit a 52-week low of 115-3/4 dlrs in
mid-January, has come back lately. IBM was trading up 7/8 at
149-1/2 dlrs.
    Analysts, computer industry executives, and the company
itself, have highlighted the external economic factors
hampering IBM's growth.
    But Martin said the product cycle was key to understanding
the rise and fall of IBM and other computer companies, and
pointed to Digital Equipment Corp <DEC> to support his view.
"By replacing the product line, earnings have soared," he said
of DEC's line of VAX computers.
    In contrast to DEC, IBM faultered with an incompatible
mid-range product line. A new computer code-named "Fort Knox"
was supposed to tie together a number of IBM's mid-range
systems, but the product never got off the ground, he said.
    Instead, aspects of the computer were integrated into the
IBM 9370 machine introduced last year, and other aspects should
be unwrapped by 1988, Martin said. "The major story will be a
rebound in its mid-range business."
    He said sales of IBM's mid-range computers fell about 13
pct in 1986. But the new products will lead to 5.8 pct growth
in mid-range computers this year and 30.7 pct growth in 1988.
    High-end computers, primarily the Sierra line, are coming
to the end of their product life cycle. Although growing 22.5
pct in the midst of IBM's sharply lower 1986 year, growth will
drop to 1.5 pct in 1987 and 1.9 pct in 1988, he said.
    By 1988, overall revenue growth should rise to about 16
pct, against 5.8 pct growth in 1987 and 2.4 pct in 1986, Martin
said. Last year, IBM earned 4.8 billion dlrs on revenues of
51.3 billion dlrs.
    Investors asked what this all meant to DEC, whose earnings
and stock have been propelled by a strong slew of product
introductions in the mid-range area.
    In response, Martin said he did not view IBM as a threat to
DEC, nor DEC as a threat to IBM, because both companies were
catering largely to existing customer bases, rather than
stealing market share from one another.

quarter sales to be up "dramatically" and profits to "do well,"
chairman and president Jack Reichert said after a securities
analysts meeting.
    He declined to be more specific.
    In the 1986 first quarter, Brunswick reported earnings of
23.8 mln dlrs or 57 cts a share on sales of 396.7 mln dlrs.
    Reichart noted that results of its two newly-acquired boat
manufacturing companies will be included in the company's first
quarter report.
    Brunswick expects its recreation centers to benefit from
increased attention to the sport of bowling resulting from
acceptance in the 1988 Summer Olympics of bowling as an
exhibition sport and as a medal sport in the 1991 Pan American
Games, he said.
    He said field testing of a new bowling concept involving
electronic features is being readied for test marketing this
summer, and if successful, could "materially benefit"
operations.
    Brunswick is currently test marketing in California a
health club facility adjoining a bowling center, he said.
    Turning to its defense operations, Reichert said he expects
the division to receive significant contracts in the near
future. At 1986 year end, Brunswick's defense contract backlog
stood at 425 mln dlrs.
    Frederick Florjancic, vice president-finance, told analysts
Brunswick was disappointed two credit rating services recently
downgraded the company's debt which stood at about 665.4 mln
dlrs at 1986 year end.
    "We are confident we can service our debt and bring it down
in the very near term," based on strong cash flow from
Brunswick's expanded boat operations, Florjancic said.
    Shareholders at the company's April 27 annual shareholders
meeting will be asked to approve an increase in the authorized
common shares outstanding to 200 mln from 100 mln shares, a
company spokesman said.

revised results for the year ended October 31 to a loss of 61.7
mln dlrs, or 2.33 dlrs per share, down from the
previously-reported loss of 12.1 mln dlrs, or 46 cts per share.
    The restatement was made because of change in the method of
accounting for a combination of several company-controlled
concerns that resulted in a 53.5 mln dlr charge, Cooper
Development said.
    Last August Cooper Development combined its Cooper
Biomedical Inc unit and its Cooper Laboratories subsidiary with
Technicon Instruments Corp, a company acquired from Revlon Inc
<REV>, a Cooper spokesman said.
    The spokesman said the transaction was accounted for as an
acquisition, but the Securities and Exchange Commission took
issue with the accounting method and said it should be
accounted for as a reorganization of entities under common
control.
    This treatment requires that the costs associated with the
transaction be expanded rather than capitalized as an
intangible asset, the company said.
    It also said that, since the charged required an expensing
of previously accrued liabilities, the company will experience
no resulting material change it its cash flow.

 ]]></BODY><BODY><![CDATA[US Sprint, the 50-50 telephone venture
of GTE Corp <GTE> and United Telecommunications Inc <UT> set up
last June, is optimistic despite expecting to report a net loss
of about 500 mln dlrs this year.
     David M. Holland, president of US Sprint's Dallas-based
Southwest Division, told Reuters in an interview that he did
not know what it would report for the first quarter, but agreed
that for the year the company should have about the same
results as last year when it lost "about 500 mln dlrs."
     He noted the company was slated to spend 2.3 billion dlrs
over "two plus years" to set up its network.

    Holland added that Sprint was still paying almost 500 mln
dlrs a year to American Telephone and Telegraph Co (T) in order
to lease its lines.
     He said 16,000 miles of its 23,000 mile fiber optic
telephone line are now "in the ground," and 7,000 miles are
operable.
     By the end of the year, he said, 90 pct of the company's
subscribers will be carried on its fiber optic lines (instead
of leased ATT lines), compared with 60 pct by the end of the
second quarter.
    Fiber optic lines, which send digital light impulses along
microscopic glass lines, is quicker, more accurate and more
economical than traditional copper cables. A fiber optic line
the diameter of a dime can carry the same amount of information
as a copper cable 20 feet in diameter.
     "By the end of the year, we will have the capacity to
carry 50 pct of all U.S. long distance phone calls," Holland
said.
    He said ATT currently controls about 80 pct of the U.S.
long distance market, with MCI Communications Corp <MCIC> about
10 to 12 pct and Sprint five to seven pct.
     Holland said Sprint's rates, which were 50 pct lower than
ATT when it did not pay to gain access to local telephone
exchanges, were now about 10 to 12 pct lower now that all the
companies have equal access. He said the company was cutting
back its advertising by about 30 pct this year.
     At the same time, he said Sprint had increased its total
number of customers to four mln from two mln from July 1986 to
last January.
    "We've captured the fiber high ground, shown the importance
of it," he said.
     Concerning the deregulation of ATT, Holland said he
believed ATT "should be given some flexibility, but should be
regulated on pricing plans."
     "They're so dominant in the market place," he said, adding
that ATT should be deregulated when "there is true competition
in the marketplace."
     "It takes time to prove ourselves and a lot of money," he
said, adding, "maybe two to four years out, it's hard to say."
    Holland said he was not concerned about talk that Sprint's
two owners might be squabbling or that corporate raiders, such
as the Belzberg family in Canada, might be putting pressure on
them to sell off their loss-making Sprint holdings.
     "They are two excellent partners who have stated time and
time again their support of US Sprint," he said, adding that he
was "amazed" at industry talk that the two companies might be
arguing. "There's no evidence of that," he said.
     He said Sprint's progress in such areas as revenues,
number of customers and construction was on track, even "ahead
in many areas."
    Looking beyond the United States, Holland said Sprint
currently had direct access to 34 countries and aimed to be in
90 pct of the Free World nations by 1988.
    "We want to be in every country that ATT serves," he said.
    He said Sprint currently does not have access to Mexico but
was working on it.
     He noted negotiations between Mexico and GTE Sprint, the
forerunner of US Sprint, had been broken off by the September
1985 earthquake which had devastated the nation's telephone
network.

likely to show a more than 20 pct rise in 1986 operating
profits when it reports results tomorrow, reflecting gains in
its aviation and property businesses, share analysts said.
    Analysts polled by Reuters estimated after-tax profits from
operations will be between 1.525 billion and 1.8 billion dlrs
compared with 1.23 billion in 1985.
    They also said Swire will have an extraordinary gain of
about 1.38 billion dlrs from the flotation of its Cathay
Pacific Airways Ltd <CAPH.HKG> unit last May.
    Swire had an extraordinary gain of 59.1 mln dlrs in 1985.
    Share analysts said Swire will set a 36 cent final dividend
for its "A" shares, making a total of 54 cents, after 47 cents
adjusted for a two-for-one bonus issue in 1985.
    Aviation and properties together account for 75 pct of the
company's net asset value and about 85 pct of its net profits,
analysts said.
    The company's aviation division consists of its majority
stake in Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd and its 25 pct interest in
<Hongkong Aircraft Engineering Co Ltd>, which is also 25 pct
owned by Cathay.
    Cathay last week reported 1986 profits climbed to 1.23
billion dlrs from 777 mln in 1985, partly because of lower fuel
costs and greater traffic.
    Swire's share of Cathay, which stood at 70 pct before the
flotation, fell to 54.25 pct at the end of last year and has
since slipped to 50.23 pct.
    Hongkong Aircraft reported this month its 1986 net profits
rose 29.5 pct to 115.5 mln dlrs.
    Tony Measor, an analyst at Hong Leong Securities Ltd,
estimates Swire's profits will be 1.525 billion dlrs.
    "Much depends on properties," said Measor. "And they did a lot
better in the second half of the year."
    Estimates of profits from the firm's wholly owned Swire
Properties Ltd unit range widely from 500 mln dlrs to 700 mln
compared with 570 mln dlrs in 1985.
    Swire Properties recorded an interim profit of 120 mln dlrs
for the first half of 1986, well below 260 mln dlrs for the
same 1985 period, but analysts said that was due mainly to the
low level of completion of new residential flats. The firm's
properties consist mainly of the Taikoo Shing residential
development and two luxury housing projects.
    Hoare Govett Asia Ltd said the completion of 1,100 flats in
Taikoo Shing will have yielded profits of 300 mln dlrs in
second-half 1986.
    During the year property prices continued to rise as more
people bought real estate, benefiting from low interest rates,
analysts said.
    "At the end of last year, flats in Taikoo Shing were selling
at 1,100 dlrs per square foot, up by about 20 pct from a year
ago," said Frederick Tsang of Mansion House Securities (F.E.)
Ltd.
    Swire is developing a large commercial and hotel complex in
the central business district of Hong Kong but it will not
provide income until the first stage is completed next year.
    The company also sold three properties and a part interest
in a proposed hotel development, which should result in
extraordinary gains of 60 mln dlrs in 1986, according to James
Capel (Far East) Ltd.
    Swire's trading and manufacturing operations are expected
to earn 300 mln dlrs, up 22 pct from 1985 but its shipping and
offshore services are likely to post a small loss of about 10
mln dlrs because of depressed market conditions.

earlier announced a 1986 pre-tax profits rise of 42 pct over
1985, said its prospects for growth were very exciting.
    The profit figure of 115.3 mln stg exceeded a forecast by
some 10 pct made during the hostile bid by Dixons Group Plc
<DXNS.L> last year and the company said the results were a
major step towards the aim of making Woolworth the most
profitable retailing group in the U.K.
    It aimed to produce growth from all its businesses and look
for opportunities to acquire specialist retail businesses.
    Earlier this month the group said that tentative merger
talks with the high street pharmacist <Underwoods Plc> had been
called off and recently announced a 19.2 mln stg recommended
offer for <Charlie Browns Car Part Centres Plc>.
    The B and Q Do it Yourself centres raised sales by 31 pct
and retail profit by 37 pct, with its pretax contribution of
45.5 mln making it the largest single component.
    The company said that the improvement had been achieved by
substantial organic growth in existing stores as well as by the
opening of a further 29 new outlets and enhanced margins.
    In other sectors, the Comet electrical chain raised retail
profits by 46 pct to 17.4 mln stg, while the Woolworth chain
reported a 120 pct improvement to 38.7 mln.
    The company said its property operations would increase
substantially following the start of a joint venture deal with
developers <Rosehaugh Plc>.
    The defence costs against the 1.9 billion stg bid from
Dixons resulted in a 16.0 mln stg extraordinary charge.
    The results were 10 mln stg up on most analysts forecasts.
As a result, the group's shares rose strongly, peaking at 865p
from last night's 842p before easing to 860p at 1155 GMT.

to continuing manufacturing difficulties at its AlloyTek Inc
jet engine component subsidiary, it expects to report a net

quarter ended January 31.
    It said revenues for the period were about 11.9 mln dlrs,
about even with those of a year earlier.
    For the full fiscal year, the company said it earned about
775,000 dlrs or 34 cts per share, down from 1,402,000 dlrs or
76 cts per share a year before.
    The company said an unexpectedly large volume of customer
inquiries at its Spitz Inc simulation products subsidiary has
caused higher than expected business development outlays.
    The company said it expects significant contract awards to
Spitz later this year.
    It said it has started implementing a plan to progressively
reduce manufacturing costs at AlloyTek over the next several
quarters.  The company said it may move AlloyTek's plant from
Grandville, Mich., to a lower labor cost area.
    The company said it discovered the extent of the AlloyTek
problems during a year-end review of subcontracts and related
work in progress for production of jet engine components for
General Electric Co <GE>.
    It said it will release annual results around April 15.

<VOLV.ST> has a 48 pct stake, said it was proposing a
two-for-five stock issue that will raise the company's equity
capital to 420 mln crowns from 300 mln.
    Catena reported profits after financial income and costs up
to only 231 mln crowns from 207 mln in 1985, despite an
increase in sales to 8.54 billion crowns from 5.59 billion in
1985.
    The company said that its 1986 performance was best
reflected by earnings after writeoffs, which rose to 310 mln
from 221 mln in 1985.
    Catena's increase in sales was mainly due to the takeover
of Safveans AB in February 1986, which changed the business
profile of Catena. It had principally operated as a Volvo
dealer. With the Safveans acquisition it is now mainly a
trading and industrial company.
    In December 1986 Catena sold its share in the stockbroking
firm Jacobson och Ponsbach Fondkommission AB. This yielded a
profit of 386.7 mln crowns and was reflected in Catena's
pre-tax earnings which rose to 724 mln crowns from 204 mln in
1985.

said improved results at its Semiconductor Group helped reduce
losses in the third quarter and nine months.
    In the quarter ended March 8, the group had a modest sales
increase and major improvement in operating performance
compared to the year-ago quarter, the company said.
    But results softened from the prior quarter because of low
bookings last fall for third quarter shipment and holiday
shutdowns, it said.
    The semiconductor maker cut net losses to 25.6 mln dlrs or
31 cts a share from 39.4 mln dlrs or 47 cts in the quarter.
    Losses in the nine months were reduced to 32.7 mln dlrs or
44 cts from 84.4 mln dlrs or one dlr. Sales grew 23.5 pct in
the quarter to 398.1 mln dlrs and 25.5 pct in the nine months
to 1.36 billion dlrs.
    Bookings recovered in the latter part of the third quarter,
the company said. Despite the improvement in order rates and
operating results year-to-year, pricing continues to be
"aggressive for many products," it said.
    Nevertheless, it expects the semiconductor business will
continue to improve this year. The Information Systems Group
will continue strong sales growth based on recent order trends

earlier announced a 62 pct rise in 1986 pre-tax profits, said
it had recorded its best general insurance result for six years
but had not reached satisfactory levels of profit in other
areas.
    Group Chief Executive Brian Corby told a news conference
that despite returning to trading profits, the International
division and the Mercantile and General division had not
reached satisfactory levels.
    But he said he welcomed Mercantile and General trading
profits in 1986 and was optimistic about both that and the
International division.
    The acquisition of the U.S. Life company <Jackson National>
had a small effect in 1986 but its full effect would be felt in
the 1987 results, Corby said.
    The Group also intended to expand the number of its estate
agency firms bought last year, and hoped they will comprise
between 10 and 15 pct of total company profits in the future.
    "We hope they will be very profitable very shortly. We are
looking for profits from the estate agencies themselves as well
as the insurance products associated with them," Corby said.
    Prudential's pre-tax profits rose from 1985's 110.1 mln stg
to 178.1 mln stg in 1986.

restructuring of its balance sheet that will include a
write-off of between 39 mln and 43 mln dlrs, most of which
would be intangible goodwill from the company's past
acquisitions.
    The company said the remainder of its write-off would
include a one-time expense for future costs related to early
retirement programs, office consolidations and an increase in
the general reserve for adjustments and contingencies.
    Bruce Wilkinson, president of the company, said the charges
to the company's third quarter earnings, for the period ending
March 31, would "significantly impact" third quarter results
but would not affect the company's cash position.
    "We expect to have the biggest operating backlog in the
company's history by June 30, 1987, the end of our fiscal
year," Wilkinson said. "We believe the action being proposed
will begin to contribute to improved earnings in the fourth
quarter of our fiscal 1987 and throughout fiscal 1988."
    The company, which is one of the nation's largest
construction firms, also said termination of its defined
benefit retirement plan would produce a pre-tax benefit of
about 10 mln dlrs due to overfunding of the plan.
    In its second quarter ended Dec. 31, CRSS had net earnings
of 800,000 dlrs on revenues of 82.5 mln dlrs.

reduce capacity and employment levels in two polyester fiber
operations of its Eastman Chemicals division.
    A company spokesman said the company will take "some
writeoff" in connection with the action in the first quarter
and there will probably be a further "carryover" writeoff in
the second quarter.  The writeoffs will cover the costs of
plants and equipment involved, as well as expenses connected
with the staff cuts.
    Kodak said the division will discontinue production of
polyester partially-oriented filament yarn, or POY, at its
Carolina Eastman Co plant in Columbia, S.C., and will idle 100
mln pounds of older polyester staple fiber production capacity,
mostly in Columbia.
    The company said about 350 jobs will be affected in
Columbia, most of which are now performed by contract workers,
and about 225 jobs at its Tennessee Eastman Co plant in
Kingsport, Tenn.
    Kodak said part of the staff reduction will be achieved
through an enhanced voluntary separation and retirement plan
for employees of Carolina Eastman, Eastman Chemical Products
Inc and other Kodak units in Kingsport, except Holsten Defense
Corp. Most of the workforce reduction is expected to be
completed by April 30.
    Kodak said depressed prices and poor financial performance
have led to the decision. It said about 50 mln pounds of POY
production will be shut down as a result of its exit from the
business. All Kodak POY production has been at Carolina Eastman
since last year.
    The company said annual capacity for production of Kodel
polyester staple fiber will be reduced to 400 mln pounds from
500 mln due to lesser demand.
    It said it will proceed with a previous decision to phase
in a new 100 mln pound staple fiber plant at Carolina Eastman.
    Carolina Eastman employs about 1,350 and the Kingsport
units affected about 10,800.
    The company spokesman later said the charges will be
insignificant and will have no impact on earnings estimates.

compared with 462 mln dlrs in 1986, said Richard Braddock, head
of Citicorp's individual banking division.
    "We can double our earnings over the next five to seven
years," he told a banking analysts meeting, adding that this
forecast may be on the conservative side.
    He said that bank card operations and the New York branch
system would continue to turn in hefty profits but also picked
out other developing areas, such as U.S. mortgage and
international consumer, as major potential earners.
    Braddock and his sector heads made the following more
specific predictions:
    - Cost of funds and net credit loss levels in the U.S.
bankcard unit will taper off in coming years from 1986's
relatively inflated levels.
    - Customer net revenue in the mortgage banking area will
rise to 464.7 mln dlrs in 1987 from 374.3 mln in 1986.
    - The international consumer business will show 22 pct

    The company said earnings from operations in the second

to be in the break-even range.
    In the second half of 1986 net earnings were 2,297,000

    The company said the charges relate to its
telecommunications products area and three other areas.
    California Microwave previously estimated the write-downs
in the six to eight-mln-dlr range. It said it will add to that
a reserve for investment losses in Argo Communications Corp.
    Also to be included in the write-down are charges against
its advances to an Arizona-based communications electronics
firm the company has an option to acquire, it said.
    In addition, accruals are being made for costs associated
with the company's reduction in its Sunnyvale work force.
    California Microwave said the write-downs should have a
nominal cash impact, as the company already has paid for the

businesses and affiliates will enable Jardine Matheson Holdings
Ltd <JARD.HKG> to report on Friday a big leap in net profit in
1986, stock analysts said.
    They told Reuters they expect the firm to show earnings of
between 420 mln and 450 mln H.K. Dlrs last year against 157 mln
in 1985.
    The analysts also said they expect Jardine Matheson to pay
a total dividend of 15 to 20 cents a share against 10 cents a
share in 1985.
    James Capel (Far East) Ltd estimates Jardine Matheson's
1986 profits at 450 mln dlrs and attributes most of the income
to retail sales.
    Analysts said the group's 7-Eleven retail stores and its
franchises, among them Canon cameras, Christian Dior luxury
goods and Mercedes Benz cars, produced a strong cash flow.
    Alan Hargreaves of Hoare Govett Asia Ltd also put Jardine
Matheson's 1986 net profits at 450 mln dlrs and said he
estimates pre-tax earnings from retail operations at about 465
mln dlrs against 339 mln in 1985.
    But Hargreaves said Jardine Matheson's earnings from its 35
pct stake in Hong Kong Land Co Ltd <HKLD.HKG> will fall to
about 230 mln dlrs from 281 mln dlrs in 1985.
    The reduced contribution reflects the spin-off from Hong
Kong Land of <Dairy Farm International Ltd> last September.
    Jardine gained a direct holding of 35 pct of Dairy Farm as
a result of the spin-off. Analysts said Jardine will book
revenues from its Dairy Farm stake for the final months of the
year as part of its retail business, which will increase its
overall retail income figures.
    Analysts said Jardine Matheson will also enjoy sharply
increased revenues from financial services, mainly its 50 pct
share of <Jardine Fleming Holdings Ltd>.
    Jardine Fleming yesterday reported record profits for 1986
of 209.5 mln dlrs against 104.7 mln in 1985.
    Analysts said Jardine Matheson made net interest payments
of about 200 mln dlrs last year, slightly below the 213 mln
dlrs of 1985, while the company's term debt remained at about
the 1985 level of 2.7 billion dlrs.
    But Jardine was also subject to increased taxes of 340 mln
dlrs last year against 292 mln in 1985, they said.
    Jardine Matheson is undergoing a series of reorganisations
that will in effect turn it into a holding company for its
diverse interests.
    It previously announced a plan to sell its stakes in both
Hong Kong Land and Dairy Farm to newly created <Jardine
Strategic Holdings Ltd> in which it has a 41 pct interest.
    A company statement issued last month said the firm will
use the proceeds to repay all debt, leaving it with an
additional 500 mln dlrs in cash on hand.
    Though Jardine Matheson will be deprived of a direct stake
in the high-yield Hong Kong Land and Dairy Farm units, it is
likely to develop its own business, analysts said.
    "The future of the stock will depend on the firm's ability
to creatively structure some new acquisitions," said Hargreaves
of Hoare Govett.
    He noted the firm has suggested financial services as a key
sector, and he said it may add some insurance firms to its
existing business.

 ]]></BODY><BODY><![CDATA[China's first joint venture bank, Xiamen
International Bank (XIB), reported a group net profit of about
14 mln Hong Kong dlrs in 1986, the bank's first full year of
operation.
    General manager Liu Shuxun declined to give a 1987 profit
forecast, saying targets were under study.
    Assistant general manager Wang Hongshan said the group's
outstanding loans at end-1986 totalled 620 mln Hong Kong dlrs,
up from 530 mln at end-1985. Deposits and interbank borrowings
rose to 680 mln dlrs from 550 mln, he told Reuters.
    Liu said most of the group's profit came from the parent
company rather than its two wholly-owned subsidiaries <Xiamen
International Finance Co Ltd> in Hong Kong and <Luso
International Bank Ltd> in Macao.
    The joint venture bank began operating in September 1985
but did not officially open until March 1986.
    Liu said the share in the joint venture of the foreign
partner, Hong Kong-listed <Panin Holdings Ltd>, had been cut
last year to 49 pct from 60 pct. This was done because foreign
banks felt the XIB's reputation would be improved if the three
Chinese partners collectively held a majority stake, he said.
    Liu said news reports about problems concerning Panin were
unfounded, but he did not elaborate. Panin Holdings reported a
loss of 1.99 mln Hong Kong dlrs in 1986 after a net profit of
268,000 dlrs in 1985.
    The Chinese partners are Industrial and Commercial Bank of
China, Fujian branch, whose share rose to 23.5 pct from 15,
Fujian Investment and Enterprise Corporation 17.5 pct (15) and
Xiamen Construction and Development Corporation 10 pct (10).
    One foreign banker said Xiamen International Bank faced the
same problems as foreign bank branches in trying to compete on
unequal terms with state-owned banks.
    The foreign banking market in Xiamen is thin and almost
saturated, he added.
    Officials of the joint venture bank said they benefitted
from contacts made through its three Chinese partners. But the
foreign banker, who asked not to be named, said it faced
internal competition from the Industrial and Commercial Bank.
    Apart from Xiamen International Bank and the International
Agricultural Development Bank planned by the World Bank and the
state-owned Agricultural Bank of China, Xiamen has eight
foreign bank branches or representative offices, mostly of Hong
Kong or overseas Chinese banks.

plans for a one-for-five bonus issue for both its "A" and "B"
shares following an earlier report of a 44.7 pct jump in 1986
net profits to 1.78 billion H.K. Dlrs.
    The company also announced final dividends of 44 cents per
"A" share and 8.8 cents per "B" share against 32.3 and 6.5 cents a
year ago.
    It recorded extraordinary gains of 1.38 billion dlrs which
mainly derived from the sale in April of a 15.75 pct stake in
Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd <CAPH.HKG> in line with the
floatation of the airline.

said net profit of its U.S. Operating company, BASF Corp, rose
last calendar year to 105 mln dlrs from 39 mln in 1985.
    Turnover rose by by more than one billion dlrs to 3.6
billion, the parent company said in a statement. The rise,
however, partly reflected the inclusion of the first full
business year of three acquisitions made in 1985. Excluding
these, BASF Corp turnover rose four pct from 1985.
    Acquisitions were the high-performance connecting materials
operations of Celanese Corp, Inmont Corp bought from United
Technologies and American Enka bought from AKZO NV <AKZO.AS>.
    BASF said it expected a U.S. Investment of 240 mln dlrs in
1987, part of a five-year programme totalling one billion.
    U.S. Projects completed in 1986 included the second acrylic
acid plant in Freeport, Texas, a technical centre in
Southfield, Michigan, in which paint lines from automotive
plants can be refitted, and the new agricultural research
centre in Research Triangle Park in Durham, North Carolina.
    BASF said that work this year had begun in Geismar,
Louisiana, on plants for production of special amines and
polytetrahydrofuran, as well as for expansion of capacity for
producing tetrahydrofuran.

reduce its dividend to three yen in the year ending March 31
1987 from the five yen of 1985/86, a company spokesman said.
    The company estimated parent company current losses at 15
billion yen in 1986/87, including a gain of 95 billion yen from
the sale of securities. This compares with a 36.07 billion yen
profit a year earlier.
    Sales in 1986/87 are seen at 2,150 billion yen, down from
2,685 billion a year ago.
    Poor business prospects were attributed to the yen's rise
and slow world steel demand. Nippon is expected to report
parent company results in late May.
    Total 1986/87 crude steel production is estimated at 25.57
mln tonnes, down from 27.98 mln a year earlier.
    Crude steel production is likely to be below 1986/87 output
but forecasts for profits and sales in the year starting April

Industries Plc's <BTI.L> major sectors enabled the group's 1986
pretax profits to pass the one billion stg level for the third
year running, Chairman Patrick Sheehy said in a statement.
    The group earlier reported a 19 pct rise in profits to 1.39
billion, which Sheehy said was achieved without any help from
exchange rate fluctuations or acquisitions.
    Good results were achieved by its Argos and Saks Fifth
Avenue in retailing and by Wiggins Teape and Appleton in paper.
    Tobacco accounted for about 50 pct of profit with a four
pct gain to 764 mln stg and a two pct increase in world volume.
    The results were largely in line with analysts expectations
and BAT shares firmed by two pence to 537p at 0955 GMT.
    BAT said the U.S. Brown and Williamson unit held most of
its 1985 gains and increased profit 18 pct in dollar terms.
    Financial services saw profits double to 282 mln with both
Eagle Star and Allied Dunbar achieving further growth.
    Allied Dunbar reported a 51 pct rise in life annual
premiums to 39 mln stg. BAT said it increased new business by
38 pct in the last nine months after a relatively slow first
quarter. Its permanent health insurance was now the market
leader and its Unit Trust group was now the second largest in
the U.K.
    Eagle Star general premiums rose 32 pct to 1.03 billion.
Its life activities also grew 39 pct with better underwriting
results in the second half.
    Cash flow was strong and the gross debt to equity ratio
dropped to 41 pct from 51 pct. The net ratio, at 26 pct, left
the group strongly placed to pursue its further development.
    Profits from paper and pulp grew 29 pct to 217 mln stg,
nearly three times the 1982 level, with Wiggins Teape's sales
rising 36 pct to pass one billion stg.
    BAT said in 1986 it had sold 88 BATUS stores in the U.S.
For 644 mln dlrs and sold Grovewood Securities for 142 mln stg.

international trading group, said its 1986 domestic group net
profit fell by around 20 pct against 1985, adding that the
profit resulted largely from a writing back of reserves.
    The company, which gave no 1986 profit figures, posted a
domestic group net profit of 41 mln marks in 1985.
    It said the 1986 profit was made possible through a 40 mln
mark write-back of reserves that had been created to cover
possible price rises. These reserves were no longer necessary
because of recent declines in raw material prices.
    Kloeckner attributed the profit decline to the fall in
prices as well as the lower value of the dollar.
    It said it would pay an unchanged dividend on its ordinary
share capital, which is entirely in private hands and held
largely by family foundations.
    Kloeckner's nominal 100 mark profit-participation
certificates, issued in October 1986, will pay a likely yield
of around 10 pct. Holders of the certificates are entitled to a
quarter of the 1986 payment, or around 2.50 marks, the company
added.

continued growth in all divisions this year though it sees
problems in the marine sector, chairman Michael Miles said.
    He told reporters:"1987 has started well for Cathay Pacific
Airways which looks forward to another good year... Swire
Properties expects further good results both from properties
under development for sale and from its investment property
portfolio."
    He did not give any specific projections for earnings. The
company earlier reported 46 pct higher 1986 net profits at 1.78
billion H.K. Dlrs from a year ago.
    Swire also had an extraordinary profit of 1.38 billion dlrs
mainly from the sale of a 15.25 pct interest in Cathay Pacific
Airways Ltd <CAPH.HKG>.
    Miles said the company will use the money to develop its
business, primarily in Hong Kong.
    Swire's stake in Cathay was first reduced to 54.25 pct from
70 pct when Cathay was publicly floated, and then cut to 50.25
pct when Cathay issued new shares amounting to 12 pct of the
enlarged capital to the state-owned <China International Trust
and Investment Corp>. Cathay last week reported its 1986
profits rose to 1.23 billion dlrs from 777 mln a year ago.
    Miles said despite last year's rapid expansion in Cathay's
flights and fleet, load factor is still holding up at 70 pct.
    He said Cathay's growth last year was the result of "a
marginal increase in the revenue load factor coupled with
savings in fuel costs."
    "At present fuel prices are stable and will remain stable
for the rest of this year," he said, "though there might be a bit
of increase later this year.''
    Miles said Swire is not abandoning its offshore oil service
operations, even though the marine sector is generally
depressed. "Obviously the marine industry is not getting any
better," he said.
    The real estate market remained strong and Swire last year
revalued its property portfolio up 634 mln dlrs compared with
an increase of 864.4 mln dlrs the previous year.
    Miles said he expects the property market to remain firm
but said the firm has no available land for a major housing
project such as its Taikoo Shing development on Hong Kong
island now near completion.
    He said the company's 50 pct unit <Hongkong United Dockyard
Ltd> is negotiating with the government for the development of
an existing petroleum storage depot into a major housing
estate. "But it's not as big as Taikoo Shing," he said.

said it expects to report 1987 first quarter earnings of about
12 mln dlrs or about 1.12 dlrs a share and revenues of about
190 mln dlrs.
    In the comparable quarter a year ago, Utilicorp earned 8.5
mln dlrs or 87 cts on revenues of 203 mln dlrs.
    There are 9.6 mln shares outstanding this year, up from the
8.5 mln shares in 1986, Utilicorp's president Richard Green
told financial analysts here.
    First quarter 1987 results include one month contribution
of West Virginia Power, which became a division on March 1,
1987, Green said in remarks prepared for delivery to analysts.
    Higher earnings for the period reflected reduced operating
and maintenenace expenses and about 10 mln dlrs in rate
increases in Iowa, Minnesota, Kansas and Colorado, he said.
    However, Utilicorp's Missouri Public Service division is
experiencing the effect of a 5.9 pct rate reduction authorized
in September 1986, he noted.
    Of Utilicorp's total revenues expected for the 1987 first
quarter, about 43 mln dlrs will be derived from electric
operations and about 147 mln dlrs will come from gas
operations, he said.
    Operating income derived from electric operations in the
first three months of 1987 is estimated to be eight mln dlrs,
while the contribution from gas operations will be about 10 mln
dlrs, Green said.
    Green told analysts that Utilicorp received regulatory
approval from various states and the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission to reincorporate in Delaware, effective April one.
    Utilicorp signed an agreement with Cominco Ltd of Vancouver
to extend the deadline to May 31, 1987, for completion of the
company's purchase of West Kootenay Power and Light of British
Columbia, due to a longer than expected regulatory approval
process, he said.
    Hearings were completed in February and a decision by the
British Columbia Utilities Commission on the 60 mln dlrs

Donald Lennox repeated that benefits from recapitalization are
likely to boost future earnings for fiscal 1987.
    Lennox told the annual meeting that future quarterly and
full year earnings from ongoing operations should be
"significantly above 1986 results."
    In his remarks, Lennox said management has no plans to
recommend reinstatement of the company's common stock dividend
in the foreseeable future.
    He said the outlook for the medium duty truck market
continues to point to little or no change. But recent order
receipts indicate a "firmer tone in the heavy duty truck
segment," which could result in a five to eight pct increase in
industry shipments for the full year, he said.
    After restructuring under the holding company format, the
company's present truck and engine subsidiary will be known as
Navistar International Transportation Corp. Neil Springer
currently president and chief operating officer of Navistar
International was named chairman of the new subsidiary.
    James Cotting, now vice chairman and chief financial
officer, was named to succeed Lennox as chairman and chief
executive officer of Navistar International Corp. Lennox will
retire March 31.

which were at the upper end of market expectations, showed the
company was in a strong position and that its shares were
probably undervalued, share analysts said.
    BAT shares were down at 524p in late afternoon trading
after a previous 535p close. They touched a high of 538p
earlier on news of a 19 pct rise in annual profits to 1.39
billion pre-tax.
    Stock market analysts said today's generally weak stock
market plus unwinding of positions after heavy buying of BAT
shares in the run-up to the results caused the fall in the
share price.
    "In the current market, people almost expect companies to
beat expectations," said one analyst, adding that pretax profits
of 1.35 to 1.40 billion stg had been forecast.
    BAT's 1986 figure of 1.39 billion stg compared with a 1985
pretax profit of 1.17 billion.
    Brokers noted that BAT's shift away from its
underperforming industries and the decreasing share of the
tobacco portion of the group were seen as good signs.
    BAT Chairman Patrick Sheehy told a news conference that the
tobacco sector of the company had declined to 50 pct from 74
pct four years ago.
    Sheehy said he could see the tobacco portion of the company
declining further as other sectors increased in importance.
    He said BAT was looking to expand in the area of financial
services, in particular in the U.S.
    Sheehy also said the group had "no sizeable acquisitions" in
sight in the near future.
    Analysts said BAT's increasingly good performance in the
U.K. Insurance area was encouraging.
    Its declining debt-to-equity ratio of currently about 16
pct also made it likely that BAT would soon be looking to make
major acquisitions, they said.

dividend policy, chairman Edwin Lupberger said.
    He told securities analysts that when the company's common
dividend is resumed, "the initial rate will appear conservative
to you by industry standards and in relation MSU's net income
and cash flow."
    "Our progress will determine how soon we can reinstate a
dividend to our common stockholders, he said."
    The company last paid a common dividend of 44.5 cts a share
in July 1985.
    Lupberger told the analysts that the company's primary
objective is "to create financial strength, enough strength so
that what happened to us and our stockholders over the past
couple of years never happens again."
    The company has faced regulatory challenges to rates
proposed to cover the cost of its Grand Gulf nuclear plant.
    He said Middle South's net income is expected to post
"modest growth" over the next three years.
    In 1986, the company earned 451.3 mln dlrs or 2.21 dlrs a
share on revenues of 3.49 billion dlrs.
    Lupberger said, "A good portion of the improvement
projected for the next three years comes from keeping the lid

it expects first quarter earnings to be 20 to 25 pct below the

    Combustion said the restructuring at Lummus Crest is
expected to substantially reduce but not eliminate this year
losses in the Engineering and Construction segment.
    But it said improvement at Lummus Crest is expected to be
approximately offset by a number of factors, including a
somewhat lower level of earnings in the Power Generation
segment than in 1986, financing costs of the AccuRay
acquisition, costs associated with integrating AccuRay
technology and operations and delays in waste to energy
projects.

fourth quarter and a new peak in sales and earnings for the
fiscal year ending April 30, president Peter Widdrington told
financial analysts.
    He would not make any specific forecast, but said he was
optimistic for further growth in fiscal 1988 in the company's
brewing and food products operations.
    Labatt's earnings rose to 92.8 mln dlrs in the nine months
ended January 31 from year-earlier 78 mln dlrs. Revenue for the
nine months rose to 3.20 billion dlrs from 2.70 billion dlrs.
    Widdrington said Labatt's three-year business plan, now
being updated, targets total sales of about six billion dlrs,
including 2.50 billion dlrs in the U.S.
    Labatt, Canada's leading brewer, has expanded in the U.S.
food products industry by acquisitions.
    Widdrington said Labatt's strategy for U.S. expansion
stemmed partly from its strong market position in the Canadian
food and beverage industry. The U.S. share of revenues for this
year will be about 35 pct, rising to 40 pct in fiscal 1988, he
said.

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission decision today on natural
gas cost recovery could reduce its 1987 earnings by about 1.25
dlrs a share.
    The company said "this could bring earnings for 1987 below
Columbia's stated goal of earning no less than its 3.18 dlrs
per share dividend." It earned 2.12 dlrs a share in 1986.
    It said management expects to recommend to the board that
the dividend rate be maintained in 1987.
    Columbia Gas said the impact of the FERC decision may be
offset by a one-time accounting change rleated to future tax
liabilities under the new federal tax laws.
    The company recorded these liabilities based on older,
higher tax rates, but an action being considered by the
Financial Accounting Standards Board could result in a gain of
about 1.20 dlrs a share in 1987, it explained.
    "Thus there is a good chance that we will attain our 1987
earnings goal -- although not in the way originally planned,"
Columbia Gas said.
    Columbia Gas said the FERC decision would limit the
recovery of certain gas contract costs by Columbia Gas
Transmission Corp, the company's principal pipeline subsidiary.
    It said the decision specifically excluded from a purchased
gas adjustment filing by the pipeline costs related to
amortizing payments made to producers to reform gas purchase
contracts. These were excluded on the grounds the subsidiary
failed to sufficiently support cost recovery.
    The company said its subsidiary is not precluded from
making a new filing to provide sufficient support.

to rise to 1.20-1.40 dlrs a share from 91 cts a share last
year, with revenues climbing to about 430 mln dlrs from last
year's 350 mln dlrs, president Alex Taylor said before the
annual meeting.
    SNC, Canada's second biggest engineering and construction
group, became the country's largest ammunition manufacturer
last year with its 90 mln dlr acquisition of Canadian Arsenals
Ltd from the Canadian government.
    The impact of that and several smaller deals will be felt
fully in 1987, Taylor said.
    Defense preoducts and other manufacturing operations will
account for more than half SNC's total 1987 revenues, helping
to counterbalance the more cyclical engineering and
construction acivities, Taylor said.
    Last year, SNC earned 8.7 mln dlrs, including a small
extraordinary gain.
    In 1987, a total manufacturing activities will generate
about 235 mln dlrs in revenues, and engineering and
construction about 200 mln dlrs, he said, adding that defense
products operations should be a major contributor to earnings.

its planned acquisitions of cellular telephone and paging
systems, including those of <Metromedia Inc>, will result in
some initial earnings dilution and an increase in debt ratio.
    In a letter to shareholders in its 1986 annual report, the
regional Bell company did not indicate the degree of earnings
dilution it expects from the acquisitions, which total some
1.38 billion dlrs. However, the company said the rise in its
debt ratio will be temporary and will leave its debt level
within an acceptable range.
    In its 1986 yearend financial statement, Southwestern Bell
listed a debt-to-equity ratio of 43.4 pct, down slightly from
43.7 pct in 1985.
    In 1986, the company earned 1.02 billion dlrs, or 10.26
dlrs a share, compared with 996.2 mln dlrs, or 10 dlrs a share
in 1985. Revenues dipped to 7.90 billion dlrs from 7.93 billion
dlrs.
    Southwestern Bell said it expects the new tax law to have a
negative impact on its cash flow, due mainly to the loss of
investment tax credits.
    By mid-year, however, the company said a reduced corporate
tax rate should have a positive impact on its net income and
cash flow.
    In addition, the company said it is projecting a 1.7 pct
gain in customer telephone lines and a three to four pct
increase in long distance calling volumes.
    Southwestern Bell said 1987 capital expenditures will be
lower that the 1.97 billion dlrs spent in 1986, a year in which
expenditures were held below budget.

year loss against a prior year profit, said improvement is
expected in the balance of fiscal 1987 as new products fill the
inventory pipeline, cutbacks in operating costs are realized
and its newly acquired Dayton Walther business is fully
integrated.
    However, operating results are likely to remain under
pressure in the first quarter ending April 30, it said.
    Varity earlier reported a loss for fiscal 1986 ended
January 31 of 23.3 mln U.S. dlrs, compared to a year-earlier
profit of 3.9 mln dlrs.
    Varity said continued deterioration in major markets, a
weakening U.S. dollar and unforeseen delays in launching major
new lines of tractors contributed to the full year loss.
    Industry demand for farm machinery continued to erode
during the latest fiscal year, with worldwide industry retail
sales of tractors sliding more than 10 pct below last year's
depressed levels, the company said.
    However, Varity increased its share of the global tractor
market by more than one pct to 18.2 pct, it said.
    The combined impact of costly sales incentives and foreign
exchange adjustments on margins was substantial, Varity said.

AG's <LING.F> world group turnover rose to 518.6 mln marks in
the first two months of 1987, 5.2 pct more than in the same
1986 period, management board chairman Hans Meinhardt said.
    But world group incoming orders fell 2.2 pct to 587.3 mln
marks, Meinhardt told the annual news conference. Excluding
exchange rate movements, world group turnover rose 8.9 pct and
incoming orders increased 1.0 pct.
    Linde expects satisfactory results and increased sales this
year but Meinhardt gave no detailed forecast. Domestic group
1986 net profit rose to 105.79 mln marks from 80.71 mln.
    Meinhardt said domestic group turnover rose 6.7 pct to
394.1 mln marks in the first two 1987 months against the same
period last year but incoming orders fell 5.2 pct to 456.6 mln.
    Linde will ask shareholders at the annual meeting on May 13
to raise authorised share capital by a maximum 30 mln marks
nominal for the issue of share warrant bonds with a maximum
issue volume of 200 mln marks. Linde's authorised share capital
currently stands at a nominal 49.6 mln marks.
    Meinhardt said the authorisation would give the company the
necessary flexibility in case Linde needed additional funds for
acquisitions. He declined to give further details.
    While world group turnover rose 7.2 pct to 3.88 billion
marks in 1986, incoming orders were barely changed at 3.91
billion marks. Meinhardt said without the sharp appreciation of
the mark against major trading partner currencies, incoming
orders would have been four pct above the prior year's level.
    World group turnover in heavy plant construction rose 7.4
pct to 777 mln marks, but incoming orders dropped 5.7 pct to
739 mln marks in the wake of the dollar and oil price plunge.
    World sales for technical gases rose 5.1 pct to 1.05
billion marks and incoming orders gained 5.2 pct to 1.05
billion marks.
    Meinhardt said Linde strengthened its market position in
the refrigeration sector, with particularly strong turnover and
order gains in Austria, Italy and Norway. World group sales in
the sector fell 2.5 pct to 493 mln marks, but incoming orders
rose 2.5 pct to 513 mln marks.
    The fork lift truck and hydraulic sector saw world group
sales rising 12.4 pct to 1.52 billion marks and incoming orders
gaining 8.0 pct to 1.57 billion marks.
    Domestic group turnover rose 8.2 pct to 2.93 billion marks
and incoming orders increased 1.9 pct to 2.92 billion marks.
The company was producing at full capacity in 1986.

statement it increased its pretax profits in 1986 despite a
fall in turnover due to lower foreign sales.
    The lower sales were due to the fall in the dollar and
other currencies against the mark. Other factors were pressure
on selling prices because of a sharp fall in the prices of
crude oil and petrochemical raw materials and the sale of
polystyrene business in the U.S. And Netherlands.
    World group pretax profit rose to 3.21 billion marks in
1986 from 3.16 billion in 1985, with sales falling to 38.01
billion from 42.72 billion.
    Within group turnover, foreign sales fell to 27.18 billion
marks in 1986 from 31.92 billion in 1985, a drop of 14.9 pct.
    The statement made no mention of net profit figures.
Hoechst will announce its dividend proposal on April 23.
    In the first quarter of this year sales were hit by the
cold weather at the start of the year. If the dollar continues
at present low levels, 1987 sales will again be below the
previous year, although in volume terms they are unchanged from
1986, Hoechst said.
    Sales of paints and dyes, fibres, sheeting and information
technology all rose in 1986 but plant construction sales fell.
    Hoechst attributed its good results to the performance of
the parent company, other units in West Germany, and to
<American Hoechst Corp>.
    Improved earnings in the U.S. Largely reflected the
restructuring of styrene and polystyrene activities.
    Roussel Uclaf <RUCF.PA> and most domestic non-consolidated
partners did not perform as well as in 1985.
    Hoechst attributed the 12 pct rise in parent company pretax
profits to 1.82 billion marks above all to a rise in earnings
from interest and holdings in other companies, and a fall in
extraordinary costs.
    The fall in raw material prices was not enough to
compensate for the decline in turnover due to lower prices and
currencies, Hoechst said.
    The bulk of the 2.53 billion marks investment in new
projects, up from 294 mln marks in 1985, went on the capital
increase of Hoechst Capital Corp in connection with the
acquisition of <Celanese Corp>.
    Celanese was merged with American Hoechst in February to
form <Hoechst Celanese Corp>.

Hill Pty Co Ltd <BRKN.S> (BHP), is expected to report a net
profit of around 600 mln to 620 mln dlrs tomorrow for the first
nine months ended February 28, share analysts polled by Reuters
said.
    This would be well below the 813.0 mln dlrs earned in the
first three quarters of 1985/86. In the full year ended May 31
1986 the group earned a record 988.2 mln dlrs.
    The analysts estimated that the group would report a third
quarter net in the region of 200 mln to 220 mln dlrs, against
238.6 mln a year earlier and 220.3 mln in the second quarter.
    BHP's earnings in the first half ended November 30 amounted
to 397.0 mln dlrs, sharply down from 589.3 mln a year earlier.
    The analysts predicted that BHP will report an upturn in
petroleum earnings compared with the first quarter, reflecting
some improvement in crude oil prices from the Bass Strait
fields, but these gains would be offset by lower mineral and
steel earnings.
    They said the mineral group has been hit by lower coal
prices and shipments to Japan while the steel division has been
affected by industrial and production problems.
    The analysts noted that the third quarter is normally BHP's
lowest-earning period owing to a number of seasonal factors,
and they predicted a sharp rise in fourth quarter net to around
300 mln dlrs.
    One key factor in the fourth quarter is expected to be a
tax break of some 70 mln dlrs for the investment allowance on
capital expenditure in the steel division, they said.
    They said they saw BHP's full year earnings at around 900
mln to 920 mln dlrs. They added that such a decline from
1985/86 would be no surprise, noting BHP has said that it would
be difficult to equal its record 1985/86 net profit.

<SIEG.F> should rise to 51 or 52 billion marks in the current
year to September 31 after a 19 pct upturn in the first five
months, management board chairman Karlheinz Kaske said.
    Siemens reported world group turnover in 1985/86 of 47.02
billion marks.
    Kaske told the annual shareholders meeting turnover rose to
21.2 billion marks in the first five months of 1986/87, about
19 pct above the same year-ago period. The rise was mainly due
to payment in January for a West German nuclear power station
which led to a jump in domestic sales of 36 pct.
    In the first five 1986/87 months, turnover abroad showed a
three pct increase, Kaske said, without giving figures.
    In the same period incoming orders rose five pct to 21.8
billion marks against the same 1985/86 period.
    For the year as a whole incoming orders should rise between
one and two billion marks to around 51 or 52 billion.
    Apart from payments for the nuclear power station, the
communications and telecommunications sectors in particular
should contribute to growth this year, Kaske said.
    But it was not possible to make a profit forecast for
1986/87 because of uncertainty about the direction of the
dollar, Kaske said.
    Siemens already reported that first quarter 1986/87 group
net profit fell marginally to 296 mln marks from 298 mln in the
same period in the previous year.
    Turnover in the first five months rose particularly
strongly in the installations and automotive technology,
communications and telecommunications sectors, but components
and energy and automation showed a sharp decline.
    Kaske said domestic orders rose to 10.2 billion marks in
the first five months of this year, or nine pct above their
level in the same 1985/86 period, boosted in particular by
orders for the fully owned Kraftwerk Union AG subsidiary.
    Foreign orders grew one pct to 11.6 billion marks. An
increase in orders through newly acquired subsidiaries abroad
was balanced by the decline in the dollar.
    While the installations and automotive technology sector
showed a sharp rise in orders, energy and automation and
communications orders were below the level achieved in the same
period of 1985/86.
    Telecommunications orders remained at roughly the same
level.
    Kaske said investments were expected to remain around six
billion marks in 1986/87 after a 50 pct increase the previous
year. Research and development were likely to rise 13 pct to
6.1 billion marks or around 12 pct of turnover.

<KRPG.D> steel and engineering group said it had a satisfactory
1986 despite a provisional 12 pct fall in total group sales to
18.1 billion marks from 20.7 billion the previous year.
    Third party turnover declined to 15.9 billion from 18.5
billion in 1985 while orders slipped to 15.5 billion marks from
16.9 billion, it said in a preliminary statement.
    Despite these figures, which reflected the dollar's
weakness against the mark and oil and raw materials price
falls, it said 1986 was a satisfactory year.
    The reason was the continued expansion of the machinery and
plant sector, which accounted for 42 pct of total sales.
    Krupp added that some areas of the mechanical engineering
business achieved notable growth rates and acquisitions had
underpinned machinery and component activities.
    An orders decline in the steel and, in particular, the
trading and services sectors, affected the group's total order
figures.
    However, "all business sectors contributed to the positive
results achieved in 1986," Krupp added, without giving details.
    Domestic orders decreased by five pct to 9.6 billion marks
from the previous year and foreign orders fell 14 pct to 5.9
billion, it said. Foreign business accounted for 38 pct of
orders against 40 pct in 1985.
    Orders received by the machinery and plant sector, 11
member companies which comprise the core area of the group,
rose by four mln marks last year to 6.9 billion, Krupp said.
    The group's orders in hand amounted to 9.1 billion marks at
end-December 1986 from 10.3 billion at the start of the year.
    Orders received by the steel sector last year decreased by
three pct to 6.2 billion marks from 1985, it said.
    The steel market weakened increasingly over the year,
mainly because of exchange rate movements, the deterioration in
foreign trade and a downturn in a number of customer
industries.
    The difficult market for sections and flats of quality
steel depressed order tonnages by around seven pct, Krupp said.
But special steel boosted by strong demand for stainless
cold-rolled flats, grew by five pct in tonnage terms.

Commercial vehicle and tractor markets as well as in North

    The company earlier reported a two mln stg rise in pretax

    It said it would continue with plans for all its activities

    Costs of restructuring, reorganisation, employee training

together with high research and development spending would
affect profits in the short term.
    But Lucas said it was exploiting growth opportunities in
automotive markets, especially in vehicle breaking and engine

Joseph Pinola said the bank holding company would lose about 16
mln dlrs per year, after taxes, if it had to put its medium and
long-term debt on non-accrual status.
    In an interview, he said that could result in about a 4.5
pct decline in annual earnings per share.
    Pinola said First Interstate, like other banks, has not yet
decided to put the loans, which Brazil stopped paying interest
on last month, on non-accrual status.
    "None of us really wants to injure negotiations that might
be going on," he said.
    First Interstate reported to the Securities and Exchange
Commission last week that it has about 339 mln dlrs in
medium-to long-term loans to Brazil.
    It said on December 31, 1986 its nonperformind Brazilian
outstanding debt totaled about 4.1 mln dlrs.
    First Interstate also has about 168 mln dlrs in short-term
loans or trade lines to Brazil.
    Pinola said he believes the solution to the Brazilian debt
crisis will be more political than economic, which he said he
finds, "very disquieting and discomforting."

said it anticipates profit for fiscal 1987 ending June 30 will
be lower than fiscal 1986 earnings of 410,000 dlrs, despite an
expected revenue increase of 37 pct to more than 3.5 mln dlrs.
    After an extraordinary expense associated with the
December, 1986 withdrawal of a planned common share offering,
"we expect to be modestly profitable for the year, but below the
410,000 dlrs earned in fiscal 1986," the company said.
    Carolian previously reported fiscal six month profit of
12,933 dlrs, excluding an extraordinary loss of 17,210 dlrs,
compared to earnings of 69,829 dlrs in the prior year.
    The company said it anticipated fiscal 1987 earnings to be
lower due to withdrawal of its share offering, computer
equipment shipment delays and costs associated with sales staff
expansion.
    A strengthening Canadian dollar against U.S. currency will
also adversely affect revenues and earnings, since 85 pct of
revenues are generated by sales outside Canada, said Carolian,

Group Inc, told Reuters the company's first quarter results
will be up sharply over last year's eight cents a share.
    "First quarter results will be dramatically better," he
said following a presentation to analysts. He cited a sharp
drop in non-earning assets, healthy asset growth and lower
expenses.
    He declined to predict specific results for the first
quarter. In the 1986 first quarter, the commerical finance
company earned 606,000 dlrs, or eight cts per share.
    Gevirtz also declined to predict full year results, but
said, "We expect an excellent year." In 1986 Foothill earned
3,239,000 dlrs, or 41 cts per share.
    Analysts expect Foothill to record earnings of 65 cts to 85
cts a share in 1987.
    During the presentation Gevirtz said Foothill has reduced
to less than five pct the company's level of non-performing
assets, which was as high as eight pct in previous years.
    David Hilton, chief financial officer, said the company's
general and administrative expenses in 1987 will be reduced to
about 3.0 to 3.5 pct of average assets from 4.3 pct in 1986.

first quarter net income is now expected to exceed the 3.1 mln

    Previously, the company had said first quarter results
would likely be lower than for the 1986 period due to
production disruptions caused by the large number of production
line changes scheduled during the first quarter, its statement
pointed out.
    While the disruptive effects of the production line changes
had occurred in line with expectations, Anchor Glass said,
first quarter operating results were helped by lower than
anticipated operating costs and improved margins on sales as a
result of a more favorable product mix.
    The company said its income performance for the full year
remains very good.
    It also said Anchor Hocking Corp <ARH> has converted the
entire principal balance of its Anchor Glass convertible
subordinated note to 576,694 Anchor Glass common shares.
    Anchor Glass said the conversion decreased its total debt

up from 79 cts a share last year, Chairman William Brown said.
    He told shareholders the company has a 190 mln dlr exposure
in loans to Brazil if that country defaults on its debt
payments. If a default does occur, it would first quarter
earnings by about five cts a share, which would bring the
bank's in the lower level of the estimated range, he added.
    Brown noted the 1986 first quarter net included a 17 cts
gain from loan restructurings which will not appear this year.
    Brown said the bank's other nonperforming assets, not
including its Brazilian exposure, could rise to over 700 mln
dlrs at the end of this quarter compared with 669 mln dlrs a
year earlier and 614 mln dlrs at the end of 1986.
    He said the increase includes all of its Equadorian loans
which he expects will be ultimately repaid after the company
recovers from an earthquake earlier this year.
    Brown said the increase also includes some Mexican and
Venezuelan loans as those nations are also facing credit
problems.
    Brown said the Bank of Boston remains "cautiously optimitic
about the full year even if our Brazilian exposure were to be
on nonaccural all year." In 1986, the bank earned 3.69 dlrs a

lower taxes and royalties, reduced financing costs and from
operating efficiencies and downsizing put into place during

    The company, which went public in March 1985, earlier
reported losses for the fourth quarter.
    It said the auditor's statement, known as a "subject to"

and negative cash flow, it must achieve profitable operations
or acquire additional equity capital or other financing to
continue in existence.
    HealthMate reported a loss for the year of 1,512,534 dlrs,

had a loss of 1,553,592 dlrs, or 20 cts a share on revenues of

preliminary findings by regulatory examiners of its AMBANK
subsidiary will result in a first quarter charge of 14.1 mln
dlrs and a writedown of 1.4 mln dlrs.
    The charge will be made against the allowance for possible
loan losses, and the writedown is of other real estate.
    Great American said the examiners were conducting a regular
examination and a final report is not expected for several
weeks. Management intends to include the charge and writedown
in response to the preliminary findings.
    Great American said regulatory authorities are not
requiring an adjustment of the previously reported financial
results for Great American for 1986.
    However, Great American has revised its previous estimates
of provisions for possible losses and has added 9.9 mln dlrs to
the allowance account as of December 31, 1986. It said it took
the action since the charge-offs will significantly deplete its
allowance for possible loan losses and the economic environment
does not show signs for significant improvement in the near
future.
    It said the additional provision increases the allowance to
26.4 mln dlrs, representing 6.63 pct of the outstanding loan
portfolio and 83.2 pct of non-performing loans at year-end.
    Great American said its revised net loss for the fourth
quarter is 14.1 mln dlrs, or 6.36 dlrs per share, compared to a
net loss of 2.4 mln dlrs or 1.06 dlrs per share the year

against a 73.38 mln dlr profit in 1985 after sales fell to 2.27
billion dlrs from 2.94 billion.
    The British Petroleum Co Plc <BP.L> unit attributed the
deficit to stock losses arising from the drop in crude prices
in the first half, when it made a 119.93 mln dlr loss.
    It said government compensation, in the form of subsidies
to refiners to partially cover stock losses, together with
improved crude prices in the second half, enabled the group's
oil business to make a modest pre-tax profit.
    BP Australia said it had not recommended a dividend.
    Commenting on the year's performance, the company said it
suspended operations at the 60 pct-owned Agnew Nickel mine
because of losses sustained from declining nickel prices.
    The results also included an 11.3 mln dlr extraordinary
writedown on the value of the laid-up oil exploration drillship
Regional Endeavour.
    BP Australia said it had sold its 33-1/3 stake in chemical

<JARD.HKG> said it planned a bonus issue of four new "B" shares
of 20 H.K. Cents each for every ordinary share of par value two
dlrs.
    A company statement said the firm expects to pay a total
1987 dividend of four cents per "B" share, while the "A" share
dividend will be maintained at last year's level of 40 cents a
share.
    Jardine Matheson announced earlier a 205 pct jump in 1986
net profits to 479 mln dlrs from 157 mln in 1985.
    Shareholders' funds increased to 5.02 billion dlrs from
4.77 billion in 1985, the statement said.
    It quoted chairman Simon Keswick as saying Jardine Matheson
achieved the good performance through satisfactory results in
most sections, especially Hong Kong Land Co Ltd <HKLD.HKG>,
Jardine Fleming Co Ltd, and its business in Japan.
    He said the group's stake of about 35 pct in Hong Kong
Land, which will be lowered to 26 pct after the completion of a
reorganisation, is "a long term investment and now stands at a
level which causes us no financial strain or problems of asset
imbalance."
    Keswick said the issue of new "B" shares will give the group
"the flexibility in the future to issue ordinary shares for
expansion without jeopardising the shareholding stability which
has been brought about through the group's recent
restructuring."
    He said the new issue is pending approval from both the
firm's shareholders and warrant holders, adding an appropriate
adjustment will be made to the warrant exercise price.
    The Jardine group has nearly completed its reorganisation,
with Jardine Matheson transferring its control of Hk Land to
the new unit <Jardine Strategic Holdings Ltd>.
    Jardine Strategic will also hold majority stakes in the two
companies spun off from Hk Land -- <Mandarin Oriental
International Ltd> and <Dairy Farm International Holdings Ltd>
-- plus cross holdings with Jardine Matheson.
    Jardine Matheson, which had debts of about 2.7 billion dlrs
last year, will become debt free after the restructuring.
    "A positive cash flow from operations and disposals,
continuing into 1987, has transformed our balance sheet,"
Keswick said. He noted the firm last year sold interests in
airfreight operations, Australian properties and trucking
business, and its remaining U.S. Oil and gas activities.
    Jardine Matheson decided to make a provision against its
general trading business in the Middle East in view of the
continuing weakness of oil prices, Keswick said. But he said
the operations would be profitable in the longer term.
    He said the firm's function "has evolved into one primarily
of strategy, structure and financial and personnel policy."
    He said Jardine Matheson will reduce the size of the board
of directors but will simultaneously create a new Pacific
regional board. He gave no further details of the change.
    Jardine Matheson shares rose 20 cents to 24.90 dlrs at
midday on the Hong Kong stock market. In early trading it had
fallen to 24.30 dlrs because of rumours yesterday that the firm
planned a rights issue.

said it expects a strong full year result, helped by sigificant
investment allowance credits in the fourth quarter, but net
will fall short of the record 988.2 mln dlrs earned in 1985/86
ended May 31.
    The group earlier reported its net earnings dropped to
603.0 mln dlrs in the first three quarters ended February 28
from 813.0 mln a year earlier.
    Third quarter net fell to 206.0 mln dlrs from 238.6 mln a
year earlier and 220.3 mln in the second quarter ended November
31, BHP said in a statement.
    Earnings in the first nine months were at the lower end of
share analysts' forecasts yesterday of a range of 600 mln to
620 mln dlrs.
    BHP held its annual dividend unchanged at 37.5 cents after
declaring a steady final dividend of 20 cents and announced a
one-for-five bonus issue to shareholders registered May 1.
    The bonus is being made from reserves which will not
qualify for tax-free distribution after the introduction of
dividend imputation next July 1.
    The bonus shares will not rank for the final dividend, BHP
said.
    BHP said it should not be expected that the present rate of
dividend will be maintained on the increased capital.
    The level of future dividends will be influenced by the
implications of the proposed dividend imputation legislation,
it said.
    As previously reported, dividends will become tax-free in
shareholders' hands provided they are paid out of profits that
have borne the full 49 pct company tax rate.
    BHP, which confined comment to the third quarter, said
petroleum net earnings dropped to 98.8 mln dlrs from 139.6 mln
a year earlier, and steel profit to 27.0 mln from 48.8 mln.
    BHP said the petroleum division earnings fall reflected
generally lower oil prices and sales volumes from Bass Strait
while the steel decline was due to a five pct fall in domestic
sales and higher costs associated with the commissioning of new
plant and some operational difficulties.
    The rise in third quarter minerals net to 95.7 mln dlrs
from 81.5 mln a year earlier largely reflected the increase in
ownership of the Mt Newman iron ore project, it said.
    The 60.7 mln dlr extraordinary gain, all in the third term,
reflected a 240.7 mln profit on the sale of <Blue Circle
Southern Cement Ltd> offset by a U.S. Oil acreage writedown.

from 942.89 mln.
    MMAL, 99 pct-owned by Mitsubishi Motors Corp <MIMT.T> and

failed to recover 19 mln dlrs in costs sustained because of a
weak Australian dollar.

    Imported passenger car, light commercial and heavy vehicle
sales suffered while local-manufacturing profitability was

Porsche AG <PSHG.F> said it expects to post a satisfactory
profit in 1986/87, with domestic volume sales seen lower but
U.S. Sales anticipated higher.
    Managing board chairman Peter Schutz said domestic sales
were expected to fall to 9,000 in the year ending July 31 from
11,340 in 1985/86. U.S. Sales should rise to more than 30,000
from 28,670 last year.
    Schutz made no specific profit or sales forecasts. Last
month the company said it expected net profit to fall below 70
mln marks this year from 75.3 mln marks in 1985/86.
    For sales, Porsche expects its overall world volume this
year to be above 50,000. Sales last year stood at 53,254,
Schutz said. His expectations of a satisfactory profit were
based on a combination of price rises and cost-cutting, he
added.
    The expected drop in West German sales this year would be
the result of the so-called "grey market" for Porsche cars, he
said. When the dollar was strong against the mark, many
Porsches had been bought locally in West Germany for illegal
export to the U.S.
    Porsche has previously said domestic sales in the 1986/87
first half fell to 3,267 from 5,387 in the same 1985/86 period.
    The fact that U.S. Sales will account for a larger
percentage of overall sales this year than before does not pose
problems for profit, the Porsche board said.
    In the last 12 months it has raised U.S. Prices by around
20 pct without suffering any decline in sales. At the same time
Porsche has hedged its dollar-denominated business for the
1986/87 business year, finance director Heinz Branitzki.
    Branitzki put Porsche's hedging costs in 1985/86 at 28 mln
marks.
    In a speech to the annual meeting, Schutz said third-party
orders placed with Porsche's engineering research centre in
Weissach were rising and should top 100 mln marks this year for
the first time.
    Porsche's net profit dropped sharply to 75.3 mln marks in
1985/86 from 120.4 mln marks in 1984/85.

earnings per share growth will exceed sales growth and will be
in the double digit range through 1989.
    In 1986, the company earned 4.42 dlrs a share on revenues
of 10.7 billion dlrs.
    Speaking at a meeting for securities analysts, Douglas
Danforth, Westinghouse's chairman, said the company's sales
growth target is about 8.5 pct a year for 1988 and 1989, "given
an economic environment that remains on a moderate growth
course." He also said the company will make acquisitions, but
he did not specify particular targets.
    Paul E. Lego, senior executive vice president told the
analysts "our plans do not call for a multibillion dlr
acquisition, even though our balance sheet can handle one.
Despite this disclaimer, if we identify a major acquisition
that has significnt value-creating for Westinghouse...we will
consider it." He said the company would consider an acquisition
candidate that is in an area compatable with Westinghouse's
primiary businesses.
    Danforth said the corportation was focused in several key
areas including defense electronics, financial services,
broadcasting, electrical products and services for construction
and industrial and utility markets.
    Danforth added that he expects Westinghouse's sales to grow
faster than the markets the corportation serves and "surely
faster than GNP."
    He said earnings per share growth is expected to
consistently exceed the Standard and Poor's 500 index and
return on equity will remain in the 18 to 21 pct range.
    Leo W. Yochum, senior executive vice president for finance,
told the analysts "we will consider buying back stock" but
there are no current plans for such a buyback.
    Yochum said that at the company's current level of earnings
it could comfortably maintain higher debt levels and that
Westinghouse will use its debt capacity to improve shareholder
value.
    Last year, Westinghouse established a 790 mln dlrs
restructuring reserve to be used for plant consolodation,
assett writedowns and other items. Yochum said, the company
spent 306 mln dlrs of that reserve in 1986 and will spend 344
mln dlrs of the reserves in 1987. The balance will be used in
1988. He also said, capital expenditures should be about 400
mln dlrs in 1987.

Ltd, earlier reporting a 1986 loss of 25.6 mln U.S. dlrs, said
it adopted a more conservative accounting policy, similar to
other gold producers' accounting for exploration costs.
    As a result, the company retroactively charged all past
exploration and related administration costs incurred on its
properties against expenses in 1986, 1985 and 1984.
    Under the new policy, all future exploration and related
administration costs will be written off to expenses rather
than capitalized as an intangible asset, it said.
    Galactic said the accounting change resulted in a 22.8 mln
U.S. dlr charge against 1986 earnings. It did not immediately
disclose the affect of the change on prior years' results.
    The new accounting policy is not expected to adversely
affect working capital position, future cash flows or the
company's ability to conduct ongoing business operations, it
said.
    Galactic said the charge includes 9.9 mln U.S. dlrs of
costs concerning its Summitville Mine leach pad and 8.9 mln
U.S. dlrs in waste removal costs, dyke construction and other
mine developments.
    Galactic said under the prior accounting policy, the
Summitville mine expenses would have been amortized over the
life of the mine and charged against future earnings.
    The change will also result in lower depreciation and
amortization charges against income of about 52 U.S. dlrs an
ounce of gold produced in future periods, based on total
estimated reserves of 617,000 ounces.
    Galactic said March leaching production at Summitville is
expected to exceed 2,500 ounces, raising gold equivalent
production since the June 5, 1986 start of leaching to 65,000
ounces.

expects to report a loss of about 800,000 dlrs for the fourth

January 31.
    As a result of the loss, the company said it has decided to
discontinue the operations of its Big Value Outlets division,
which will result in a yet undisclosed one time charge against
earnings for the year.
    The estimated 1.1 mln dlrs year loss or about 50 cts a
share, compares with earnings of 871,000 dlrs or 42 cts a share
recorded last year.
    "The fourth quarter loss was affected by an abnormally high
inventory shrinkage, lower than planned sales and higher
markdowns related to increased promotional activity, all of
which reduced fourth quarter gross margins," the company said.
    In order to concentrate on the company's core business, the
operation of discount and promotional department stores, Mars

with NEC and Bull in both developing new products and marketing
computers to multi-national companies.
    "We haven't been growing as fast as we'd like, but we are

    Honeywell Bull chairman Jacques Stern, who is also chairman

customers want. "I don't believe in the slump of the market,"

    The interest surplus, which fell to 897.9 mln marks from
981.1 mln, was also depressed by the 0.1 point fall in the
interest margin to 1.9 pct.
    A rise in the surplus on commission to 208.8 mln marks from
188.1 mln was not enough to compensate for this.
    The rise in total operating profits enabled BfG to step up
risk provisions, with country risks particularly emphasised
because of the continuing difficulties of some countries.
    Disclosed risk provisions, which under West German
accounting rules do not necessarily reflect the full amount,
rose to 736.3 mln marks from 224.0 mln.
    BfG's parent credit volume eased to 32.63 billion marks in
1986 from 33.51 billion. Foreign debtors accounted for 24 pct
of this credit volume, and Latin American debtors accounted for
14.7 pct of total lending to foreigners.
    BfG posted extraordinary earnings from the sale of 25.01
pct of <Volksfuersorge Deutsche Lebensversicherung AG>, 74.9
pct of <BSV Bank fuer Sparanlagen und Vermoegensbildung AG> and
five pct of <Allgemeine Hypothekenbank AG>. The sale was linked
to AMB's acquisition of a majority of BfG.
    These sales show up as 494.2 mln marks from profit transfer
agreements and 326.5 mln from writing back risk provisions.

steel market makes it important for Arbed SA <ARBB.BR> to
maintain efforts to reduce costs, the company said in a
statement.
    It reported that its competitive position had weakened
considerably in the second half of 1986, leading to a seven pct
cut in steel output over the whole of the year to 3.74 mln
tonnes.
    Arbed had managed to make a 890 mln franc net profit,
slightly down from the 1.12 billion profit in 1985, thanks to
lower raw material costs and prudent management, the company
said.
    Arbed said the early months of 1987 had seen the market
deteriorate further, but the decision of the European Community
to maintain anti-crisis measures, at least provisionally,
should under normal circumstances have a beneficial effect.
    EC ministers have agreed to extend a quota production
system while discussions continue on an industry plan for
capacity reductions.
    Arbed said in current conditions, cost cutting efforts
remain necessary to avoid any weakening of resources which have
been built up over the last three years.

the volatile currency situation last year, particularly the
fall of the dollar, led to sharp drops in turnover denominated
in marks and to price reductions for exports from domestic
production.
    But in a statement accompanying year-end figures, the group
said it expected satisfactory business development over the
next months. "At the moment we do not expect any extraordinary
influences such as there were last year," it said. Orders in
hand and incoming orders were steady at a high level.
    BASF reported 13.6 pct lower 1986 world group pre-tax
profit at 2.63 billion marks compared to 1985.
    The unusual situation on the crude oil market last year
also produced a clear sales slide in the oil and gas sector and
forced price declines for petrochemical products, BASF said.
    The fall in pre-tax profit corresponded to the losses on
stocks in the oil and gas sector at the beginning of 1986. In
the parent company, the positive earnings development
continued, it said, where pre-tax profit rose by 3.2 pct to
1.97 billion marks. The decline in parent company turnover was
balanced out by increased capacity use and price declines in
raw materials. 
    In 1986, world group turnover was off 8.8 pct at 40.47
billion marks compared to 1985, BASF said. Parent turnover fell
8.5 pct to 18.72 billion.
    Turnover increases, with the exceptions of the sectors fine
chemicals and informations systems, had only been achieved in
those areas widened last year through acquisition in 1985.
    Results from these had been taken only partly into the
fourth quarter of that year but fully included in 1986 data.
    So far in the current year, the investment volume of the
parent company and the world group is exceeding that in 1986,
BASF said, without giving concrete figures.

it was well placed to operate in the new circumstances
following the ending in February of the 53-year old cement
manufacturers common price and marketing arrangements.
    In a statement following the release of its 1986 results,
IT stated that the current year had started well. It reported
that pretax profits in the year rose to 35.46 mln stg from
21.84 mln previously on turnover higher at 313.3 mln after
252.2 mln.
    The strong recovery of the first six months continued into
the second half, although U.K. Cement demand rose only
modestly. Results benefitted from cost cutting and higher
volumes.
    The decision by the Cement Makers Federation to end the
pricing agreement reflected pressure from higher competition
due to growing imports and the possibility that the system
would be taken to the Restrictive Practices Court by the U.K.
Government. It stated that its John Carr unit benefitted from
strong organic growth, although overseas its Cockburn operation
had a difficult period with high maintenance costs and
increased depreciation charges.
    The company is proposing to change its name at the next
annual meeting to <Rugby Group Plc>.
    Rugby said it spent 27 mln stg on acquisitions in 1986. It
noted that its Western Australia hotels company had agreed to
sell the Parmelia hotel for 31.5 mln Australian dlrs, some
seven mln stg above end-1986 book value.

its first-quarter results to reach "all-time highs."
    It projected sales exceeding 32 mln dlrs, or up 21 pct from
the 26,488,000 dlrs reported for the 1986 first quarter. It
said the previous high for a single quarter was 27,179,000 dlrs
for the 1986 fourth quarter.
    Walbro estimated income for the quarter will exceed
first-quarter 1986 income, which was 1,953,000 dlrs, or 66 cts
a share, by at least 40 pct. It said the first quarter of 1986
had been the previous income record for a single quarter.
    Walbro cited strong demand for its fuel systems products,
especially automotive electronic fuel injection components and
carburetors for lawn and garden applications.
    However, it said it is unlikely the company will sustain
the same record pace of sales and income throughout 1987, due
to an expected reduction in throttle body sales.
    "It now appears likely that the company's throttle body
business with General Motors Corp <GM> will peak in the first

for chemical products could result in record earnings this
year, Chairman Paul Oreffice said.
    "I'm hoping we will have the best year in our history
profit-wise," he told reporters following a speech at The
American Institute of Chemical Engineers meeting.
    "I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a
record year, or close to it," Oreffice said.
    In 1986, Dow earned 741 mln dlrs an increase from 1985's 58
mln dlrs brought about by falling oil prices and resulting
cheaper feedstock costs.
    Oreffice also said Dow's profit margins on chemical
products would improve this year over last year.
    He said reduced capacity in the chemical industry and the
weakened U.S. dollar would also contribute to the company's
improved performance.
    Dow will spending about 650 mln dlrs on research and
development in 1987 with an emphasis on new specialty
chemicals, Oreffice said.

stiff pressure to declare their Brazilian loans non-performing
if, as expected, major U.S. banks take similar action after the
end of their first quarter tomorrow, analysts said.
    American bankers said last week that slow progress in debt
talks with Brazil increased the likelihood that U.S. banks
would soon declare their Brazilian loans non-performing.
    Such action "would put a lot of pressure on the Canadian
banks to do the same," Levesque, Beaubien Inc Toronto-based bank
analyst Donna Pulcine told Reuters.
    "They (banks) like to appear to be conservative," said
Pulcine, "and if a major bank puts loans on a non-performing
basis and the Canadian banks don't, there is going to be a lot
of pressure from shareholders as to why one bank is considering
the loans non-performing and another bank is not."
    Wood Gundy Inc bank analyst Patricia Meredith said any
willingness by a major Brazilian bank creditor such as Citicorp
<CCI> to declare its Brazilian loans non-performing rather than
let Brazil dictate settlement terms would provide a compelling
example for other creditor banks.
    "In order to make that strategy work, they (Citicorp) have
to have the support of the other banks," said Meredith.
    Bank analyst Michael Walsh at First Marathon Securities Ltd
said at least one Canadian bank, which he declined to identify,
"wants to put (the Brazilian loans) on a non-performing basis
and is trying to encourage the others to take that position."
    Canadian banks are owed about seven billion Canadian dlrs
by Brazil, which late last month suspended interest payments on
its 68 billion U.S. dlr foreign bank debt.
    Banks in Canada, although allowed to wait up to 180 days
before declaring loans on which they are receiving no interest
as non-performing, usually move on such loans within 90 days.
They could therefore delay action on the Brazilian loans until
late May, which falls in Canadian banks' third quarter ending
July 31.
    <Bank of Montreal>, Brazil's largest Canadian bank
creditor, said last week it was not currently considering
declaring its 1.98 billion dlrs of Brazilian loans as
non-performing.
    "I think that is just for the benefit of the public," Walsh
said of Bank of Montreal's statement. 
    Some analysts predicted minimal earnings impact on Canadian
banks from a move to declare the Brazilian loans
non-performing.
    They said Brazil would likely resume interest payments by
the banks' fiscal year-end on October 31, thus allowing banks
to recoup their lost interest income.
    "From what Brazil has said, it is quite likely the banks
will get the money," said Meredith. "My outlook at this point is
optimistic that there will be no adjustment for the full-year's
earnings."
    Meredith forecast 1987 fully diluted per share earnings of
3.80 dlrs for <Royal Bank of Canada> compared with 3.74 in
1986; 4.30 dlrs for <Bank of Montreal> compared with 3.59; 2.25
dlrs for <Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce> compared with
2.23;  2.15 dlrs for <Bank of Nova Scotia> compared with 1.94,
and 2.85 dlrs for <Toronto Dominion Bank> against 2.74.
    She forecast 1.90 dlrs for <National Bank of Canada>
against 3.30 dlrs before a two for one stock split.
    Analyst Pulcine said she might lower full-year earnings
estimates for the banks by between two cts and 10 cts a share,
assuming a possible settlement reduced Brazil's interest costs.
    "If the banks didn't receive anything for the rest of the
fiscal year, the impact could range from 16 cts to 70 cts a
share. But I don't see that as a likely scenario," Pulcine said.
    Walsh at First Marathon suggested, however, that the
Brazilian debt situation was so complex that "it could drag on
beyond one full fiscal year."
    He said he foresaw having to lower his 1987 fiscal earnings
forecasts for the banks. He estimated that Brazil's yearly
interest payments to Canadian banks totaled about 575 mln dlrs
or about 10 pct of their total 1986 pre-tax earnings.

 ]]></BODY><BODY><![CDATA[Woodside Petroleum Ltd <WPLA.S> said
its 1986 net loss largely reflected the drop in oil prices
combined with a large tax provision.
    Woodside earlier reported attributable net loss rose to
17.14 mln dlrs in 1986 from 8.73 mln in 1985, although group
revenue rose to 220.84 mln from 173.50 mln.
    It said it should have received a 1.7 mln dlr tax credit
but instead made a 10.04 mln dlr tax provision. This largely
related to its <Vamgas Ltd> unit, non-allowable exchange losses
and tax benefits from the North-West Shelf project not
recognised in the accounts.
    Woodside said the rise in revenue largely reflected full
year sales of gas and condensate from the domestic phase of the
Shelf project, against six month sales in 1985.
    Offsetting this was a 23 pct fall in the Cooper Basin gas
and liquids revenue of its 50.6 pct-owned Vamgas unit.

dividend of nine marks would be proposed for ordinary
shareholders on 1986 earnings after eight in 1985.
    It added in a statement that parent net profit rose to
288.2 mln marks in 1986 from 221.7 mln the prior year.
    A Commerzbank spokesman noted the figures were,however,
preliminary and required approval of the bank's supervisory
board which meets today.
    The Commerzbank statement added the distributable profit
last year rose to 228.2 mln marks from 161.7 mln in 1985.
    With inclusion of the corporate tax allowance, qualifying
domestic shareholders would receive an effective dividend of
14.06 marks per share.
    Total dividend payout would rise to 186.8 mln marks from
142.0 mln on 1985 earnings due to the increase in the dividend
and in equity capital, it added.
    From the parent net profit, 60 mln marks would be placed in
published reserves, unchanged from the two prior years.
    The shareholders' meeting take place on May 22 in Hamburg.
    The statement said holders of Commerzbank participation
certificates in a total nominal value of 425 mln marks would
receive the remaining 41.4 mln marks of the distributable
profit. Aside from the basic payment of 8.25 pct of nominal
value, certificate holders would receive an additional 1.5 pct.
    The management board of the bank would also propose two
capital measures to shareholders in order to be able to react
quickly to new challenges.
    It would ask for authorised capital of a nominal 200 mln
marks for the issue of new shares and for 300 mln for the issue
of warrant bonds, both for the period until April 30, 1992.

(Lasmo) <LASL.L> will have an advantage when oil prices rise
again and it is confident this will happen early in the next
decade, the company said in a statement accompanying results.
    Lasmo said its advantage comes from its reserves of oil and
gas which at the end of 1986 stood at 210 mln barrels of oil
equivalent, a group record. Reserves have increased every year
since 1983 at a compounded rate of 10 pct a year.
    The company reported a 1986 pretax profit of 4.4 mln stg,
down from 118 mln in 1985.
    It said falling oil prices caused the downturn.
    The company said it reacted swiftly to the sharp drop in
oil prices which began over a year ago. Capital expenditure,
which had been budgeted at over 150 mln stg, was cut to 51 mln
stg net of disposals. Managers responded well to the demand for
lower operating costs and this has been achieved worldwide.
    The company said had very few exploration wells committed
for 1987 and therefore retains maximum flexibility in its
exploration program. Even without further success, the existing
fields and recent discoveries will contribute significantly to
profit and cash flow for some years to come, it said.
    Lasmo shares were down 2p at 251 after the announcement.

difficult year for the capital goods industry in 1987, chief
executive Werner Dieter told a news conference.
    Dieter said West German producers would see a downturn in
foreign business because of lower energy prices and the higher
mark, as well as a deterioration of the economies of customer
nations.
    Domestic business was also declining and orders for West
German engineering goods have been falling since July 1986,
Dieter said.
    Mannesmann's profit fell by an undisclosed amount in 1986.
    Dieter said Mannesmann's pipe activities would suffer a
set- back, although measures to cut costs, which were started
last year, were now having an effect.
    Dieter noted, however, that pipes and related products
accounted for less than 30 pct of Mannesmann's turnover. The
company saw good chances in the automation sector, which Dieter
said had become one of Mannesmann's "strategic aims."
    He said the company's drive to combine activities in
mechanical and electronic engineering was a particular "plus
point" for Mannesmann.
    Mannesmann, which yesterday announced it had agreed to take
a majority stake in the Fichtel und Sachs AG car parts group
for an undisclosed sum, saw third party group turnover fall
nine pct in 1986 to 16.60 billion marks. Its world group net
profit in 1985 was 255.9 mln marks.
    It has blamed the fall in 1986 profits on the weaker dollar
and lack of demand for steel pipe.
    Dieter said there were signs that prices for steel pipe
were bottoming out and would slowly start to rise, but he added
the company would continue to cut personnel in this sector this
year.

second largest airline, has announced a 19.3 mln stg pretax
loss for the financial year ending last October, compared with
a record pre-tax profit of 21.7 mln stg in 1985, chairman Sir
Adam Thomson told reporters.
    A decline in U.S. Transatlantic traffic following terrorist
attacks in Europe, the U.S. Bombing of the Libya, the Chernobyl
disaster and a slump in the oil industry which affected Middle
East traffic were the main causes of the loss, Thomson said.
    He said the poor results were caused by "a range of
exceptional circumstances wholly outside our direct control" and
predicted a return to profitability this year.
    Last year, the airline was forced to axe 1,000 jobs, sell
some of its assets and cut the number of its flights across the
Atlantic and to the Middle East following the fall in business
.

interest costs from borrowings to make acquisitions will
produce earnings flat with last year's 59 cts a share results.
    Arvin said it might earn 57 cts to 60 cts a share in the
quarter.
    These results also reflect the seasonally low sales pattern
of automotive replacement parts in that period.
    Arvin forecast about 85 cts a share net in the second
quarter compared with 68 cts in last year's period.
    The company said revenues for full year 1987 it will exceed
1.4 billion dlrs, net earnings will increase more than 30 pct,
while per share earnings should increase 12 to 18 pct.
    Arvin's 1986 revenues were 995.6 mln, net reached 41.2 mln
and earnings per share 2.46 dlrs.
    It based these forecasts due to the addition of Schrader
Automotive Inc and Maremont Corp, both acquired last year.
    Chairman James Baker said 1987 quarterly comparisons will
not conform to historical patterns for the year because the
acquisitions of Schrader and Maremond occurred in different
quarters.
    He said Arvin will complete the purchase of Systems
Research Laboratories in the second quarter of 1987. This will
also increase revenues.

    The company, which lowered the payout from 27 cts to 26 cts

    The company said the reason for the cutbacks was because it

a recent merger that creates a powerful new competitor for
government-owned Air Canada, has begun its first serious drive
for profitability in 50 years, industry analysts said.
    "Now we've got a company that can compete with Air Canada,"
said Thomas Bradley of Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd.
"Clearly, it can go head-to-head in any market."
    The new airline, which arose from the 300-mln-Canadian-dlr
takeover of Canadian Pacific Air Lines Ltd by the small but
cash-rich Pacific Western Airlines Corp, was launched last week
as Canadian Airlines International Ltd.
    Canadian Airlines will have 35-40 pct of the
6-billion-Canadian-dlr domestic market, against Air Canada's
50-55 pct. Wardair International Ltd is third with about nine
pct.
    Analysts believe Pacific Western's aggressive and
cost-conscious chairman Rhys Eyton will develop the true
potential of the former CP Air, which floundered for four
decades inside the bureaucracy of conglomerate Canadian Pacific
Ltd.
    They said CP Air's management style had been not much
different from that of Air Canada, formed 50 years ago, because
neither airline was held accountable to its owners.
    "Not that long ago, maybe even just six months ago, these
two airlines were totally fiscally irresponsible. Neither
seemed that concerned about the bottom line," said Bradley.
    "But with CP Air being run by Eyton, it will be very
conscious of profitability and shareholder return. And Air
Canada is on the verge of going that way," he said.
    CP Air, always fighting for market share rather than
profits, was "a perennial money-loser," analyst Wilfred Hahn of
Bache Securities Inc said in a recent report.
    Prior to its takeover in December, it had accumulated
long-term debt of 600 mln Canadian dlrs. From 1981 to 1985, its
losses totaled 87 mln Canadian dlrs.
    Air Canada, widely expected to be privatized later this
year in a public share offering, lost 14.8 mln Canadian dlrs on
revenues of 2.72 billion dlrs in 1985. It has a debt of more
than 2 billion dlrs.
    Although only a minority interest is likely to be sold to
the public, the prospect of privatization at a time of
increased competition is forcing Air Canada to pay more
attention to finances, analysts said.
    It recently disclosed that it expects to report a profit "in
excess of 35 mln to 40 mln dlrs" for 1986. However, this profit
recovery was due less to management skill than the fact that
all Canadian airlines had a good year in 1986, analysts said.
    Tourists came to Canada in record numbers last year,
attracted by the relatively weak Canadian dollar and Expo 86 in
Vancouver, which alone had more than 22 mln visitors.
    For the next few years, most analysts see three-six pct air
traffic growth, and they expect profits will come from
cost-cutting and careful spending.
    Peter Friend of Walywn Stodgell Cochran Murray Ltd said
institutional buyers will be eager to add Air Canada to their
portfolios as a blue-chip investment, but warned that new
competition makes profit growth less certain.
    "The airline with something to lose will be Air Canada. At
one time, it had a fixed system which was theirs and nobody
else's," Friend said.
    Many analysts recommend that investors buy and hold airline
shares for at least a year.
    Analysts said Air Canada's immediate concern ahead of a
public stock offering will be unloading unprofitable air routes
without setting off a political storm.
    It also will be faced with an expensive but necessary
updating of its aging fleet of 111 aircraft.
    Wardair, preferring strong medicine now instead of later,
already has embarked on a one-billion-Canadian-dlr purchase of
a dozen aircraft from Europe's Airbus Industrie.
    Canadian Airlines, which has 81 aircraft, last week ordered
six commuter planes from British Aerospace and said it would
soon buy as many as six wide-bodied aircraft from Airbus or the
Boeing Co.
    Analysts said Canadian Airlines, with its newer fleet,
needs to make fewer replacements and can afford these without
hurting profits.
    Steven Garmaise of Wood Gundy Inc expects Canadian
Airlines' profit in 1988 will more than double last year's 29.8
mln Canadian dlrs by Pacific Western.

show a profit in the next quarter and will probably not show a
profit in 1987.
    Speaking at the annual shareholders meeting, chairman
Nelson Peltz declined to estimate when the company would become
profitable.
    Peltz said Uniroyal Chemical Co, acquired last year, would
increase Avery's operating earnings but that associated
acquisition costs would prevent Avery from posting net profits
for some time.
    At the meeting, stockholders approved an increase in the
authorized number of common shares to 200 mln from 15 mln.
    In the fiscal year ended May 30, 1986, Avery reported a
loss of 489,000 dlrs. The company has changed its fiscal year
to end Sept 30.
    The increase in common shares would cover, among other
things, the exercise of Triangle Industries Inc's <TRI> and
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc's warrants issued in relation to
Avery's 710 mln dlr acquisition of Uniroyal Chemical late last
year.

to 23 in what analysts said was a reaction to a surprise
announcement earlier today by the company that earnings in the
fiscal year ended January 31 will decline sharply.
    Ames said it expects to report earnings of between 72 and
77 cts per share compared with 1.19 dlrs per share in the
previous year.
    "We were looking for 1.15 dlrs," said an analyst at a major
Wall Street firm who declined to be identified. Ames said most
of the decline resulted from an inventory shortage at its
Secaucus, N.J. distribution center.
    "The obvious suspicion is that there has been some kind of
fraud or theft," said Ralph Shulansky, senior vice president of
Ames. "We do not have hard evidence we are still putting things
together."
    He said it would take several weeks for the company to
complete an investigation. He said there are no law enforcement
officials involved at this time.
    He declined to quantify the inventory shortage but said it
was the major reason for the decline in earnings. A decline in
gross margin percentage and an increase in the effective tax
rate also contributed to the downturn, Ames said.

expects earnings to rise significantly in 1987 and said it is
actively seeking an acquisition.
    The property and casualty insurance company's chairman and
chief executive officer, Martin J. Simon, told Reuters in an
interview that he expects earnings of 33 cts a share in 1987
compared with 25 cts a year ago.
    He said, "the company currently has the sufficient momentum
to achieve those earnings and the successful completion of
licensing applications to operate in Pennsylvania, Delaware,
Connecticut and Ohio should fuel our earnings."
    The company is currently licenced to operate only in New
York state.
    Simon estimated that the company would earn seven cts a
share in the first quarter compared to three cts in the same
quarter a year ago, and eight cts a share in the second quarter
compared to five cts earned in 1986. He expects the company to
earn nine cts a share for each of the final two quarters of
1987.
    In addition, Simon said, First Central Financial "is
actively looking for, and has several acquisition brokers
looking for a small life insurance company to acquire."
    He said the acquisition should be in the 10 mln dlr range
and will be part of a strategy of expanding the company into a
"wide spectrum of insurance services." No specific company has
been targeted as yet, "but I would like to make my first
acquisition in 1987," he said.
    He said First Central Financial would not itself be an easy
takeover target. It wants to remain independent, he said, and
has implemented a staggered board of directors system. In
addition, Simon, the company's biggest shareholder, holds about
960,000 of the 6.2 mln ouitstanding shares.

 ]]></BODY><BODY><![CDATA[Dome Petroleum Ltd, earlier
reporting a 2.20 billion dlr 1986 loss compared to year-earlier
profit of 7.0 mln dlrs, said the loss was mainly due to write
downs totalling 2.084 billion dlrs before a reduction in
deferred income taxes of 571 mln dlrs.
    The loss also includes 214 mln dlrs in accumulated foreign
exchange losses, the company said.
    "The dramatic drop in energy prices in early 1986 reverses
much of the progress the company has made in the two previous
years," Dome chairman J. Howard Macdonald said in a statement.
    "But even a net loss of this magnitude has very little
bearing on the day-to-day operations of Dome," chairman
Macdonald said.
    "It merely reflects the realistic carrying value of the
company's assets in today's economic environment, and the
absolute need for reaching a timely agreement with our lenders
on a debt restructuring plan to assure the company's continued
existence," he added.
    Dome is now trying to reach agreement on a complex plan for
restructuring debt of more than 6.10 billion dlrs.
    Dome said it charged the 214 mln dlrs in accumulated
foreign exchange losses to current expenses because of the
uncertainty arising from its proposed restructuring plan.
    Normally the expenses would be amortized over the remaining
period of the loans to which they apply, it said.
    Dome also said the write downs included a fourth quarter
reduction in the value of its oil and gas properties of 1.20
billion dlrs, before a reduction in deferred income taxes of
305 mln dlrs. The fourth quarter writedown was in addition to a
charge of 880 mln dlrs on certain other assets, taken mainly in
the third quarter.
    Dome said the 1.20 billion dlr fourth quarter charge
resulted from a year-end accounting change made under new full
cost accounting guidelines by the Canadian Institute of
Chartered Accountants.
    The company said it previously determined a write down of
conventional oil and gas properties was not required at
September 30, under the previous method of calculating the
limitation of oil and gas values.
    Dome said the most significant accounting change under the
new guidelines is using current oil and gas prices in
calculations instead of escalating price forecasts.
    Terms of Dome's proposed debt restructuring plan preclude
the company from making an accurate estimate of future
financing costs, which are used in the new accounting
calculations, it said.
    As a result, Dome adopted current prices and costs and a 10
pct discount factor in the calculations, which substantially
conform with accounting rules prescribed by the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission, the company said.
    Dome said operating income from its crude oil and natural
gas segments fell by 2.50 billion dlrs to a 1986 loss of 1.71
billion dlrs from prior year earnings of 737.0 mln dlrs.
    Dome said the steep drop in crude oil and natural gas
operating income was due to write downs totalling 1.93 billion
dlrs and lower energy prices that sharply reduced revenue.
    Reduced production of natural gas and lower utilization of
Dome's offshore drilling fleet in the Beaufort Sea also
contributed to the decline, it said.
    Earnings from its natural gas liquids business fell by 79
pct to 42.0 mln dlrs from 199 mln dlrs in 1985.
    Cash from operations dropped to 5.0 mln dlrs from year-ago
542.0 mln dlrs and unrestricted cash balance declined to 202.0
mln dlrs from 466.0 mln dlrs.
    Dome said 1986 crude oil production in 1986 was maintained
at prior year's levels through new drilling activity and
improvements in productivity.
    Natural gas production fell by nine pct as a result of
lower domestic and export sales, it said.
    Oil and field natural gas liquids production totalled
86,000 barrels a day, compared to 87,000 bpd in the prior year.
    Natural gas production fell to 536.0 mln cubic feet a day
from 591.0 mcf a day.

it expects to record a 470 mln dlr, or 1.25 dlr per share,
reduction in 1987 earnings because of the company's decision to
change the method used to record Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power
Plant revenues.
    The accounting change will not affect the company's cash
position and the company intends to continue paying its
dividend at the annual rate of 1.92 dlrs per share.
    Last year Pacific Gas reported earnings of 925 mln dlrs, or
2.60 dlrs per share.
    Pacific Gas said the accounting change was prompted by
delays in the receipt of a California Public Utilities
Commission decision on the company's 1984 application for rate
relief to recover the 5.8 billion dlr cost of constructing
units one and two of the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Project.
    It said the commission is currently allowing the company to
recover 40 pct of the cost of owning and operating the plants.
    As a result, 63 mln dlrs has been accumulating each month
as deferred non-cash account receivable, which has been
included in current income.
    But the accounting change, effective January 1, will
reflect only cash received through interim rates approved by
the commission, Pacific Gas and Electric said.
    It also said the commission is now awaiting its Public
Staff Division's report which will recommend how much of the
5.8 billion dlr investment Pacific Gas should be allowed to
recover in rates.
    The company further stated that it is confident it will
receive an objective review of the facts.
    It also said it intends to seek additional interim rates.
    Pacific Gas began construction of the two nuclear power
units in 1969. After a number of construction delays, unit one
went into operation in May 1985 and unit two went on line in
March last year.

a record 402 mln dlrs in 1986, said in its annual report it
expected operating losses to continue "for the foreseeable
future" as it continues to search for additional capital or a
merger partner.
    The Houston-based bank's 1986 financial statements received
a qualified opinion from its auditors, Arthur Andersen and Co.
The auditors said their opinion was subject to First City
eventually obtaining additional capital.
    "The company believes that in order to address its
long-term needs and return to a satisfactory level of
operations, it will ultimately need several hundred million
dollars of additional capital, or a combination with a more
strongly capitalized entity," First City said in a note to its
financial statements included in the annual report.
    "Management believes that sufficient resources should be
available to cover interim capital concerns while additional
capital is being sought," the bank said.
    To raise cash in the near-term, First City said it may sell
or mortgage non-strategic assets, recover excess contributions
to its pension plan and obtain special dividends from some of
its member banks.
    "The losses for 1987 are expected to be substantially less
than in 1986," First City chairman J.A. Elkins said in a letter
included in the annual report. "However, the ultimate return to
satisfactory operating conditions is dependent on the
successful resolution of the related problems of credit
quality, funding and the eventual need for substantial
additional capital."
    First City said it anticipated that certain covenants of a
credit agreement with unaffiliated banks requiring most of
First City's excess cash to be applied to debt repayments would
be modified by the end of the first quarter in order to avoid
default.
    The banks agreed to similar amendments to the covenants
last year and First City has reduced its borrowings from 120
mln dlrs at 1986 yearend to 68.5 mln dlrs in recent weeks.
    Although the parent company's capital adequacy ratios
exceeded regulatory minimum requirements at the end of 1986,
First City said its two largest subsidiaries did not. First
City National Bank of Houston had a primary capital ratio of
5.34 pct and First City Bank of Dallas had a 4.75 pct ratio.
    Hard-hit by the collapse in oil and Texas real estate
prices, First City's net loan chargeoffs totaled 366 mln dlrs
last year, up from 261 mln dlrs in 1985. The bank more than
doubled its loan loss provision to 497 mln dlrs at the end of
1986.
    First City said chargeoffs and paydowns reduced its total
energy loan portfolio by 32 pct during 1986, to 1.4 billion
dlrs at year-end, adding that future energy chargeoffs "should
be more modest." The amount represented 15 pct of First City's
total loans.
    In real estate, First City said its nonperforming assets
nearly doubled last year to 347 mln dlrs at year-end.
Chargeoffs of real estate loans rose to 32 mln dlrs, or nine
pct of total loan chargeoffs, and the bank said the amount
could go higher.
    "The company still faces uncertainties in the real estate
market and anticipates further deterioration in the pportfolio
so long as the regional recession persists," First City said.
"Because the carrying value of many of these loans is
collateral dependent, a further decline in the overall value of
the collateral base could cause an increase in the level of
real estate-related chargeoffs."

board chairman Walter Seipp said that from the present
viewpoint the bank must expect 1987 full operating profit to be
lower than in 1986.
    In the first two months of the year, partial operating
profit -- excluding trading on the bank's own account -
declined, he said, without giving details.
    The interest surplus fell 2.8 pct compared with 2/12ths of
1986 results, while the commission surplus, because of the
quiet stock exchange business, fell back still more strongly.
By contrast the personnel and fixed asset expenses increased.
    German banks do not report full operating profit. But Seipp
said last year the figure for the first time had topped one
billion marks for the parent bank, and the group result was
around 50 pct higher than this.
    Commenting on 1986, Seipp said, "we were able to raise the
full operating profit...Slightly above the record result of
1985 because own account profits increased slightly."
    He gave no concrete details but added that in January and
February, good own account trading profits meant that the drop
in full operating earnings was more modest than that in the
partial operating figure.
    The bank would, as a result, be more profit-oriented in
future, developing, for example, more into investment banking,
keeping a tight rein on personnel costs and dampening
expenditures on fixed assets.
    Turning to 1986 results, Seipp said by year end there had
been a strong growth in business volume.
    Over the year business volume rose by 9.9 pct to 93.2
billion marks compared with 1985, Seipp added.
    Group balance sheet volume rose by 8.0 pct to 148.15
billion. It would have been around five billion marks higher
still if currency relationships had remained unchanged.
    In the parent bank, the interest surplus rose nine pct in
the year, while the interest margin held roughly at 1985's 2.56
pct despite pressure on credit rates.
    The surplus on commission business, which had soared by a
quarter in 1985, rose by 11.6 pct last year thanks almost
exclusively to growth in securities commissions, Seipp said.
    Personnel expenditure was up 11.9 pct last year, at more
than 1.5 billion marks. Fixed asset expenditure rose by 9.6 pct
to more than 650 mln.
    As a result, the parent bank partial operating profit rose
by 3.2 pct to 752 mln marks.
    Parent bank tax payment rose to 244 mln marks last year
from 233 mln in 1985.
    Seipp said extraordinary earnings included a "high
two-figure million" in profit from the sale of the bank's AEG AG
<AEGG.F> shares to Daimler-Benz AG <DAIG.F> during the latter's
majority stake purchase booked last year.
    The ability of the bank to write off depreciations in
credit business against profits from securities trading and
earnings on the sale of stakes had been utilised, as in prior
years, to its full extent.
    Because of numerous insolvencies at home, by far the
largest part of the provisions were set aside for individual
write-downs from domestic business. Abroad, the circle of
problem debtor countries rose last year, although the ratio of
credit exposure to provisions improved further.
    Seipp said that because about half the group's exposure to
problem nations was in dollars, the bank had swapped into
dollars individual provisions hitherto held primarily in marks.
    "This means that no open currency positions exist any longer
on the amount of the provision that is made against an actual
default," he added.
    Despite the increase in concern over debtor nations in the
last few weeks, he said, the international banking community is
better armed than it was against payment problems.
    All banks had significantly strengthened their capital
base, most European banks had made considerable provisions
against bad debts while goverments and central banks were
better prepared for unforseen difficulties.
    He described debt-equity swaps as a very interesting new
approach to indebted nations' problems. There was a lot of
interest in direct investment via an equity participation in
Latin America, particularly from West German firms.

this month into two separate companies, expects to show
improved earnings in 1987 over last year, executives of the new
company told Reuters.
    Charles Blackburn, president and chief executive officer of
Diamond Shamrock and the new company, which will emphasize
exploration and production, said, "Earnings wil be better than
in 1986." He declined to say how much better.
    In 1986 Diamond Shamrock reported a loss of 115.6 mln dlrs
on total revenues of 2.543 billion dlrs. Exploration and
production lost 18.5 mln dlrs on revenues of 593.5 mln dlrs.
    Roger Hemminghaus, Diamond Shamrock vice president and
soon-to-be chief executive of the spin-off Diamond Shamrock
Refining and Marketing Co, said, "Refining and marketing is a
margin business. The margins will return and this will be a
better year than 1986."
    In 1986, refining and marketing showed operating profits of
40.1 mln dlrs on revenues of 1.636 billion dlrs.
    "We are also expecting to be in the black in the first
quarter (1987)," Heminghaus added. In the first quarter of 1986,
the refining and marketing segment showed a loss of 27.1 mln
dlrs on revenues of 492.1 mln dlrs.
   
    The executives were in New york for meetings with
institutional investors aimed at increasing interest in the
company's stock.
    On the New York Stock Exchange, Diamond Shamrock was
trading at 16-1/4, down 1/4.
    Earlier this year, T. Boone Pickens offered 15 dlrs a share
for Diamond Shamrock, and management countered with an offer at
17 dlrs and a decision to split off the refining and marketing
operation to its shareholders.
    "Our advisors convinced us the market would give higher
multiples for pure plays," Blackburn said.

said that the company will likely attain revenues in excess of
two billion dlrs in its first year of operations.
    The company, created last October with initial equity of
400 mln dlrs, is owned equally by the Equitable Life Assurance
Society of the U.S. and Hospital Corp of America <HCA>.
    Financial results for the first six months of the company's
operations were not disclosed. Equicor provides employee group
plans to 1,500 corporations nationwide. It said it aims to
double its marketshare in five years from the about 3.5 pct of
the employee benefits industry it controls.

sharply after analyst Eugene Nowak of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc
raised his earnings estmates of the company, traders said.
    ARCO jumped 1-3/4 to 81-3/4.
    Nowak said that based on an average oil price of 17 dlrs a
barrel in 1987, the company should earn about 4.50 dlrs a
share. Next year, based on an average oil price of 18 dlrs a
barrel, ARCO should earn about five dlrs a share. The company
earned 3.38 dlrs a share in 1986. "If oil prices should rise to
an average of 20 dlrs a barrel," he said, "ARCO could record
earnings of 6.50 dlrs a share.
    Nowak said his increased estimates come after the company
told analysts yesterday that its first quarter earnings will
comfortably cover its quarterly dividend requirement of one dlr
a share.
    Nowak said, "The company has done an outstanding job
reducing expenses, and ARCO is poised to generate greater
earnings power." He said first quarter earnings will likely
exceed the company's expectations stated yesterday and be in
the 1.15-1.20 dlr-a-share range.

assuming cash interest payments are not received for the rest
of the year, 1987 net income would be reduced by about 72 mln
dlrs. 1986 net income was 872.5 mln dlrs.
    Although U.S. banks do not have to put loans on nonaccrual
until they are over 90 days past due, Morgan said some of the
loans affected by the Brazil payment freeze may reach the
90-day limit during the second and third quarters.
    Morgan said it assumes talks between Brazil and commercial
bank lenders will proceed "expeditiously" and interest payments
will resume at the earliest practicable date.

and Exchange Commission it had net profits of 16,465,000 on
sales of 1.61 billion dlrs for the year ended Dec. 31, 1986.
    Revlon in a filing with the SEC compared the results to the
five months ending Dec. 31, 1985. In that period, it lost 28.4
mln dlrs on sales of 262.4 mln dlrs.
    Earlier today, MacAndrews and Forbes Group Inc began an
18.50 dlr a share cash offer for all common stock of Revlon it
does not own. Revlon today rose 3/8 to 19-1/4 in active
trading. MacAndrews controls 31.8 pct of the voting power.

    For 1986, Revlon said the loss applicable to common stock
after preferred dividends is 9.5 mln dlrs. The net loss per
share was 24 cts, compared to a net loss of 99 cts per share
last year.
    Revlon said it had a 1986 operating profit of 64.3 mln

    The 1986 net includes a provision for estimated loss on

placed 1.4 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to

that income will be recorded only when actual cash payments are

    As a result, net income for the first quarter will be

    If Brazil, which suspended interest payments on its term
debt on February 20, continues to defer interest payments for
the rest of the year, net income for the whole of 1987 would be

    U.S. bank accounting guidelines do not require loans to be
placed on nonaccrual unless interest payments are past due 90

light of current circumstances, it was more appropriate to
record income on its Brazilian loans only when cash payments

    It added that it believes Brazil will reach agreement with
its banks on a debt restructuring and that all interest

 ]]></BODY><BODY><![CDATA[Deutsche Bank AG <DBKG.F> has seen a
slow start to 1987 after posting record profits in 1986,
management board joint spokesman F. Wilhelm Christians said.
    Credit business declined in the first few weeks of the
year, and the interest margin was squeezed further. The weak
German bourse saw earnings on commission fall sharply, and
trading in securities also fell. But earnings from currency
dealing were still satisfactory, he told a news conference.
    Deutsche group partial operating profits rose to 3.78
billion marks in 1986 from 2.92 billion in 1985 on a balance
sheet of 257.22 billion marks after 237.23 billion.
    Profits were swollen by earnings from the placement of the
former Flick group, which have been estimated at some one
billion marks, and from record profits in trading on the bank's
own account, not included in partial operating profits.
    Earnings from the Flick transaction were booked through a
subsidiary, and therefore showed up as part of the interest
surplus in a section current earnings from securities and
participations.
    In the group this nearly doubled to 2.64 billion marks from
1.45 billion.
    As usual the bank did not detail total operating profits.
    But it said that total operating profits, including own
account trading, rose 24.9 pct or 4.5 pct without the Flick
transaction in the group, and 35.1 pct or seven pct in the
parent bank.
    Banking analysts said this put group total operating
profits at some 6-1/2 to seven billion marks, and parent bank
operating profits at over five billion marks.
    Christians said Deutsche used the extraordinary earnings
from Flick to pay a record five mark bonus on top of its
unchanged 12 mark dividend.
    The bank had decided against raising the dividend itself
because of the uncertain business outlook at the end of 1986,
and developments so far this year showed that was correct,
Christians said.
    West German banks rarely raise dividends unless they are
sure they can maintain the increased payout in subsequent
years, preferring to use bonuses for one-of profits.
    The bank also used its extraordinary earnings to continue a
high level of risk provision, Christians said.
    Disclosed group risk provisions rose to 867 mln marks in
1986 from 765 mln in 1985.
    Under German law, disclosed provisions do not necessarily
reflect the full amount of risk provisions.
    Management board joint spokesman Alfred Herrhausen said
Deutsche's total debt exposure to problem countries had fallen
to over six billion marks in 1986 from 7.4 billion in 1985
because of the fall in the dollar.
    He agreed with a questioner who asked if over two thirds of
such problem country debt had been written off.
    Deutsche Bank posted a sharp rise in holdings of "other
securities," to 4.64 billion marks from 2.71 billion in the
parent bank.
    Christians said this 1.93-billion-mark rise was partly due
to its increased activity in international share placements,
with some shares such as those from Fiat SpA's international
placement last year remaining on its books.
    Herrhausen said that no concrete measures were planned to
place these shares and conclude the original placement.

diversifying and gradually shifting their asset holdings from
loans to debt instruments, banking sources said.
    The banks following the trend are the <Overseas Union Bank
Ltd>, <United Overseas Bank Ltd>, <Oversea-Chinese Banking
Corporation> and the <Development Bank of Singapore Ltd>.
    The shift towards securitisation has been helped by
volatile financial markets which have developed hedging
facilities such as floating rate notes and bonds for risk
management, said Overseas Union General Manager Loh Hoon Sun.
    Loh told Reuters in an interview that Singapore banks see
limited growth in credit risk. More and more of them are
switching from term lending to major growth areas such as
stockbroking and fee based income, he said.
    Major local banks ventured into stockbroking after being
granted seats on the stock exchange. Bankers said they are now
moving into the new government securities market and the Stock
Exchange of Singapore Dealing and Quotation System.
    One foreign banker said the Development Bank and the
Overseas Union Bank Ltd have become major players in the equity
market in Singapore.
    Loh said the banks' participation in the stock market has
increased business transactions and provided long term growth
for the market. The banks are not competition for individual
stockbroking firms because of the increased business they
generate, he added.
    Loh said the Stock Exchange of Singapore might expand
equity issues by as much as one billion dlrs this year because
of the increasing ability of foreign and local market
participants to absorb new issues.
    Loh said <OUB Investment management Ltd>, a subsidiary of
the Overseas Union Bank Ltd, has teamed up with a U.K. Firm to
launch the Union Global Fund. The fund is for local investors
seeking capital growth through a diversified international
portfolio. It will invest in international shares with the
emphasis on U.S. And Japanese markets, he said.
    <DBS Securities Singapore Pte Ltd>, a subsidiary of the
Development Bank of Singapore, has applied to the Hong Kong
Stock Exchange to set up a Hong Kong stockbroking firm.
    Loh predicted fixed deposit and prime interest rates in
Singapore will stay low this year. As a result, banks will be
forced to provide fund management services for major clients
seeking better returns, he said.
    Economic analysts and bankers are optimistic the major
banks will show profits in 1987, helped by higher income from
treasury and investment banking activities.
    They expect the 1987 after-tax profits of Oversea-Chinese
and United Overseas to show stable growth of four to eight pct
against respective gains of four and seven pct in 1986.
    Overseas Union's profits are expected to jump to over 40
mln dlrs from seven mln dlrs in 1986, economists said.
    The Development Bank's after-tax profits rose 39.2 pct in
1986 mainly due to a dividend of 20.4 mln dlrs paid by
<National Discount Company Ltd> before it became a subsidiary
of the bank, they said.

AG <BAYG.F> said it expects to post another good result in 1987
after raising pre-tax profit to a new record high in 1986.
    The company said that this was despite the mark's further
strengthening against the dollar and other currencies and
despite an increase in competitive pressure.
    "The further progress of our business will depend largely on
the extent to which threats to free trade materialise and on
the developments of exchange rates, raw material and energy
costs.
    Bayer said world group pre-tax profit rose to 3.30 billion
marks in 1986, exceeding the previous year's record of 3.15
billion. Parent company pre-tax profit increased to 1.72
billion from 1.62 billion.
    The company gave no net profit figures or any indication of
the likely 1986 dividend. Bayer paid a 10-mark dividend on 1985
results, up one mark from a year earlier.
    Bayer said that world group operating profit declined
slightly in 1986 against 1985 but non-operating results showed
a further improvement.
    Bayer said that the decline in world group turnover to
40.75 billion marks from 45.93 billion in 1985 reflected mainly
the sharp fall in the dollar against the mark.
    Lower prices on the raw material side had also brought
pressure on selling prices, it added.
    In volume terms, however, 1986 sales rose slightly against
1985, the company said without giving details.
    "The western Europe, North America and Far East regions
developed well in local currency, but here too the translation
of local currency sales into marks distorted the picture,
especially in the case of North America," it said.
    Bayer said parent company volume sales were also higher in
1986, although turnover fell 4.3 pct to 16.77 billion marks.
    Capacity use was high at the parent company in 1986,
resulting in a decline in marginal unit costs. This, combined
with savings in raw material and energy costs, helped offset
falling prices and cost increases in other areas.
    The rise in pre-tax parent company profit was due to lower
extraordinary expenses and higher net interest income.
Plastics, organic chemicals, polyurethanes and coating raw
materials all developed well, it said.
    Turning to the 1986 fourth quarter, Bayer said that world
group turnover fell to 9.67 billion marks in the last three
months of 1986 from 10.43 billion in the same 1985 period.
    Parent company turnover in the fourth quarter fell 7.1 pct
to 3.69 billion marks, with domestic turnover 4.1 pct lower and
foreign turnover 8.6 pct lower.
    Exports accounted for 65.3 pct of turnover in the quarter
against 66.4 pct in the same quarter of 1985.

not compensate the fall in revenues.

said it expects to report a loss for the fourth quarter ended
March 31 of about 20 cts per share, compared with a
year-earlier profit of 11 cts.
    The company blamed the expected loss on regulatory and
permitting issues that limited the full utilization of
hazardous waste treatment cites in Califoirnia, continued
startup delays for major remediation projects, the writeoff of
an investment in a subsidiary and a settlem,ent with the
California Attorney General's Office and Department of Health
Services.
    The company said the settlement relates to regulatory
violations alleged by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agengy
and the California Health Services department at the company's
Vine Hill and Panoche treatment facilities in Northern
California.
    It said under the agreement, it will pay the state
2,100,000 dlrs in civil penalties over a two-year period and
pay 500,000 dlrs over five years to local medical facilities as
part of a community awareness and emergency response program
developed by local communities.  The expenses will be charged
against fourth quarter results, it said.
    The company said it has agreed as well to make compliance
and public safety capital expenditures of about 600,000 dlrs.
    It said it has now received an operating permit for a new
250,000 cubic yard landfill cell at its Imperial County,
Calif., from the Health Services department.
    The company said the Panoche facility remains closed but is
expected to reopen for liquid and sludge receipts in the near
future.  But it said receipts of solid material, which had
accounted for the majority of the revenue at the site, could be
restricted until 1988 pending resolution of capacity issues in
the Panoche site permit.

<WELG.F> said its wholly-owned Luxembourg subsidiary WestLB
International SA posted a decline in 1986 net profit to 12.6
mln marks from 48.5 mln a year earlier.
    WestLB International will pay a 12.5 mln mark dividend to
WestLB, down from 47.7 mln a year earlier.
    The dividend was lower than in 1985 because the record
profit of the previous year could not be repeated, due to
changed market conditions, it said. Increased funds were also
allocated for provisions. Business in the first three months of
1987 developed positively, it added.
    WestLB International set aside 115.3 mln marks for
international credit risks in 1986, up from 97.4 mln marks in
1985, bringing the total amount of provisions shown in the
balance sheet to 580.3 mln marks.
    Operating profit fell to 122 mln marks in 1986 from 150 mln
in 1985. Balance sheet total fell to 9.7 billion marks from
10.8 billion, reflecting the lower dollar and the fact that
credit business redemptions were not fully offset by new
lending.
    The statement said WestLB International's business with
private customers showed a pleasing expansion last year.
    This development was aided by cooperation between the bank
and the savings banks in the West German state of North
Rhine-Westphalia, where parent bank WestLB is based.
    Deposits by non-banks rose more than 40 pct to a total of
1.1 billion.
    WestLB International said it plans to expand its range of

to report a loss for the first quarter in the range of 55 mln
to 65 mln dlrs or 2.13 to 2.15 dlrs a share.
    The company also said it intends to reduce its second
quarter common stock dividend to 35 cts a share from 69 cts.
    Mellon said it will make a provision for loan losses in the
first quarter of 175 mln dlrs, reflecting about 95 mln dlrs in
charge-offs and 80 mln dlrs in additions to the loan-loss
reserve.
    It will also put 310 mln dlrs in Brazilian loans on a cash
basis, resulting in interest reversals of 10 mln dlrs.
    In the first quarter of 1986, Mellon earned 60.4 mln dlrs
or 2.13 dlrs a share.
    Chairman David Barnes said the loan charge-offs and
increased provisions address four areas of concern in the
bank's wholesale lending portfolio - the energy sector,
developing countries, some basic industrial companies and
several commercial real estate businesses.
    Mellon said the loan loss reserve at the end of the first
quarter is estimated to be 575 mln dlrs, or about 2.5 pct of
the loan book, compared with 493.8 mln dlrs or 2.17 pct of
total loans at the end of 1986.
    Mellon said its primary capital ratio at the end of the
first quarter will be in line with the end-1986 figure of 7.23
pct, well in excess of regulatory guidelines.
    Non-performing loans at quarter-end are estimated at 1.45
billion dlrs, or 6.5 pct of the loan portfolio, compared with
928 mln dlrs or 3.94 pct at the end of 1986.
    Barnes noted that Mellon has a bigger involvement in
energy-based lending than many other banks. Because of the lack
of a substantial recovery in energy prices this year,
especially in natural gas prices, it was felt prudent to
increase reserves and take losses on loans in this sector.
    "This action relates both to loans to companies directly
involved in energy, as well as loans to real estate developers,
home builders and financial institutions in the Southwestern
United States," Barnes said.
    As for LDC loans, he said Mellon had removed about 80 mln
dlrs in fully current Argentine loans from cash basis but had
charged off about 20 mln dlrs in private-sector Mexican debt.
    He said Mellon, which was ordered in December to quit
Brazil because of its refusal to renew some short-term credit
lines, expects to participate in efforts to helpt Brazil and
other sovereign borrowers to reschedule their debts.
    Loans to basic industries were not major contributors to
the increase in non-performing assets or to first-quarter
charge offs, but Mellon said it remains concerned about the
absence of a strong recovery in steel and related industries.
    The increase in reserves, the dividend cut and continued
management cost-cutting are aimed at ensuring that Mellon has
the financial strength to deal with current uncertainties,
Barnes said.
    "We cannot predict when the uncertainties that presently
trouble us will end, but we are confident we are managing them
aggressively," he added.

    He told a news conference at the trade fair here that by
the mid-1990s turnover should reach between six and seven
billion marks, mainly through acquisitions totalling "several
hundred million marks."
    Kloeckner reported in March higher profits in its
engineering sector which enabled it to raise profits by nearly
a third in the 1985/86 year to 45.2 mln marks from 33.8 mln.

California Public Utilities Commission decision to reconsider
allowing only 20 mln dlrs of the 69 mln dlrs in San Onofre
nuclear station costs it disallowed makes it likely that

said its board declared a dividend of 15 cts per share on
common stock, its first dividend since it omitted payment in
February 1980 as a result of the Three Mile Island nuclear
accident in 1979.
    The company said it was able to declare the dividend due to
progress in the cleanup of Three Mile Island Unit Two.
    A company spokesman said GPU expects to continue declaring
dividends on a quarterly basis, with the rate depending on the
progress of the cleanup and on other company operations.
    GPU said the dividend is of "modest size," representing
less than a third of the amount paid as a dividend by the
average electric utility.
    "As the operating companies need to return to the capital
markets for debt and preferred stock, this should tend to
produce lower cost and better terms," the company said.
    The dividend is payable May 29 to holders of record April
24.

industry fears mounting risks will hurt earnings but hopes 1987
turnover will stabilize around 1986's 140 billion marks, Josef
Strenger, a board member of the industry association VCI, said.
    Strenger, management board chairman of Bayer AG <BAYG.F>,
told a news conference at the Hanover trade fair the main
dangers were stagnation in world trade, the lower dollar as
well as crude oil and commodity prices.
    Prospects of higher operating costs were also seen harming
earnings, he said. Turnover took a considerable downturn at the
start of 1987 after falling 5.9 pct in 1986.
    The chemical industry, which relies heavily on exports, was
badly hit by mark appreciation in 1986 and lower turnover was
mainly due to foreign exchange losses, Strenger said.
    Exports fell 6.4 pct to 72 billion marks in 1986 and
competition from U.S. And British firms increased. Savings from
lower oil and commodity prices were eaten up by price
competition and increased costs.
    Strenger said 1986 operating profits of German chemical
firms were slightly worse than the year before but the improved
financial and balance sheet structure, after three good years,
neutralized the negative impact.
    Strenger said the industry would try to increase production
in the U.S. To make up for lost export possibilities out of
West Germany.
    The lower dollar was the main reason for an 8.3 pct fall in
exports to North America, an 11.4 pct drop to Latin America and
22.6 pct plunge to the Middle East.
    Exports to Western Europe eased 3.5 pct and Far East
exports, due to an economic revival in Japan, dropped 5.2 pct.
    Strenger noted that the industry had lost public confidence
following several cases of chemical pollution of the Rhine late
last year.

 ]]></BODY><BODY><![CDATA[Dutch dairy and general foods
manufacturer Koninklijke Wessanen NV <WESS.AS>, said it is
planning further world-wide acquisitions and forsees strong
profit growth over the next 10 years.
     Company chairman Gerrit van Driel told journalists at the
presentation of Wessanen's 1986 report he already expected 1987
first quarter profits to show an increase.
    The company last month reported a 16 pct increase in 1986
net profits to 72.7 mln guilders, after 62.3 mln in 1985.
    This was achieved despite a 25 pct drop in the dollar's
guilder value, van Driel said.
    Van Driel said profits would have been nine mln guilders
higher if the US currency had remained at its average 1985
level of 3.20 guilders.
    Turnover, at 3.7 billion guilders in 1986, was 450 mln
guilders down because of the lower dollar and lower raw
material prices. Total 1985 turnover was 4.2 billion guilders.
    US activities accounted for 34 pct of 1986 turnover,
compared with 22 pct in 1982. Wessanen now has 15 separate
businesses in the US out of a total of 62 world-wide.
    Van Driel said the company would continue an active
takeover policy in the US, but would be wary about paying more
than its current price/earnings ratio of 17 times net profit.
    He added that Wessanen teams were seeking acquisition
possibilities in Brazil, Taiwan, Thailand and China.
    He said the company had an ample cashflow of 100 mln
guilders and would if necessary make new share issues.
    Van Driel said he expected a 1987 US turnover of 700 mln
dlrs. He said <Balanced Foods> and <Green's Dairy>, taken over
late last year, have a combined annual turnover of 126 mln dlrs
which was not included in the 1986 account.
    All sectors saw strong growth in 1986, resulting in a 13
pct increase in operating income to 120 mln guilders. Key to
this growth was the successful introduction of new products,
which were greatly enhanced by a number of consumer-oriented US
acquisitions, van Driel said.
    Consumer products represented 50 pct of total 1986
turnover, compared with 35 pct in 1982, van Driel said.
    The company, which is already listed on the London, Zurich,
Basle and Geneva stock exchanges as well as Amsterdam, aims to
be quoted in Frankfurt and Dusseldorf in May, van Driel said.
    Van Driel stressed that while these listings would not be
accompanied by new share issues, they provided easy vehicles
for the company to raise capital for future expansion.
    He estimated that 33 pct of the company's shares were in
foreign hands.
    The company's 1986 US turnover of about 750 mln dlrs made a
listing on one of the New York exchanges a logical next step,
van Driel said without elaborating.
    Despite EC dairy restrictions Wessanen, which produces
around 10 pct of all Dutch cheese, saw good growth prospects
for its dairy sector within Europe, van Driel said.

Thayer Bigelow, told security analysts the company is
"comfortable" with Wall Street estimates that 1987 earnings
will be in a range of 3.75 dlrs to 4.25 dlrs per share.
    In 1986, Time reported earnings of 5.95 dlrs per share,
including a number of special items.
    Bigelow said in adjusting the 1986 results for the special
items and also removing the earnings of American Television and
Communications Corp <ATCMA>, Time earned 2.35 dlrs per share in
1986.
    Turner Broadcasting System Inc said the investment by the
cable consortium would be in Turner Broadcasting, not directly
in CNN. The consortium would infuse up to 550 mln dlrs in
Turner Broadcasting in return for a 35 pct equity interest.
    Ted Turner, Chairman, would retain a 51 pct interest, a
Turner Broadcasting spokesman said.
    Bigelow said the company is continuing its previously
announced 10 mln share repurchase program and has bought back
4.1 mln of its own shares. He said 700,000 shares were
purchased in the first quarter of 1987 at an average price of
81 dlrs per share.
    Bigelow said the company will always have a share buyback
program in place whenever it believes it is a better long-term
investment than starting or acquring a business. But he did not
give any specifics on further repurchases beyond the 10 mln
shares already announced.
   
    On the subject of acquisitions, Richard Munro, chairman and
chief executive said the company is not interested in investing
in over-the-air broadcasting, but continues to look at all
areas in which it is currently engaged.
    Munro said book publishing is an area that interested Time.
In 1986 the company purchased Scott and Foresman, its biggest
acquisition ever.
    N.J. Nicholas, president and chief operating officer, said
the company might be interested in a relatively small book
business.
    He said following the recent agreement for the sale of
Harper and Row to the News Corp Ltd <NWS>, "there may be pieces
that Murdoch doesn't want," referring to News Corp chairman
Rupert Murdoch.
    Asked if the company's SAMI business is for sale, Munro
said it is a "delicate subject", and "we're looking at all the
options." SAMI is a marketing information service for the food
industry. Published reports have stated it could be worth as
much as 500 mln dlrs.
   
    Bigelow said that Time's Home Box Office added  subscribers
last year and the trend is continuing in the first quarter of
1987. However, he said, HBO's results in the quarter will be
down slightly, but in the first quarter of 1986 there was a
special gain in the HBO unit.
    Nicholas said that HBO and Cinemax had combined subscriber
growth of 800,000 for last year.
    He also said the tax rate in 1987 will remain at just under
50 pct because of the repeal of investment tax credits and
higher state and local taxes. He said he sees a decrease in the
tax rate in 1988 of five or six percentage points.
    Munro said the company does not plan to increase its
dividend.
    Trygve Myhren, chairman and chief executive of American
Television and Communications, said the unit is looking at
getting involved in the home shopping video area. "It would be
foolish not to be a player there," he said.
    He said the company had talks with Home Shopping Network
Inc <HSN> prior to that company's public offering last year,
but nothing came of the talks.

about 17 cts a share for the full year in 1987.
    For the first quarter the acquisition will have a negative

Thayer Bigelow told security analysts.
    He said Scott, Foresman, a textbook publisher, will
contribute more than 50 mln dlrs in operating income before
depreciation and amortization for the full year.
    N.J. Nicholas, president and chief operating officer, said
Soctt Foresman will have over 200 mln dlrs in revenue in 1987.

highest profit in the third quarter and incurs a loss in the
first quarter, will have an "adverse impact of 15 mln dlrs' on
book publishing income for the first quarter.
    "First quarter performance for the rest of Time Inc will be

its condition has "significantly deteriorated" and that its
operating cash reserves will be inadequate by May 1987 unless
it receives additional financing or rate relief from state
public utilities commissions in Texas and Louisiana.
    In the company's newly-released annual report and 10-K
filing, Gulf States said its bank lenders had notified the
utility last month that no additional credit would be granted.
Gulf States said the banks had requested the utility to begin
making prepayments by the end of April of 45 mln dlrs more than
the estimated 1987 lease payments of 40 mln dlrs.
    "The circumstances increase the likelihood that the company
may have to seek protection from its creditors under the
bankruptcy code," Gulf States said.
    The utility had previously said it might be forced to
consider filing for bankruptcy because of limited rate
increases granted by state regulators in connection with Gulf
States' 4.3 billion dlr River Bend nuclear plant in Louisiana.
    "If the regulatory commissions approve the company's
proposed rate moderation plan and grant the increases provided
for in such plan during the initial three-year phase-in period,
the company believes it could achieve financial stability,"
Gulf States said.
    In February, the Texas Public Utilities Commission granted
Gulf States an interim rate increase of 39.9 mln dlrs
contingent upon the utility obtaining a new 250 mln dlr line of
credit to pay operating expenses. The utility had sought 144.1
mln dlrs in rate hikes in Texas.
    Gulf States has appealed a decision by Louisiana state
regulators rejecting its application for 100 mln dlrs in
emergency rate relief.
    In 1986, Gulf States earned 244.9 mln dlrs on revenues of
1.47 billion dlrs, compared to profits of 265.4 mln dlrs on
sales of 1.85 billion in the previous year.

directors unanimously approved a recapitalization plan under
which stockholders will get a cash distribution of 25 dlrs per
share via a one-time special cash dividend and will retain
their common stock ownership in Caesars World.
    Caesars World said it expects to raise the approximately
one billion dlrs needed to pay the 25 dlr per share dividend
and the expenses of recapitalization through around 200 mln
dlrs in bank borrowings and a public sale of approximately 800
mln dlrs of debt. Some outstanding debt will be retired.
    Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc, Caesars' financial advisor, has
told the company it is confident it can arrange the entire
financing needed for the recapitalization.
    Henry Gluck, chairman and chief executive officer of the
hotel, casino and resorts company, said in a statement the
board believes the recapitalization plan is financially
superior to a 28 dlr a share tender offer by Martin Sosnoff.
    Gluck said the Caesars World board once again recommends
that shareholders reject the Sosnoff offer.
    The stock closed at 29.25 dlrs a share on Friday.
    "Our ability to restructure along these lines is possible
primarily because of the financial stability and the strong
operating results achieved by management in recent years," Gluck
said.
    He said that after the recapitalization takes effect,
proforma net income for the fiscal year ended July 31, 1988 is
expected to be about 28.7 mln dlrs.
    Fiscal 1988 primary earnings per share are projected to be
76 cents, based on about 37.8 mln in post-recapitalization
common and common-equivalent shares outstanding.
    Commenting on the company's longer term earnings outlook,
Gluck said "we project net income to increase to 86.2 mln dlrs
in 1992, reflecting increased operating income and lower
interest expense due to the retirement of 267 mln dlrs of debt
incurred in connection with the recapitalization."
    He said the company does not usually release projections,
but has done so now beause of the significance of the
recapitalization.
    Gluck said the recapitalization plan will be submitted for
stockholder approval at a special meeting expected in June.
    The plan will require the approval of stockholders and that
of the Nevada and New Jersey gaming regulatory authorities.
    As part of the plan, the company will change its state of
incorporation from Florida to Delaware by means of a merger of
Caesars World into a wholly owned subsidiary of the company.
    The new incorporation certificate and bylaws will provide
for, among other things, a "fair price" provision requiring that
certain transactions with interested 15 pct stockholders be
approved by an 80 pct vote of stockholders, excluding shares
held by such interested stockholders.
    Caesars World said in a statement that "the cash
distribution will result in a substantial deficit in
stockholders' equity." It did not give an estimate of the size
of this deficit.
    But the company said its financial advisors have said they
believe that after the recapitalization, Caesars World should
have the financial flexibility and resources necessary to
finance its current and projected operating and capital
requirements.

sharply today after the company presented a bullish earnings
scenario at a meeting for pharmaceutical analysts Monday,
traders and analysts said.
    The company said it expects earnings for fiscal 1987,
ending June 30, to rise more than 75 pct over a year ago.
    That pronouncement encouraged analyst David Crossen of
Sanford C. Bernstein and Co to raise his earnings estimates for
the company to 1.28 dlrs a share in 1987, compared to his
previous estimate of 1.20 dlrs a share. Last year the company
earned 70 cts a share.
    Marion's stock gained 3-1/4 to 75-1/2.
    At the meeting of pharmaceutical analysts, Marion's
president Fred Lyons Jr. said Wall Street eanrings estimates of
1.10-1.15 dlrs a share for fiscal 1987 "are expected to cause
even the aggressive side of this range to be 10 to 15 cts low."
    Lyons said the strong performance in the second half of
this year will result from the fourth quarter introduction of
90 mg and 120 mg Cardizem tablets. Analyst Crossen said that
Cardizem, which treats angina, is also expected to be approved
for the treatment of hypertension by the end of the year.
    Crossen said "because Marion is still just a small company,
the growth of Cardizem is having a big impact on the bottom
line." He raised fiscal 1988 earnings estimates to 2.15 dlrs a
share from his previous estimate of 2.05 dlrs a share.
    "The company has a broad new product pipeline in the
industry and as far as I am concerned, it is the most
innovative company in the business," he said.
    For the five years through 1991, Crossen expects Marion to
have a growth rate of 55 pct.

Plc> launches its prospectus for privatisation tomorrow with
many analysts forecasting higher profits this year. But it is
likely to miss contracts to power the proposed <Airbus
Industrie> A340 aircraft.
    The company's so-called "pathfinder prospectus" gives all the
details of its stock market flotation except for the price at
which shares will be offered.
    Last month, the company announced that pretax profits rose
in 1986 to 120 mln stg from 81 mln the year before.
    Brokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd, BZW, sees 155 mln profit
for 1987.
    Analyst Tim Harris of Phillips and Drew said rising profits
and a low tax charge would be offset by the fact that Rolls
operated in a sector which traditionally attracted low ratings.
    Assuming the company was valued at around eight times
earnings, this would give a selling price valuing it at about
1.2 billion, though he said the recent good performance of the
aerospace sector could nudge this figure upwards.
    BZW is currently forecasting a higher sale price at between
1.5 billion and 1.7 billion.
    The price will be increased by it being likely to have much
of its debt wiped off by a government anxious to assure the
company's health when it has to fend for itself. Rolls was
rescued from bankruptcy and taken into state ownership in 1971.
    When the government announced the sale, it said it would
inject permanent capital equivalent to net debt -- around 250
mln stg at end-1986 -- into the company.
    Analysts noted this was necessary to ensure Rolls a credit
rating to match those of its main competitors such as General
Electric Co <GE.N> and United Technologies Corp's <UTX.N> Pratt
and Whitney unit.

expects improvement in the pulp and paper sector shown in the
second half of 1986 to continue this year. The continued
improvement would be due to good market demand, better product
prices and high operating capacity, the company said in its
annual report.
    Consolidated-Bathurst, which reported operating profit of
104 mln dlrs last year on sales of 2.02 billion dlrs, said its
joint-venture acquisition of a market pulp mill at Castlegar,
B.C. last year broadens its product range and will contribute
to equity earnings.
    Last year's results were up from 1985 operating profit of
80 mln dlrs and sales of 1.73 billion dlrs.
    The company said it views its near-term prospects with
improved optimism.
    It said results from its Bridgewater newsprint mill in the
U.K. should improve greatly this year due to stronger capacity
and production and more favorable market conditions.
    It said it anticipates a return to profitability in 1987
for its Diamond-Bathurst Inc (DBH) subsidiary, which lost 6.2
mln U.S. dlrs and underwent a reorganization last year, and
expects higher sales and earnings for its other North American
packaging divisions.
    Consolidated-Bathurst said the outlook for its Europa
Carton unit is mixed. It said the effect of trade disputes
between the United States and the European Economic Community
on the West German economy and the higher value of the mark may
lead to increased costs which could not be offset by price
increases.

fully diluted basis. In the year-ago first quarter the company
earned 23.1 mln dlrs or 75 cts a share.
    The company also said its first quarter results are
expected to include a provision for loan losses of 55 mln dlrs,
about 20 mln dlrs over net loan-charge-offs of about 35 mln

328 mln dlrs or 2.2 pct of loans.
    RepublicBank, with total assets of about 21 billion dlrs,
announced in December an agreement with InterFirst Corp <IFC>

subsidiary of the U.S.-based bank, said it made a net loss of
just over six mln crowns in 1986 -- although foreign bankers
said they expect it to show 1987 profits after two lean years.
    Citibank's Oslo treasury head Bjoern Sejerstad told
Reuters, Citibank, one of seven foreign bank subsidiaries
operating in Norway, lost money because of restructuring for
investment banking away from commercial banking and an economic
slump in Norway following last year's plunge in oil prices.
    Foreign banks have been allowed to operate susbidiaries in
Norway since 1985.
    Foreign banking analysts in Oslo said access to Norway's
second-hand securities and equities markets, to be approved
later this spring, and lower primary reserve requirements would
make profit this year.
    Citibank lost 490,000 crowns in Norway in 1985, but
Sejerstad said a profit was likely this year because of planned
liberalisation and better economic performance, helped by a
steadier oil price of around 18 dlrs a barrel.
    Earlier this year, Chase Manhattan Bank's <CMB.N>
subsidiary decided to stop foreign exchange trading after heavy
losses and focus instead on fee-based merchant banking.

    A statement said the firm expects to pay total dividends
for 1987 of not less than 40 cents a share on the expanded

    Jardine Matheson decided to withdraw its issue because of a
joint announcement earlier today by Ronald Li, chairman of the

Astin, that the listings of new "B" shares would be barred.
    The official announcement said this will include the
proposal by Jardine Matheson.
    But the Jardine statement quoted chairman Simon Keswick as
saying: "We continue to believe that the issuing of "B" shares
would benefit shareholders, and regret that they will not be
given the opportunity to vote on the matter at this stage."
    Keswick said the "B" share issue will benefit Jardine
Matheson's shareholders by giving the firm flexibility to issue
ordinary shares for expansion in future without diluting
existing shareholders' voting rights.
    However, he added: "We certainly welcome (the Secretary for

placed its approximately 540 mln dlrs of medium- and long-term
loans to Brazil on non-accrual status and that first-quarter
net income will be reduced by about seven mln dlrs as a result.
    Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlrs
of medium- and long-term debt on February 22.
    U.S. banking regulations do not require banks to stop
accruing interest on loans until payments are 90 days overdue,
but Bankers Trust said it acted now because of "the high
potential of a continued suspension that would result in
reaching the 90-day limit in the second quarter of 1987."
    Assuming no cash payments at current interest rates are
received for the rest of 1987, Bankers Trust estimated that
full-year net income would be reduced by about 30 mln dlrs.
    Bankers Trust said it assumes that debt negotiations
between Brazil and its commercial bank lenders will lead to the
resumption of interest payments.
    The negotiations resume in New York on Friday when central
bank governor Francisco Gros is expected to ask banks for a
90-day rollover of some 9.5 billion dlrs of term debt that
matures on April 15.

    Continental said the initial payout was subject to Canadian
government approval.
    The bank reiterated that total distributions to common
shareholders would range from 16.50 dlrs a share to 17.25 dlrs
including the initial stock dividend and a final distribution
in late 1988 or early 1989.
    The payout of existing preferred shareholders will be
completed just before next month's initial distribution to

first-quarter earnings fell by 3.2 pct, largely reflecting its
previously announced decision to place on non-accrual status
its 1.3 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to Brazil.
    That decision, spurred by Brazil's suspension of interest
payments on February 20, reduced the quarter's net income by 20
mln dlrs to 226.4 mln dlrs, compared with 233.9 mln in the
first three months of 1986.
    Morgan also reported a loss of 1.8 mln dlrs from securities
underwriting and trading, in contrast to a gain of 45.4 mln
dlrs in the year-earlier period.
    In the fourth quarter of 1986, Morgan posted other trading
losses of 5.5 mln dlrs because of setbacks in the trading and
underwriting of Euromarket securities.
    Conditions in some sectors of the Euromarket remained
difficult last quarter, with floating rate notes suffering
heavy price falls, but a spokeswoman was unable to say whether
Morgan's trading losses were restricted to the Euromarket.
    On the positive side, Morgan reduced its provision for loan
losses to 35 mln dlrs from 70 mln a year earlier. Foreign
exchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln and
trust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln.
    Morgan said other operating income, mainly fees and
commissions, rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln, but net
investment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln.
    Net interest earnings were 490.4 mln dlrs in the first
quarter, down from 499.4 mln a year earlier, and net yield fell
to 2.79 pct from 3.20 pct.
    If Brazil had not been placed on non-accrual, which means
that interest can be recorded as income only when payments are
actually received, net interest earnings would have been 525.9
mln dlrs and net yield 2.99 pct. If Brazil does not resume
payments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, Morgan added.
    After the provision for loan losses, Morgan's allowance for
credit losses at the end of March totaled 953 mln dlrs compared
with 910 mln at end-1986 and 815 mln a year earlier.
    It reported net recoveries of six mln dlrs after
charge-offs of eight mln, compared with net charge-offs of 49
mln dlrs after recoveries of three mln a year earlier.
    Excluding Brazil, non-accruing loans at quarter's end were
583 mln dlrs, down from 633 mln at end-1986 and 684 mln a year
earlier. Non-interest expenses rose to 371.1 mln dlrs from
303.5 mln dlrs, with more than half the increase related to
personnel costs, Morgan said.

authorities should abolish their restrictions on full and free

Christopher Hogg said.
    In the 1986 annual repoprt, he said lengthy negotiations
had brought agreement with the Tokyo and London Stock Exchanges
for fuller, but still not complete, access to market data
through Reuter services.
    "Many other markets maintain restrictions," he added.
    Hogg said members of some markets appear to believe that
information restrictions protected their interests.
    In other cases, exchanges seem to be limiting the
distribution of data in order to provide competitive advantage
to their own commercial information businesses.
    He also noted that despite increasing liberalisation in the
telecommunications field, some countries continue to protect
their state monopolies at the expense of other economic
sectors.
    "Reuter dealing services remain excluded from such
countries. As a result, banking communities serving entire
economies are put at a competitive disadvantage," he added.

consolidated profit for its Agrimont Group, formed in June
1986, totalled 1.5 billion lire in 1986.
    Agrimont SPA, the holding company for Montedison's
Agro-Industrial businesses, had sales of 810 billion lire and a
net profit of about 1.1 billion lire, after amortization costs
of 35 billion lire and a 13 billion lire reduction in the value
of inventory due to falling market prices, Montedison said.
    Agrimont, still wholly owned by Montedison, is taking steps
to be traded on the Milan exchange, the company said.
    The company said that 1986 was characterized by an unstable
fertlizer market due to the weak dollar and the decline of
international prices for products sold in Europe and the U.S
where Agrimont operates through its Conserv division.
    In pesticides and in animal health care products Agrimont
maintained its previous level of revenues and market share in
1986, Montedison said.
    Montedison said it named Ettore dell'Isola to the newly
created position of president of Agrimont.
    Montedison also said it named Renato Picco, managing

to maintain for a number of years a similar earnings growth to
the 7.5 pct increase in net profit achieved in 1986, despite
continuing investments in a reorganization program and efforts
to extend world penetration.
    Heineken last month reported a 1986 net profit of 285 mln
guilders, after 265 mln in 1985.
    Chairman Freddie Heineken said the company, Europe's
leading beer producer with six pct of market share in 1986,
said sales increased by 6.3 pct to 42.1 mln hectoliters.
    The volume increase was due mainly to a rise in the U.S.,
Where the brand Amstel Lite saw great demand, and in Europe,
where sales accounted for 25.5 pct of the total.
    Turnover, despite losses in guilder terms due to weaker
foreign currencies, rose by 4.4 pct, to 6.7 billion guilders.
    Further consolidation of foreign companies, including the
increase of its stake in leading Spanish brewery <El Aguila
S.A.> to 51.2 pct, new ventures and modernization, particularly
in French and Spanish interests, eroded profit margins. The
company still planned to invest 700 mln guilders this year in
restructuring and marketing, Heineken said.
    Heineken's Spanish activities should start yielding profit
next year, Heineken said, adding that its French operations had
already turned to profit after vast rationalization last year.
    Vice Chairman Gerard van Schaik said the decision by the
European Court of Justice in Luxembourg to allow foreign beer
into the closed West German market -- Europe's biggest beer
market -- offered interesting possibilities for Heineken. "We
have the beer, but distribution and sales is the important
point," van Schaik said, adding that since the ruling Heineken
had been inundated by German traders seeking joint ventures.
    "The question is not if we want to penetrate the German
market, but how we are to do it," van Schaik said, adding that
while the widely traveled Germans seemed to be developing a
taste for foreign beer, the internal structure was very
regionalized.
     Heineken board member Hans Coebergh, responsible for
African operations, said he saw Africa as one of the most
important beer growth markets in the long term.
     He said the company, present in Africa since 1932 and with
majority stakes in six breweries and interests in 25, was
hampered by the lack of hard currencies there.
    Africa, where beer consumption averages only nine liters
per head per year and sales are limited by import restrictions
and currency risks, nonetheless accounted for 6.5 pct of total
1986 sales.
    On-site production is rendered expensive by the high price
of imports of essential ingredients. But Heineken scientists
have been looking at other possibilities.
    To balance the costs of imported malt, Heinken launched on
the Nigerian market a new beer made of 50 pct sorghum, which
had sold successfully, Coebergh said.
    Heineken is urging farmers to grow the traditional raw
materials, but Coebergh noted that banana and palm beer were
popular in Rwanda . "This is a possibility, but we could not
possibly achieve the Heineken flavor," Coebergh said.
    Chairman Heineken said the company's seven year efforts to
penetrate the Soviet market had finally resulted this week in a
contract that relaxed some of the restrictions they faced.
    But again, a lack of hard currencies limited Heineken's
market potential. Heineken now has seven bars in Moscow that
are enjoying good sales, but the bars only accept western
money.

    At an analysts meeting here the company said that for the
year ending April 30, 1987 it will earn about 73 mln dlrs, or
about 5.15-5.35 dlrs a share on sales of about 500 mln dlrs.
    In the year ago period, the company earned 53.4 mln dlrs,
or 3.65 dlrs a share, on sales of 402.8 mln dlrs.
    Winston Wallin, Medtronic chairman, said the company will
improve market share in fiscal 1988 in cardiac pacemakers and
expand its cardiovascular therapeutic product line.
    Wallin cautioned analysts not to quickly change their per
share estimates for the company as he said Medtronic will have
heavy sales and marketing expenses in fiscal 1988.
    He said the company intends to reinvest its earnings in its
businesses and not in its dividends. "Shareholders are better
off if we grow the business rather than reinvest in dividends
or share repurchases," he said.
    Wallin said he sees Medtronic's share of the total
worldwide pacemaker market increasing to 42 pct in fiscal 1988,
from 40 pct in fiscal 1987.
    He said the worldwide market for cardiovascualr therapeutic
products, which includes pacemakers, valves, catheters and
lasers, will be valued at about 2.5 billion dlrs 1990 and will
double that by 1995.
    Wallin said, "Our objective is to get a hold of new
products and start building market share if we have to beg,
borrow or steal to get into new markets."
    In the past, Medtronic's pacemakers have been plagued with
a number of problems leading to product recalls. Regulators
also have criticized the industry, citing quality problems and
a needless overprescription of pacemakers.
    "We have no knowledge of any major problems in our
pacemakers or leads," Wallin said. "We intend to re-establish
our company as the quality leader in the industry."
    Glen Nelson, executive vice president for Medtronics, said
the company intends to diversify internally and through
acquisitions of companies in areas of Medtronic's expertise,
such as drug delivery systems.
    Wallin said the 15 pct earnings growth for fiscal 1988 does
not include dilutions from acquisitions. "We hope to have some
safety provisions so that we won't have any major dilutions
from an acquisition."
    Wallin also said the company will have virtual exclusivity
in rate responsive pacemakers for all of fiscal 1988.
    The company markets Activitrax, the first single chamber
pacemaker that varies heartrate in response to physical
activity.
    Siemens AG, a West German company, is also developing a
rate responsive pacemaker.

charge of 19 to 20 mln dlrs pretax against results for the
third quarter ended March 31, director and assistant to the
president J. Kell Houssels III told Reuters.
    He said the charge results from pre-operating expenses of
its recently-opened Atlantic City, N.J., Showboat Hotel, Casino
and Bowling Center and will cause a loss for the third quarter
and probably for all of fiscal 1987 as well.
    But Houssels said Showboat's earnings for fiscal 1988
should show a sharp increase from fiscal 1986 levels due to the
contribution of the new Atlantic City facility.
    Showboat earned 1,753,000 dlrs in last year's third
quarter.  For all of fiscal 1986 it earned 5,769,000 dlrs.
    Houssels said Showboat since the opening of the Atlantic
City hotel/casino, Showboat has had to start charging interest
expenses connected with debt it sold to finance the facility
directly against income rather than capitalizing the interest
as it had been able to do previously.
    Showboat opened the hotel during its third quarter and
gaming began last Thursday on a regular basis after test gaming
was completed earlier in the week.

placing medium and long-term loans to Brazil and Ecuador on a
non-accrual basis as of March 31, a move that will reduce first
quarter earnings by 7.2 mln dlrs, or nine cts per share, after
taxes.
    Despite the anticipated reduction to quarterly earnings,
Security Pacific said it still expects to report first quarter
earnings higher than the 88 mln dlrs, or 1.11 dlrs per share
reported for the first quarter of 1986.
    The bank holding company said the action affects 401 mln
dlrs of loans to Brazil and 73 mln of loans to Ecuador.
    Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlrs
of medium- and long-term debt on February 20.
    Ecuador, which has foreign debt of roughly eight billion
dlrs, has not paid any interest to foreign banks since
February.
    In March Ecuador said it would suspend interest payments
for the rest of the year because of an earthquake which halted
the export of oil, which accounts for about 75 pct the
country's export revenues.
    In its announcement, Security Pacific said it will record
interest income only as it is received in cash.
    The company also said it believes that Brazil will reach an
agreement with its banks and that interest payments will resume
later in 1987.
    The Brazilian negotiations resume on Friday in New York
when Central Bank Governor Francisco Gros is expected to ask
banks for a 90-day roll-over of some 9.5 billion dlrs of term
debt that matures on April 15.

    Meinert reiterated an earlier comment that earnings for the
remainder of the year must double the 1986 level to meet that
goal. In fiscal 1986, ended November 30, 1986, Hartmarx
reported earnings of 24.8 mln dlrs, or 1.20 dlrs a share, down
from the prior year's 42.7 mln dlrs, or 2.25 dlrs a share.
    The 110-year-old apparel manufacturer recently posted
first-quarter earnings of 54 cts a share, up from 40 cts a year
ago.
    Meinert told shareholders Hartmarx has no plans to sell any
of its divisions. He added, "We have the financial capacity to
take advantage of acquisitions."
    In 1987, Meinert said the company will open five new and 10

Detroit, St. Louis, Washington, D.C. and San Francisco.
    He said the company's women's apparel continues to grow,

first quarter results were significantly higher due to the
strong results of RCA, which was acquired last year.
    General Electric also attibuted continued strong
performances in plastics, major appliances and the Employers
Reinsurance Corp for its strong quarter.
    GE recorded net earnings for the first quarter 1987 of 624
mln dlrs, or 1.37 dls per shr, up 16 pct from 537 mln dlrs, or
1.18 dlrs per share for the same quarter a year ago.
    General Electric chairman John Welch Jr reiterated the
company's outlook for 1987 in which it expects double-digit GE
earnings growth for the year. He said the first quarter results
are in line with those expectations.
    General Electric cited the strong results in TV network and
station operations of the National Broadcasting Co, which was
not part of GE in the first quarter of 1986, as one reason for
its strong earnings.
    It also noted that aircraft engine operating profit was
much higher than a year ago, caused by a increase in shipments
than the 1986 quarter, which was impacted by a strike.
    Aerospace revenues were sharply higher in this year's first
quarter from a year ago, mainly because of the inclusion of
RCA's aerospace and defense business, the company said.
    In addition, consumer products revenues were up from last
year, mainly because of including sales of RCA video products.
    General Electric said restructuring provisions of 308 mln
dlrs before taxes to implement various strategic moves were
charged against operations in the first quarter of 1987. It
added that there was a one-time gain of 281 mlns dlrs after
taxes from an inventory accounting change.
    And technical products revenues and operating profit were
ahead of last year, led by a strong increases in medical
systems volume and the inclusion this year of RCA's

fertilizer transportation volumes to be flat in 1987 but said
operating profits from the pipeline unit should improve from
49.4 mln dlrs earned last year when a seven mln dlr special
charge was incurred.
    Williams Pipeline Co took the charge against earnings in
1986 for the removal of more than 500 miles of old pipeline
from service and for casualty losses. Companywide, Williams had
a net loss of 134 mln dlrs on total revenues of 1.85 billion
dlrs, a decline from profits of 32 mln dlrs on sales of 2.46
billion in 1985.
    In its annual report, Williams said its Northwest Pipeline
Corp and Williams Natural Gas Co had natural gas costs that are
among the lowest in the nation, averaging 2.04 dlrs and 2.07
dlrs per mcf, respectively, last year. Total natural gas
reserves for both units declined to 10,010 billion cubic feet
in 1986 from 11,334 billion cubic feet the previous year.
    The company said its Williams Natural Gas unit, which has
less take-or-pay exposure than most major pipelines, should
show improvement in its 1987 operating results because of
changes tariff and federal tax rates.
    The company's gas marketing business is expected to have
somewhat lower earnings in 1987 because of competition in its
operating region, the annual report said. The gas marketing
unit earned 26.0 mln dlrs on sales of 285.6 mln dlrs last year.
    Williams also said it expected a substantial decline in its
debt to equity ratio this year because of more than 250 mln
dlrs received in cash from the sale of Agrico Chemical Co and
proceeds from the sale and leaseback of Williams
Telecommunications Co. The telecommunications business, a
2,000-mile fiber optic system for long distance use, will not
be profitable until late 1988, Williams said.

the annual report.
    "...there are conditions which may indicate that the
company will be unable to continue as a going concern,"
auditors Deloitte Haskins and Sells said in Hawkeye's annual
report to shareholders.
    Hawkeye reported a 1986 loss of almost 59 mln dlrs, citing
an increase in its loan loss provision to 34.7 mln dlrs and
restructuring costs of 27 mln dlrs.
    However, Hawkeye, with assets of 1.09 billion dlrs at 1986
year end, said it expects "to have sufficient cash to meet its
obligations for the next 12-month period."
    Last July the bank holding company reached a debt
restructuring agreement which identifed 17 bank subsidiaries
and five non-bank operations for disposition.
    "The restructuring has improved Hawkeye's financial
condition, but it does not assure that Hawkeye will be able to
survive as a going concern," the report said.
    Hawkeye's survival will depend on its ability to comply
with provisions of the debt restructuring and regulatory
agreements and on its ability to return to profitable
operations, it said.
    There can be no assurance that Hawkeye will be able to meet
these requirements. However, the company "believes it will be

said the predicted rise in industrial production in the U.S.
And Europe should boost its 1987 performance.
    Consumption of some base metals and their dlr prices are
showing signs of improvement, although iron ore markets have
weakened. The oil price in U.S. Dlrs is above the 1986 average,
and if sustained, should improve energy earnings.
    The company was commenting in a statement on its 1986
results which, on a restated basis, showed net attributable
profits lower at 245 mln stg after 257 mln the previous year.
Pretax profits also dipped to 601.7 mln stg after 614.4 mln.
    RTZ said the excellent performance of its expanding range
of industrial businesses in 1986 was offset by the collapse in
oil prices.
    Industrial businesses contributed 202 mln stg to net
profit, a 40 pct increase from 144 mln in 1985, and 60 pct of
the total. Trading performance improved at wholly-owned
subsidiaries RTZ Borax Ltd, RTZ Cement Ltd, RTZ Chemicals Ltd
and RTZ Pillar Ltd. First time contributions from recent
investment and acquisitions mainly in speciality chemicals and
minerals also aided performance.
    Metals activities contributed 83 mln stg to net profit.

<PLDT.MN> is planning a two-for-one stock split and a 20 pct
stock dividend later this year to reduce excess market
buoyancy, Vice-President Sennen Lazo told Reuters.
    Lazo said the stock split would reduce the par value of the
company's common stock from 10 to five pesos.
    He said the stock split would apply to holders of about 18
mln common shares of stock on the record date of September 15
1987. "The exercise should make our stock more marketable," Lazo
said. "Now it is beyond the reach of many small investors."
    PLDT common stock surged from a low of 37 pesos in February
1986 to 367.50 at close of trading yesterday on the Manila
Stock Exchange.
    Lazo said the 20 pct stock dividend, payable on October 15,
would also apply to stockholders on record as of September 15.
    PLDT reported 1986 net income of 1.89 billion pesos, up 68
pct from 778.9 mln pesos in 1985, on operating revenues of six
billion pesos, up from 4.7 billion pesos in 1985.
    At end December 1986 the company had 417,100 stockholders.
    A PLDT spokesman said the company's profits are likely to
be substantial since the government raised its franchise tax to
three pct from two and to impose a 35 pct corporate income tax
from which it was previously exempt.
    The government has not so far ordered the implementation of
the tax decision.
    PLDT is the largest of 58 telephone companies in the
Philippines. On December 31 1986 the company had 856,014
telephones in operation, representing 94 pct of all instruments
in the country.

reported a parent company net profit up 34.8 pct to 140.1 mln
francs from 103.9 mln francs a few weeks before its
denationalisation around the end of this month.
    Official sources said the bank, France's sixth largest in
terms of its deposits and seventh in terms of its assets,

planned a share split to increase the number of shares on offer
ahead of the sale of 40 pct of its ordinary share capital to
the public, of 10 pct to staff and 20 pct abroad.
    Previously one of France's biggest private banks, it was
nationalised by the Socialists in 1982.
    The sources said it was too early to give details of the
planned split or of the share price, but cited April 27 as a
likely date for the flotation launch.
    So far 30 pct of the group's capital, currently at 10.33
mln shares of 100 francs nominal, has been offered for sale to
large private investors to constitute a solid core of eight to
ten shareholders before the flotation.
    The private tender offer closes on April 16, while a 12 mln
franc advertising campaign for the flotation begins on Sunday.
"The privatisation will be a way of attracting extra clients,"
CCF deputy director-general Rene de la Serre told Reuters.
    Market sources put the total value of CCF's privatisation
at between four and five billion francs.
    De la Serre said the bank was likely to attract at least
the same number of investors as <Sogenal>, another recently
privatised bank in which 850,000 people bought shares.
    The government's sweeping privatisation programme has also
included the sale of Saint-Gobain <SGEP.PA>, and Cie Financiere
de Paribas <PARI.PA>. The sale of <Banque du Batiment et des
Travaux Publics> and <Banque Industrielle et Mobiliere Privee>
should be completed this month, while third largest French bank
Societe Generale <SGEN.PA> will be privatised later this year.

 ]]></BODY><BODY><![CDATA[Dutch insurer AEGON NV <AEGN.AS>
reported a 6.4 pct increase in 1986 net profits to 327.1 mln
guilders and said it expected a moderate increase in profits
for 1987.
    Total revenue was eight pct lower in 1986 at 7.97 billion
guilders vs 8.7 billion guilders in 1985. The company said its
revenues were down due to lower foreign exchange rates and a
change in accounting practice. It added that revenues would
have risen by about seven pct had those changes not occurred.
    Revenue from Dutch operations rose five pct in 1986, mainly
due to its life insurance business.
    Health insurance revenues in the Netherlands also rose
despite a notable shift to insurances with lower premiums and
higher personal risks.
    Damage insurances made losses, mainly due to car damage
insurances. AEGON did not specify the loss.
    In the United States, revenue in guilders from health and
life insurance was lower. AEGON said this was due to a change
in accounting for U.S. Annuities.
    AEGON said annuities are subject to such strong personal
investment influences that it should be accounted differently
from the more traditional insurances.
    This change in accounting practice and another change to
account for profits made on fixed interest investments,
resulted in an incidental rise in net profits of 31 mln
guilders.
    AEGON said incidental negative influences on net profits
were slightly higher, being the lower dollar rate, high initial
costs for new products, and the cost of new headquarters in The
Hague.
    In 1986, a large number of new insurance products emerged
in the Netherlands and the U.S., AEGON said. Large initial
costs for these products have depressed net profits somewhat.
    Monumental Corp, a U.S. Insurer which merged with AEGON in
May 1986, saw its profits almost completely eroded by these
costs and made only a small contribution to the group's
profits.
    AEGON said it has written-off 657 mln guilders in goodwill
for Monumental Corp.
    AEGON's net equity was 2.71 billion guilders in December
1986, against 3.46 billion the year before.

profits. In the year ago quarter it earned 11,000 dlrs, or one
cent a share. For the first half of fiscal 1987, it reported a
profit of 42,000 dlrs, or two cts a share, compared to a year
earlier loss of 294,000 dlrs, or 17 cts a share.
    It said President Michael R. Hall will assume the duties of
chief executive officer.
    Physio Technology said the resignation of Chairman James C.
Lane can constitute non-compliance with its Series A
convertible subordinated debentures due 1996 and a default
under its agreement with the Merchants Bank of Kansas City.
    It explained a declaration of non-compliance under the
debentures would create a a default under the loan agreements
requiring immediate payment of 1.8 mln dlrs of debentures and
about 450,000 dlrs outstanding under the bank credit line.
    The company said the debenture holders intend to waive the
non-compliance, but reserve the right to withdraw the waiver at

board adopted a warrant dividend plan in which one preferred
stock purchase right will be distributed as a dividend on each
common share outstanding.
    The company said its warrant dividend plan is designed to
protect its shareholders against unsolicted, coercive attempts
to aquire control without making an adequate offer for all
shares.
    Reichhold said the adoption is not a response to any
specific takeover attempt.
    Reichhold said each right will entitle shareholders to buy
one one-hundreth of a share of a newly created series of
preferred stock at an initial exercise price of 120 dlrs, with
dividend and voting rights approximately equal to those of one
share of the company's common stock.
    The rights will be exercisable only if, without Reichhold's
prior consent, a person or group a acquires 20 pct or more of
the voting power or announces a tender offer which would result
in 20 pct ownership, the company said.
    Reichhold said it is entitled to redeem the rights at five
cts apiece before a 20 pct position has been acquired, or
before an existing 20 pct shareholder buys an additional two
pct or more of the voting power of the company, or in
connection with certain transactions afterward.

<VOWG.F>, VW, linked to an alleged foreign currency fraud will
not exceed the 480 mln marks provision already made, a VW
spokesman said.
    The spokesman was commenting after VW had confirmed it
would pay an unchanged 10 mark dividend for ordinary shares on
1986 business, despite the provision.
    One West German newspaper today quoted foreign currency
dealers in Frankfurt as speculating that the total losses from
the currency affair could be as high as 1.5 billion marks, but
the VW spokesman described 480 mln marks as an "upper limit."
    VW said in a statement following today's supervisory board
meeting that it had discussed the foreign currency scandal in
detail, and was setting up a new probe into its foreign
currency activities to be carried out by an unnamed auditing
company.
    VW has said computer programs were erased and documents
were faked in the alleged fraud in which it believes
transactions intended to protect it against possible foreign
currency losses were not completed.
    VW's former foreign currency chief Burkhard Junger was
arrested on Monday on suspicion of embezzlement and of having
evaded justice.
    Earlier VW had said that its 1986 results would match 1985
profits. VW's group net profit in 1985 was 596 mln marks and
parent company net was 477 mln marks. It also said it recommend
an unchanged dividend to the supervisory board. The company has
also set a dividend of 11 marks for new preference shares,
which were issued last year. Analysts have described the held
dividend as a move to reassure worried shareholders.
    VW increased nominal capital by 300 marks last year to 1.5
billion marks, with the result that its total dividend payment
on 1986 will be 306 mln marks compared with 240 mln on 1985,
since the new capital was in preference shares.
    The share analysts say VW will have to dig into reserves in
order to maintain the disclosed 1986 profit at 1985 levels. At
the end of 1985, VW had parent company reserves of slightly
less than three billion marks.

expects fiscal year earnings to improve by about 20 pct, the
company told analysts, although it said the April 30 first
quarter should show "down earnings and virtually flat
revenues."
    Chairman Charles Oswald said National Computer has taken
steps to improve margins. He said revenues are expected to
increase modestly because of the company's decision to downsize
its leasing business, nonrecurring revenueslast year from a
one-time Texas teacher assessment project and the impact of the
discontinuance of products last year.
    Oswald said National Computer's first quarter results will
be down as a result of a major financial systems sales last
year, a higher effective tax rate and the increased number of
shares outstanding.
    The company said the next three consecutive quarters should
demonstrate "excellent earnings growth."

expects to realize a second quarter after-tax gain of four dlrs
per share from the 545 mln dlr sale of its spirits business to
American Brands Inc <AMB>.
    National Distillers' stock rose 1-1/8 to 65-1/2, after an
opening delay on the New York Stock exchange for an imbalance
of orders.
    "I think the sales price was higher than most people
expected," said John Henry of E.F. Hutton Group.
    A company spokeswoman said the four dlr per share gain will
be included in second quarter net, which compares with 31 cts
per share last year, including the spirits and wine business
    "They netted over 700 mln dlrs for spirits and wine. That
will ease their interest cost burden," said Henry.
    National Distillers sold its wine business last month to
Grand Metropolitan PLC's Heublein Inc for 128 mln dlrs.
    Henry said he had anticipated National Distillers would net
only 600 mln dlrs at the most from the sale of the two liquor
businesses.
    Henry said the company recovered from the sales the cost of
buying Enron Chemicals in the fourth quarter last year.
National Distillers paid 570 mln dlrs cash for Enron and
assumed 34 mln dlrs in debt. National Distillers said at the
time it bought Enron it would sell the spirits and wine
businesses, moving more into the chemical area.
    For 1986, two thirds of income were from chemicals and
propane. National Distillers earned, excluding the liquor
businesses, 2.21 dlrs per share for 1986. Income from
discontinued operations, including the liquor businesses, was
67 cts per share.

continuing operations will exceed 1986 results and recover to
1985 levels when the company earned 152 mln U.S. dlrs or 1.70

    "We'll have a substantial increase in earnings from
continuing operations," he told reporters after the annual
meeting. He said he expected profits would recover last year's
lost ground and reach 1985 results.
    In 1986, profits from continuing operations slumped to

of 30 mln dlrs on discontinued operations.
    Goodrich said Moore is still actively looking for

manufacturing or handling.
    "We could do a large acquisition," he said when asked if
the company could raise as much as one billion dlrs for this
purpose.
    Chairman Judson Sinclair, answering a shareholder's

passed by shareholders to create a new class of preferred
shares would allow Moore to move quickly if it decided to
pursue an acquisition.
    "If we were to make a major acquisition ... it means we can
move with a certain expediency," Sinclair said.

protection from a possible hostile takeover, Sinclair said
only, "I know of no threat to the corporation at this time."

file for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
code will not affect the majority of its businesses.
    It said its subsidiaries, which account for 96 pct of its
32.6 billion dlrs in revenues and 79 pct of its net property,
plant and equipment, were free of the action.
    Only parent holding company, Texaco Inc, and operating
subsidiaries, Texaco Capital Inc and Texaco Capital N.V, are
affected, it said.
    But the company said it was likely to suspend its 75 cents
per share quarterly common stock dividend and halt repayments
on debts of some 6.8 billion dlrs.
    Texaco said it filed for Chaper 11 because suppliers were
demanding cash payments and banks were withholding loans as a
result of a legal dispute with Pennzoil Co <PZL>.
    Texaco is fighting a Texas law requiring it to post a bond
of more than 10 billion dlrs before it can appeal a 1985
judgment that ruled it illegally interfered with Pennzoil's
1984 acquisition of Getty Petroleum Corp <GTY>. The bond almost
matches the damages awarded against Texaco.
    Should Texaco fail to place the bond, Pennzoil could begin
to attach its assets to secure the judgment.
    Last Monday, the Supreme Court overturned a decision to cut
Texaco's bond to one billion dlrs, and sent the issue back to
the Texas courts.
    Analysts said the bankruptcy filing effectively froze all
Texaco's obligations while it continued to appeal the merits of
the Pennzoil lawsuit.
    "Attempts last week to win a compromise on both the bond
issue and the larger dispute failed," James Kinnear, Texaco's
president and chief executive officer, told reporters.
    Kinnear said Pennzoil's disclosure in court papers on
Friday that it wanted to extend the bond issue hearing until
the end of April, pushed Texaco further towards Chapter 11.
    Pennzoil had asked Texaco to post a 5.6 billion dlr cash
bond and to reduce its dividend to not more than 50 pct of
earnings. Pennzoil also wanted assurances that Texaco would not
sell any assets, Kinnear said.
    Texaco offered to put up one billion dlrs in a letter of
credit and agreed not to let the value of its assets fall under
11.1 billion dlrs, he added.
    Joseph Jamail, a Houston attorney for Pennzoil, said the
company had made its latest settlement offer to Texaco on
Saturday and was taken by surprise when Texaco filed for
bankruptcy.
    He declined to reveal the amount of the proposal, citing a
confidentiality agreement between the two companies. "Texaco
told us they would get back to us but instead they chose to go
to bankruptcy court," Jamail said.
    Attorneys for Pennzoil said they believed the company would
prevail in court appeals, adding that Texaco's assets were
ample ultimately to pay the Pennzoil judgment in full.

September 30. The group paid 31 cents a share and 133.1 mln

significantly up on last year in all divisions.
    It said there were good opportunities for growth in both
existing and recently acquired businesses as well as for growth
by acquisition in related areas.
    It earlier announced a 6.1 mln stg rise in pre-tax profit
to 24.8 mln stg for the year to December 28. Turnover rose to
242.1 mln from 211.5 mln.
    Most of its companies performed well despite a slowdown in
the U.S., U.K. And Australian economies in the first half.
    Currency fluctuations reduced pretax profit by around one
mln stg, it noted.
    Morgan said although profits in the electronics sector
improved to 1.0 mln stg from 100,000 stg previously, results
were nonetheless disappointing.
    Sales were lower than expected, due mainly to delayed
defence orders and cancellations. However, it said it had taken
the necessary remedial action, obtained new business and was
now proceeding with the delivery of major delayed orders.
    Morgan shares firmed two pence to 318p at 0905 GMT from

    Goodyear chairman Robert E. Mercer also told the annual

it expects to work its debt down to normal levels in three
years through its restructuring and cash flow from improved

    The company set up its restructuring program to fend off a
hostile takeover attempt by Sir James Goldsmith.  As part of
the restructuring, Goodyear executed a major stock buyback

Corp said shipments and revenues were higher in the first

    IBM said net income fell to 785 mln dlrs or 1.30 dlrs a
share from 1.02 billion dlrs or 1.65 dlrs on about 1.8 pct
fewer shares outstanding.
    While total sales and income rose 5.5 pct to 10.68 billion

    The company said it continues to take actions to make it
more competitive, including cost and expense reduction
measures.
    "Although the worldwide economic situation remains
unsettled, there are some encouraging signs in our business,"
IBM said in a statement.
    "In addition to the increase in first quarter shipments, we
have announced new offerings in our large processor and
personal computing product lines," it said.
    "We have yet to fully benefit from our recent product
announcements, retirement incentives and other resource
balancing measures, and we expect these actions will have a
more significant impact as 1987 progresses," the company added.
    It said it expects more than 12,000 U.S. employees to take

preparing a recapitalization plan, which includes a common
stock repurchase program and an exchange of debt securities for
common stock.
    The plan, along with a proposal to change its name to
Cooper Cos Inc, will be submitted for shareholders' approval at
the company's annual meeting on June 22.
    The meeting had been postponed from its original date of
May 14 in order to let management review recapitalization
options, it said.
    In addition, Coopervision said operating income in its
current fiscal quarter ending April 30 is expected to show an
improvement over its prior fiscal quarter's 82.5 mln dlrs and
its year ago quarter.
    Income from continuing operations was not immediately
availalbe for the prior year's second quarter in which it
reported a net loss of 14.9 mln dlrs.
    At a Drexel Burnham Lambert Investor Conference,
Coopervision chairman Parker Montgomery said, as previously
announced, he will listen to any bid that makes sense for
shareholders.
    He also said Coopervision's stock fell in 1986 due to its
second quarter loss, rumors of a liquidation at 30 dlrs and 35
dlrs a share, and Ivan Boesky's subsequent sale of his
position.
    "The stock dropped six dlrs in three days after Boesky sold
his position and has never recovered," Montgomery said. The
company's stock is currently trading at 19-1/4.
    Montgomery further told the conference, "Don't be an
investor in the stock on the basis of any short term recovery
in operating or net income in 1987 and 1988."
    "Our concentration is on maintaining or increasing market
share in our core businesses this year and next, regardless of
the impact to the bottom line," he said.

First quarter revenues increased to 1.12 billion dlrs from

audit of its Stearns Airport Equiment Co Inc unit, revealed
"substantial discrepancies" in Stearns accounts that may
require material adjustments to previously announce
consolidated results of the company and its subsidiaries.
    Foster said certain Stearn officers and senior management
made Stearn's operations appear more profitable than they were
by improperly recording job costs. It said Stearn's president
and controller had resigned. A Foster spokesman said he did not
know the names of the president and controller, and could not
immediately comment on the release.
    Foster said the amount involved in the "discrepancy" is
about 13.7 mln dlrs before taxes or about 8.2 mln dlrs net
after tax due to an "improper recording of job costs over a
period of several years and continuing through part of the
first quarter of 1987."
    Stearns is a unit of Foster's Conergic Corp subsidiary.
The company said the impact on its results for 1987 was not
"likely to be significant" but the amount to be charged to
prior periods had not been determined.
    Foster reported after tax earnings of 28 mln dlrs, 26 mln
dlrs and 35.4 mln dlrs for 1986, 1985, and 1984, respectively.
    Stearns, based in Crowley, Texas, makes airport baggage
conveyor equipment and passenger loading bridges.
    Foster, a diversified international concern with 27
subsidiaries operating worldwide, is based in Livingston, New
Jersey. Its reported revenues for the period ended December 26,

first-quarter profits fell by 16 pct, largely because it placed
1.04 billion dlrs of loans to Brazil on non-accrual.
    Chemical reported first-quarter net income of 86.2 mln
dlrs, down from 102.6 mln a year earlier, but declaring the
Brazilian loans non-performing cost Chemical 21 mln dlrs in
lost interest income, or 12 mln dlrs after-tax.
    A 13.3 pct jump in non-interest expense to 471.3 mln dlrs
from 415.9 mln also hit the bottom line. It said the rise was
mainly due to staff costs associated with continued growth in
consumer, capital markets and investment banking activities.
    Excluding the effect of placing Brazil on non-accrual,
Chemical said its net income would have been 98.2 mln dlrs, or
4.3 pct below 1986 earnings.
    Brazil suspended interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of
medium- and long-term debt on February 20. If they are not
resumed by year's end, Chemical said its after-tax net for the
whole of 1987 will be reduced by about 51 mln dlrs.
    Chemical also placed 52 mln dlrs of loans to Ecuador on
non-accrual because the Quito government also suspended
interest payments on its foreign debt. This reduced interest
income by 1.5 mln dlrs.
    Chemical said net interest income fell to 476.4 mln dlrs
from 488.9 mln and its net spread narrowed to 3.61 pct from
3.96 pct.
    This reflected the reclassification of Brazilian loans, a
reduced federal income tax rate (which affected the calculation
of the taxabale-equivalent adjustment on tax-exempt assets) and
a narrowing of the spread between the prime rate and Chemical's
cost of funds.
    Foreign exchange trading profits rose to 37.9 mln dlrs from
27.0 mln, but bond trading profits dropped to 21.9 mln dlrs
from 26.2 mln.
    Fees from trust and other banking services rose to 146.5
mln dlrs from 129.3 mln a year earlier, Chemical said.
    The provision for loan losses was 87.2 mln dlrs, compared
with 83.8 mln. Net loan charge-offs were 86.5 mln, up from 60.7
mln, leaving the allowance for loan losses at 672.6 mln dlrs at
quarter's end, or 1.74 pct of loans outstanding, compared with
594.3 mln, or 1.50 pct, a year earlier.
    Non-accruing loans at the end of March were 2.39 billion
dlrs (1.35 billion excluding Brazil), compared with 1.35
billion at the end of 1986 and 1.22 billion at the end of
March, 1986.

    The company said the losses result from its strategic
decision to invest prudent levels of equity in development of
products the company can manufacture and bring to market.
    Genetics earlier said first quarter ended February 28
losses rose to 1,309,000 dlrs from year-ago loss of 937,000

higher loans and core deposit volumes as well as a substantial
increase in net interest income contributed to a 16 pct rise in
first-quarter earnings to 17.7 mln dlrs from 15.3 mln reported
a year earlier.
    The earnings gain came despite a 1.5 mln dlr reduction of
income as a result of placing Brazilian loans on non-accrual.
    Net interest income totalled 92.5 mln dlrs compared with
91.7 mln dlrs in the same 1986 period as loans, mostly to
middle market businesses, increased by 896 mln dlrs. But some
of these gains were offset by low levels of interest rates.
    Provision for loan losses rose to 13.8 mln dlrs from 13.0
mln a year earlier. At March 31, the allowance for loan losses
was 114.2 mln dlrs versus 94.8 mln at end of March 1986.
    Non-accrual loans rose to 286 mln dlrs from 132 mln at the
end of the first quarter of 1986, largely because 119 mln dlrs
of loans to Brazil were put on non-accrual status.
    The bank said that if these loans remain on non-accrual for
the remainder of the year net income for 1987 would be reduced
by about 4.9 mln dlrs.
    National Westminster Bank USA is a wholly-owned subsidiary
of National Westminster Bank PLC.

has started the year aggressively, but industry analysts said
the company still faces some tough rounds in its fight to stop
a two-year earnings slump.
    "I am more impressed with what's happening at IBM than I
have been in a long time," said PaineWebber analyst Stephen
Smith.
    "But they're not out of the woods yet," he added.
    At 1.30 dlrs a share, IBM's first-quarter net income easily
topped most estimates on Wall Street, which had ranged from an
even dollar to 1.20 dlrs.
    Most analysts said they were pleasantly surprised by IBM's
performance. But they indicated that IBM's chances for a full
recovery hinged on several key factors whose impact will not be
felt until later in the year.
    These include the success of IBM's new personal computer
line, introduced two weeks ago, and its 9370 minicomputers,
which will begin volume shipments in July.
    In addition, IBM has said the full benefits of its
early-retirement program and other cost-cutting moves will
emerge as the year progresses.
    Analysts noted that IBM chairman John F. Akers was
relatively more upbeat in assessing the company's outlook than
he has been for nearly a year.
    "Although the worldwide economic situation remains
unsettled, there are some encouraging signs in our business,"
Akers said, pointing to, among other things, higher
first-quarter shipments. "We remain optimistic about the
prospects for both the industry and IBM," he said.
    "Akers was most encouraging," said PaineWebber's Smith.
    A weak dollar, a lower tax rate and strong mainframe
computer sales all contributed to the better-than-expected
first-quarter results, analysts said.
    "Shipments of the 3090 mainframes were very strong in
March," after a weak January and February, said Ulric Weil of
Washington-based Weil and Associates.
    Sales of the top-of-the-line mainframes, commonly called
the Sierras, "bailed out the whole quarter," Weil said, adding,
"If this continues, it augers well for the rest of the year."

in first-quarter net income from a year earlier was largely the
result of placing medium- and long-term loans to borrowers in
Brazil and Ecuador on non-accrual status.
    Income in the first three months fell to 28.60 mln dlrs
from 30.43 mln in the same 1986 period. Earnings per share
dropped to 1.51 dlrs from 1.62.
    Irving put 215 mln dlrs of Brazilian and 33 mln dlrs of
Ecuadorean loans on non-accrual, reducing first-quarter net
income by a total of 4.4 mln dlrs after tax.
    Irving estimates full year net would be reduced by 15.3 mln
dlrs after tax if no cash interest payments are received on
these loans during the remainder of 1987.
    Also adversely affecting earnings were losses on the
trading of securities and higher non-interest expenses,
although these were partly offset by increased trust income,
profits from foreign exchange trading and investment securities
gains, the bank said.
    The allowance for loan losses was 224.8 mln dlrs, up from
185.2 mln a year earlier. The provision for loan losses was
21.8 mln versus 19.5 mln in the first quarter of 1986.

first quarter net income reflects a 121 mln dlr loss from its
50 pct share ownership of U.S. Sprint's operations.
    This loss is an increase from the 60 mln dlrs loss reported
on operations GTE owned a year ago quarter and prior to
entering a joint venture with United Telecommunications <UT> in
July 1986. Under the joint venture, each company owns 50 pct of
Sprint.
    Earlier, the company reported net income declined to 265.0
mln dlrs from 283.0 mln dlrs in the first quarter a year ago.
    Theodore Brophy, chairman of GTE said, "we expect US
Sprint's losses to diminish later this year as customer traffic
migrates to the new fiber-optic network for long distance
telecommunications.
    The reason for the higher losses reflect lower prices as
well as higher operating costs related, in part, to the
fraudalent use of the network.
    Operating income of its telephone operations, which account
for 91 pct of the total, rose eight pct to 736.0 mln dlrs.

    Addressing a gathering of analysts and institutional

    He also said the first quarter estimates were 70 pct higher

Marshall attributibuted the first quarter earnings growth to
several factors, including sustained demand in Aristech's major
domestic markets and continued growth in exports.

capital investments over the next three years, Marshall added.

five to 10 mln dlr suit against a Browning-Ferris Industries

drop today, analysts said.
    The stock has fallen 2-1/4 to 56-1/8 so far today, after
the news about the suit was released this morning.
    "It's potentially a big suit and investors feel that its
not good to go against regulators," Kenneth Ch'u-K'ai Leung, a
Smith Barney analyst said.
    "What investors are actually saying by selling off some BFI
shares is the cloud over this industry is the threat that the
EPA will get tough on waste management companies," Willard
Brown, senior analyst for First Albany Corp.
    "Investors are saying to themselves that waste management
companies have that kind of exposure to regulatory suits,"
Brown said. Brown said if the suit were settled for 10 mln dlrs
it would have an impact on Browning Ferris earnings.
    Leung said, however, that Browning-Ferris has adequate cash
reserves to cover the fine. "It would have no impact on
earnings whatsoever," he said.

20.1 pct in its 1987 first quarter operating earnings was the
result of cost cutting efforts which began last year.
    Honeywell reported 1987 first quarter operating earnings
rose to 43.7 mln dlrs or 96 cts a share from 36.4 mln dlrs or
79 cts in the same period a year ago.
    Better operating results in each of the company's three 
sectors offset higher interest costs in the first quarter due
to financing the December acquisition of Sperry Aerospace and
the sharing of the Federal Systems subsidiary pre-tax profit
with Honeywell Bull Inc, Honeywell said.
    "Our first quarter results show clear benefits of our
restructuring," chairman Edson Spencer said. "All of our
businesses are producing better results than last year, even
though we do not see significant improvement in the external
market environment," he said.
    Total orders in the first quarter were up substantially,
with a sharp increase in aerospace and defense orders in
addition to those of the new Sperry Aerospace group, it said.
    Domestic industrial automation and control orders were
modestly higher than the same period in 1986, it said.
    Orders in Honeywell's home and building automation and
control business were flat in the U.S. and up in international
markets, it said.
    International orders increased, with the greatest strength
in Europe, Honeywell said.
    The company said that by year-end 1987, it intends to
complete the repurchase of 3.3 mln shares remaining of a five
mln share buyback program which began in 1986.

has restated its earnings for the fiscal year ended June 30,
1986 to provide an additional five mln dlrs to its loan loss
allowance, causing a restated year-end net loss of 14,937,000
dlrs, instead of 9,937,000 dlrs.
    The company said the change came after talks with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on the company's judgement
in considering the five mln dlrs collectible.
    In the note to its 1986 financial statement, American
Century said it considered the five mln dlrs collectible,
making its loan loss provision less than required.
    The company said in spite of the SEC decision, it still
feels its allowance for possible loan losses at June 30, 1986
was adequate and that it has considered all relevant
information to determine the collectibility of the five mln dlr
receivable.
    But, it said continued disagreement with the SEC staff
would not be in its best interest.

billion dlrs in assets, said it will report a loss of 13 mln
dlrs for the second quarter due to its decision to increase its
provision for losses by 30 mln dlrs, mainly due to
uncertainties surrounding Latin American debt.
    In the second quarter last year, Merchants reported net
income of 6.2 mln dlrs or 68 cts a share.
    As a result of the increased loan loss provision, the bank
said the allowance for loan losses will increase from 1.4 pct
to 2.5 pct of the bank's total loans. The bank said its expects
to report estimated net of over 15 mln dlrs for 1987.

Madison Partners said that given current market conditions it
has dropped its takeover bid for Dayton Hudson Corp.
    The company said it sold 1.4 mln of its 4.6 mln shares of
Dayton Hudson stock.
    It said it intends to sell the rest of its Dayton Hudson
shares. At current market levels, it would suffer a 70 mln dlr
aftertax loss on its holding, a spokesman said.
    Dart said it will not solicit authorization to call a
meeting of Dayton Hudson shareholders.
    Dart had offered to buy Dayton Hudson for 68 dlrs per
share, valuing the Minneapolis based retailer at 6.6 billion
dlrs. That offer was rejected by the company.
    Following the selloff in takeover stocks last week, and the
market's decline this week, Dayton Hudson stock closed at
27-1/2 today, off 2-1/2.
    Dart's holdings amounted to just under five pct of Dayton
Hudson.
    A Dart spokesman said the 1.4 mln shares were sold in the
market today.
