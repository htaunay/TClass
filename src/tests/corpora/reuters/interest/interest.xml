rate for state financial institutions to 5.5 pct from 6.2 as
part of the recent pact by major industrial nations in Paris,
Finance Ministry sources said.
    They said the cut is based on a revision of the Trust Fund
Bureau Law, which should be approved by parliament on March 3,
abolishing the 6.05 pct minimum interest rate on deposits with
the bureau.
    The bureau channels funds to government financial
institutions for public works and other official uses, they
said.
    The base lending rate for state bodies such as the Japan
Development Bank, People's Finance Corp and the finance
corporations of local public enterprises usually moves in
tandem with long-term prime rates, the sources said.
    However, it was impossible for them to follow the last cut,
to 5.8 pct from 6.2 pct on January 28, because the Trust Fund
Bureau rate was legally set at 6.05 pct.
    The ministry will abolish the minimum rate and introduce a
market-related one to resolve the problem and stimulate the
domestic economy, they said.
    On Tuesday, the ministry allowed long-term bankers to cut
their prime to a record low of 5.5 pct, effective February 28.
The move suggested it had reached agreement with depositors
using the bureau, the postal savings system of the Posts and
Telecommunications Ministry and the Japan welfare annuity of
the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the sources said.
    These ministries are trying to determine which market rates
should be considered when setting the bureau's deposit rate,
the ministry sources said.
    Coupon rates on new 10-year government bonds, minus 0.1
percentage points, is the likeliest choice, they added.

board meeting to promote further interest rate liberalisation
by lowering the minimum denomination of regulation-free large
deposits and by raising the interest rate ceiling on money
market certificates (MMCs), a central bank official said.
    The new guideline will go into effect on April 6, the bank
said.
    Under the guideline, the minimum denomination of
regulation-free large deposits will be lowered to 100 mln yen
from 300 mln.
    The interest rate ceiling of MMCs with maturities of
between one year and two years will be set at 0.5 percentage
point below the prevailing certificate of deposit rate, the
bank said.
    But the ceiling on MMCs with maturities of one year or less
will remain the same, or 0.75 percentage point below the CD
rates.
    The minimum denomination of MMCs will be lowered to 10 mln
yen from 30 mln.
    The bank also said time deposit rates will be lowered by
0.37 point, effective March 16, in line with the half-point cut
in the official discount rate on February 23.
    New interest rates on two-year and one-year deposits at
banks, for example, will be 3.64 pct and 3.39 pct per annum,
respectively.
    Demand deposit rates, however, will remain the same.

deposit rates in an effort to raise competition among banks and

ministry spokesman said.
    The measure was published today in the Official State
Gazette. It takes effect tomorrow and lifts restrictions on
rates, now limited to six pct on deposits of up to 180 days.
    The government also enacted a decree cutting to one pct
from 13 pct the proportion of total assets which banks must
lend at favourable rates to industries classified "of public
interest."
    Some bankers expect the deregulation of rates to result in
a 20 pct drop in profits this year.

 ]]></BODY><BODY><![CDATA[Bankers welcomed the Bank of Spain's
decision to raise the reserve requirement for banks and savings
banks, saying it reflected the socialist government's
determination not to ease up in the fight against inflation
despite the painful social effects of four years of austerity.
    The central bank last night raised the requirement by one
percentage point to 19 pct from March 13, saying that excess
liquidity threatened money supply and inflation targets.
    Bankers said the move represented a change of tactic by the
Bank, which until now has relied on raising interest rates to
choke off money supply growth.
    "I think it's a good measure," a senior foreign banker said.
"It's a faster way to get the job done than using interest rates
and avoids unpleasant effects on other areas of the economy."
    "It shows that the political will is very strong. They know
that controlling inflation will make industry more competitive
and bring down unemployment in the long run," he added.
    The head of another foreign bank said that only a month
ago, the Bank of Spain had dismissed his suggestion of a rise
in reserve requirements, preferring to pursue its strategy of
raising interest rates.
    But bankers said the high real interest rates on offer now
-- around eight pct for overnight funds -- was attracting money
from abroad, strengthening the peseta and making Spanish
exports less competitive.
    The government says industry's competitiveness is also
being hit hard by inflation. At 8.3 pct last year, the rate was
way above that of Spain's major trading partners in the
European Community, which it joined a year ago.
    To help meet this year's target of five pct, it is
insisting pay rises stay at that level, setting the stage for
clashes with trade unions, who say they have made enough
sacrifices.
    Demonstrations by workers, students and farmers, whose
demands essentially involve more government spending, have
become an almost daily occurrence. But Prime Minister Felipe
Gonzalez insists that the state is doing as much as it can.
    Bankers said the reserve requirement increase could have
some impact on commercial lending rates but should not hit the
money market too hard.
    The Bank of Spain, which only yesterday raised its key
overnight call money rate to 13.5 pct, left it unchanged at
today's auction. The rate has been increased nine times since
the start of the year, when it was below 12 pct.
    Bankers said commercial lending rates were set to rise in
any case with the end of the six pct maximium interest rate
banks can offer for time deposits of up to six months.
    The measure will take effect tomorrow, following the
publication of the decree in today's official gazette. Bankers
say the liberalisation will increase the cost of funds and,
inevitably, push lending rates higher.
    A companion measure, reducing the proportion of funds which
banks must invest in specific areas, also takes effect
tomorrow. Officials said when the cut was approved last month
that it was aimed partly at compensating banks for higher
interest rates.

    Most economists said they did not expect the Fed to add

the need to add reserves in the current bank reserve

 ]]></BODY><BODY><![CDATA[The Bank of England again fought against
money and bond market pressure for a pre-Budget interest rate
cut, leaving the pound to take the strain with a further rise
in its trade-weighted index to a six-month high.
    It closed at its best level since September 12, at 71.4 pct
of its 1975 value on the index, as foreign investors continued
to buy into a currency which offers high relative returns and
the possibility of short-term capital gains, dealers said.
    Meanwhile, opinion is divided over whether the Bank can
stop a cut before Budget Day, March 17, and why it should want
to.
    The Bank's latest strong signal to the market that it wants
rates to stay steady for the moment came in midafternoon, when
it lent to the discount houses at a penal rate of 11-3/4 pct to
relieve a money market shortage.
    "They're really making the discount houses suffer," said
Stephen Lewis, economist at brokerage house Phillips and Drew.
"Eleven and three-quarters pct is way above money market rates."
    This money market signal was apparently not accompanied by
any sterling sales on the foreign exchanges, talk of which had
inhibited strong rises yesterday and Tuesday, so buyers came
strongly into the pound.
    The pound surged to a high of 1.5798/808 dlrs at the London
close, up from the previous finish at 1.5650/60, and 2.8900/60
marks, up from 2.8720/50.
    "If this pressure keeps up...There is a possibility that
rates could drop before the Budget," said Jeremy Hale, economist
at finance house Goldman Sachs International Corp.
    Some gilt traders are forecasting a half-point cut in the
base rate from the current 11 pct as early as tomorrow.
    However, analysts said the Bank of England will need to be
convinced that the present rise is a fundamental re-rating
rather than a result of short-term speculative gains.
    There are valid reasons for the Bank to be cautious, said
Peter Fellner, U.K. Economist at brokers James Capel and Co.
    Markets have become highly optimistic about the chances of
a Conservative Party victory in any early general election, and
disappointment if Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher decides to
hold back could lead to a decline in the pound and a setback
for bonds, Fellner said.
    An election could be delayed until mid-1988, but most
forecasts say it will be this year.
    Others note that the pound could yet prove vulnerable to
oil price losses or a change of fortune for the dollar.
    However, analysts agree the Bank is largely trying to set
the timing of a cut than holding out against one altogether.
    The authorities traditionally prefer a single sustainable
rate move, one way or the other, to half points here and there.
    Some add the Bank will be influenced by signs that at least
a proportion of the latest bout of sterling buying is long-term
capital coming into the London market, notably from Japan.
    They argue that the pound is being perceived as a safer bet
than the dollar, given the latters recent sharp falls and
current political upheavals in Washington.
    The Bank may want to see another few points on the
trade-weighted index before the Budget, argued Lewis. "But by
then sterling should be firm enough to satisfy even the Bank of
England," he added.
    The Bank declined to comment on its reasons for resisting
pressure for a rate move before the budget, but banking sources
said the authorities see the recent rise in sterling as more
than just marking up by foreign exchange traders.
    Meanwhile, analysts noted the market ignored potentially
harmful news on the trade front, today's figures showing that
the current account deficit in 1986 was 1.1 billion stg.
    This was above previous estimates of the current account
deficit and compares with a surplus of 2.9 billion stg in 1985.
    Fellner said that under more normal conditions this would
have given the bond and currency markets a pause, but that they
were too bullish to worry about such fundamentals.
    The guessing game over the timing of a cut has the clearing
banks divided as well as the markets. Privately, some bank
officials forecast the Bank will hold out at least for this
week, but at least one bank says a rise is possible tomorrow.
If a move comes before March 17, forecasts are for a half-point
cut, with another half or full point about Budget day.

 ]]></BODY><BODY><![CDATA[This week's Bank of England resistance to
strong market pressure for lower interest rates succeeded in
holding bank base rates at 11 pct.
    But at a cost of threatening the Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawson's policy, stated at the end of the Paris
Group of Six meeting last month, that he wanted to see sterling
broadly stable about then prevailing levels, market sources
said.
    Since then, the pound has risen to 71.8 pct on its closing
trade-weighted index, up from 69.7 pct imediately after the
Paris meeting and up 0.4 on the day.
    Today's peak at 72.0 pct was its highest since August 19.
    A Treasury spokesman said Lawson had said he neither wanted
a substantial rise or fall in sterling. The question is
therefore how large a rise he is ready to see before acting.
    Paul Temperton, chief economist at Merrill Lynch Europe
Ltd, estimated that the government wanted to see the
trade-weighted index about 72-73 pct. "Even after this action
over the last few weeks, sterling's only just within striking
distance of that range," he said.
    Other analysts agree that the government probably has some
broad target range around this area.
    However, they said Lawson would be prepared to see the
pound go higher at least in the short term, despite the risk of
a loss of export competitiveness and cheaper prices on imports.
    "If the Bank of England keeps the interest rates as they
are, what's to stop it (going higher)," said John Cox, executive
director of EBC Amro Bank Ltd, a major operator on the London
foreign exchange market.
    Cox estimates that the Bank of England has been active
selling sterling over the past few days, despite the lack of
general market talk of such intervention, and this has helped
keep it below 1.60 dlrs.
    The pound rose to 1.5870 dlrs from 1.5764 yesterday and
1.5400 February 23, the day after the Paris meeting.
    But Cox says the government must be worried with sterling
heading toward 2.95 marks and would be very concerned if it
holds around these levels.
    He warned the Bank may run the risk of missing the interest
rate boat. "If rates don't come down, the market will say they
ought to have come down and will sell sterling," he said.
    Most dealers agree there is a good deal of "hot money" being
invested in sterling, money simply attracted by high overnight
or one-week rates, which could flow out at equally short
notice.
    However, the authorities will hope that at least a
proportion of the buying reflects long-term investment.
    "The last thing they want to do is reduce them (rates) and
have to jack them back up again," said Richard Jeffrey,
economist at brokerage house Hoare Govett Ltd.
    He said a half point cut would ensure continued support for
sterling, at least in the near term.
    However, most analysts are still looking for a full point
about March 17, Budget Day.
    The Bank must hold out until it sees the reaction to the
Budget, said Temperton.
    The Budget is widely forecast to be a vote winner in the
run-up to a general election, the major factor behind current
bullishness in the government bond and currency markets.
    "Lawson wants to delay a cut in base rates until the budget.
He wants it to be crowned with the glory of an interest rate
cut," said Ian Harwood, economist at Warburg Securities, the
equities arm of Mercury International Group.
    Speculation a clearing bank might break ranks and lead the
way lower were confounded today. There was excitement a fall in
the weekly Treasury Bill rate to 9.7 pct from 10.2 pct last
Friday might mean the Bank had changed its mind.
    This followed the imposition of penal lending rates of 11
3/4 pct on the discount houses yesterday, and was the lowest
since base rates were at 10 pct, early last October.
    However, with this Bill rate pertaining to three-months
money, banking sources said the market could not take the cut
as a guide to the Bank's intentions on short term rates.

needs and a growing unwillingness by foreign investors to buy
mark assets could push yields in German public authority bonds
higher this year, bond market sources say.
    "At the moment we have a sideways movement in the short-term
rates. But how rates move in the long end will depend strongly
on foreigners," one portfolio manager for a large securities
investment house in Frankfurt said.
    The sources also said the government had already stepped up
its borrowing programme in anticipation on increased needs.
    Friday's loan stock was the third this year already, the
sources noted. It carried a 10-year maturity, a coupon of six
pct and price of 100-1/4 to yield 5.97 pct at issue.
    This compared with the last issue which had a 5-3/4 pct
coupon priced at 99-3/4 pct for a yield of 5.75 pct.
    But dealers said the terms were not enough to attract
foreign investors, and the federal government would have to
push yields higher in future if it wanted to borrow again soon.
    Sources noted federal government issues had also increased
in size, with the introduction of a four billion mark volume
only starting last May.
    One finance ministry economist said "It isn't more. It's
just the size (of each bond) which has increased." He added
conditions in the capital market currently remained fairly
favourable for raising new debt.
    Until recently, federal issues sold very strongly abroad,
with up to 90 pct of some being placed with foreign investors.
    With the recent stabilisation of the U.S. Dollar, however,
foreign investors have begun to back away from the market, as
hopes of further currency gains in marks diminish.
    Sources said the government has may have already stepped up
its borrowing, having raised more than 18 billion marks.
    The government made net borrowings of 23 billion marks in
1986. But Bundesbank statistics showed that net borrowing
through bonds was 26.6 billion.
    The sources said this indicated a move by the government
out of other types of debt to gain access to foreign funds
through the more acceptable loan stock form.
    Although new credit needs were partly inflated by a large
amount of issues maturing recently, other factors, including
the government's tax reduction program, would also reduce
income next year. "The problem here will be the tax reform," the
portfolio manager said.
    He added that the government's cut in its top income tax
rate to 53 pct from 56 pct in 1988 would make it difficult for
the government to reduce borrowings.
    The sources said the government would fall far short of
covering all of its 40 billion marks in lost revenue from the
tax reform by making expenditure cuts and would be forced to
fall back on debt markets in one form or the other.
    The portfolio manager noted that besides the three federal
government loan stocks so far this year, it has also fallen
back twice to raise a total 6.43 billion marks through the
issue of fixed-rate medium-term "Kassenobligation" notes.
    A finance ministry economist said the government did not
expect to have any trouble keeping to its plan to borrow only a
net 22.3 billion marks this year.
    Though many sources agreed, they added that the trend would
probably not continue next year as the further tax cuts come
into effect.
    "I would expect the efforts for a further tax reform would
mean government borrowing will increase," the manager said.
    Bond prices last week were slightly firmer on balance, with
the Bundesbank's public authority bond yield calculation
falling to 5.64 pct on Friday from 5.66 a week earlier.
    But sources said foreign demand for the new federal
government loan stock was slack, as sentiment grows that the
dollar may now rise against the mark.
    "The demand wasn't so good," a dealer for a German bank in
London said.
    The dollar's recent slight appreciation against the mark
even meant that foreign investors have sold mark bonds
recently, some dealers said.

    Until the end of last week, the central was holding out

onto its books a further one billion stg tranche of 8-3/4 pct
Treasury Loan stock due 1997, payable 40 stg pct on
application. The stock was issued to the Bank at 96.50 stg pct
and will be available for dealings from March 11, with the
remainder of the amount payable on May 5. The Bank said the
bonds would yield 9.28 pct at the issue price and would be free
of tax to residents overseas. The issue would be designated
8-3/4 pct Treasury Loan 1997 "B."  A further 100 mln stg was
reserved for the National Debt Commissioners.
    The market dropped by up to 1/2 point following the Bank's
announcement, with the Treasury 13-1/2 pct stock due 2004/08
quoted one full point lower at 134-12/32 stg pct around 20
minutes after the news.
    Dealers said the announcement had to be viewed against the
backdrop of intense pressure for lower U.K. Interest rates
which had built up over the past two weeks as a result of
sterling's strength.
    The Bank this morning finally signalled it was prepared to
see lower rates and U.K. Clearing banks this afternoon
announced cuts in their base lending rates to 10.5 pct from 11
pct.
    The Bank had initially been reluctant to countenance a rate
cut because, dealers said, the authorities had wished to delay
a reduction until around the time of the U.K. Budget on March
17, thereby preserving the full impact of Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawson's package of measures.
    However, in the face of sterling's apparently inexorable
climb, the authorities today decided to cede to pressure and
allow a half-point cut.
    Today's one billion stg tap issue was viewed by the market
as a move by the Bank to eradicate hopes for a further early
rate cut which might arise as a result of strong sterling.
    Most market participants believe that Lawson will now
foster a further half point interest rate reduction at the time
of the budget, although one or two said they would not be
surprised to see a full point decline at this stage.
    Dealers noted that as part of the authorities' attempts
last week to ease pressure for lower rates, the Bank had issued
a one billion stg tap stock with a view to subduing the
Government bond market.
    To the surprise of most participants, the issue was sold
out within hours of becoming available for trading and the
market pushed on to register further sharp gains.
    Dealers said that at this stage it seemed unlikely that the
issue announced today would be absorbed by the market as
rapidly as last week's.
    However, they noted that although sterling had edged down
from its highs following the base rate cut, it had still closed
on a trade-weighted basis at 72.4, well ahead of Friday's final
71.8 and only just beneath the peak of 72.5 touched at 1300
GMT.

borrowing forward into the first half of 1987 because it
expects global interest rates to rise by year end, World Bank
vice president and treasurer Eugene Rotberg said.
    He told a news conference that rates in the U.S., Japan,
West Germany and Switzerland were near their lows. "The weight
of opinion is (that in a year from now) there is a higher
probability there will be one pct higher than one pct lower
interest rates," he said.
    The World Bank had not issued floating rate notes so far
this year because of the expectation of higher interest rates.
    The policy of the World Bank was to maintain liquidity at a
level that gave the bank flexibility to decide when, where and
how much to borrow, Rotberg said.
    Cash in hand was now about 50 pct of the next three years'
anticipated net requirement and comprised 25 pct of outstanding
debt and 66 pct of its debt maturing within five years.
    Although the World Bank had pioneered the swap market, it
did not intend to launch new financial instruments just for the
sake of innovation, Rotberg said.
    Of a total of 74.5 billion dlrs debt outstanding, only some
eight billion had been swapped into another currency.
    Many recent innovations were either unfair to investors or
unfair to borrowers. Until the World Bank was confident that
this was not the case, it would not adopt new instruments.
    The World Bank would raise 90 pct of the funds needed over
the next year with methods used before, Rotberg said. However,
for some 10 pct of new requirements the bank would try out new
instruments such as bonds with warrants.
    The World Bank had publicly offered 60 bonds in Germany
since the first issue was launched in 1959, he said.

commercial banks to seriously consider accepting a novel
Philippine proposal for paying its interest bill and believes
the innovation is fully consistent with its Third World debt
strategy, a Reagan administration official said.
    The official's comments also suggest that debtors' pleas
for interest rate concessions should be treated much more
seriously by the commercial banks, in cases where developing
nations are carrying out genuine economic reforms.
    In addition, he signaled that the banks might want to
reconsider the idea of a "megabank," where Third World debt would
be pooled, and suggested the administration would support such
a plan, even though it was not formally proposing it. At the
same time, however, the official expressed reservations that
such a scheme would ever get off the ground.
    The Philippine proposal, together with Argentine
suggestions that "exit bonds" be issued to end the troublesome
role of small banks in the debt strategy, would help to
underpin the flagging role of private banks within the plan,
the official said in an interview with Reuters.
    "All of these things would fit within the definition of our
initiative as we have asked it and we think any novel and
unique approach such as those should be considered," said the
official, who asked not to be named.
    In October 1985, Washington outlined a debt crisis strategy
under which commercial banks and multilateral institutions such
as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
were urged to step up lending to major debtors nations.
    In return, America called on the debtor countries to enact
economic reforms promoting inflation-free economic growth.
    "The multilaterals have been performing well, the debtors
have been performing well," said the official. But he admitted
that the largest Third World debtor, Brazil, was clearly an
exception.
    The official, who played a key role in developing the U.S.
Debt strategy and is an administration economic policymaker,
also said these new ideas would help commercial banks improve
their role in resolving the Third World debt crisis.
    "We called at the very beginning for the bank syndications
to find procedures or processes whereby they could operate more
effectively," the official said.
    Among those ideas, the official said, were suggestions that
commercial banks create a "megabank" which could swap Third World
debt paper for so-called "exit bonds" for banks like regional
American or European institutions.
    Such bonds in theory would rid these banks of the need to
lend money to their former debtors every time a new money
package was assembled, and has been suggested by Argentina in
its current negotiations for a new loan of 2.15 billion dlrs.
    He emphasised that the "megabank" was not an administration
plan but "something some people have suggested."
    Other U.S. Officials said Japanese commercial banks are
examining the creation of a consortium bank to assume Third
World debt. This plan, actively under consideration, would
differ slightly from the one the official described.
    But the official expressed deep misgivings that such a plan
would work in the United States.
    "If the banks thought that that was a suitable way to go,
fine. I don't think they ever will."
    He pointed out that banks would swap their Third World
loans for capital in the megabank and might then be reluctant
to provide new money to debtors through the new institution.
    Meanwhile, the official praised the Philippine plan under
which it would make interest payments on its debt in cash at no
more than 5/8 pct above Libor.
    "The Philippine proposal is very interesting, it's quite
unique and I don't think it's something that should be
categorically rejected out of hand," the official said.
    Banks which found this level unacceptably low would be
offered an alternative of Libor payments in cash and a margin
above that of one pct in the form of Philippine Investment
Notes.
    These tradeable, dollar-denominated notes would have a
six-year life and if banks swapped them for cash before
maturity, the country would guarantee a payment of 7/8 point
over Libor.
    Until now, bankers have criticised these spreads as far too
low. The talks, now in their second week, are aimed at
stretching out repayments of 3.6 billion dlrs of debt and
granting easier terms on 5.8 billion of already rescheduled
debt. The country, which has enjoyed strong political support
in Washington since Corazon Aquino came to power early last
year, owes an overall 27.8 billion dlrs of debt.
    But the official denied the plan amounts to interest rate
capitalisation, a development until now unacceptable to the
banks. "It's no more interest rate capitalisation than if you
have a write down in the spread over Libor from what existed
before," the official said in comments suggesting some ought to
be granted the rate concessions they seek. "Some people argue
that (cutting the spread) is debt forgiveness... What it really
is is narrowing the spread on new money," he added.
    He said the U.S. Debt strategy is sufficiently broad as an
initiative to include plans like the Philippines'.

Francisco Gros will meet senior commercial bankers here today
in a new attempt to defuse the anger generated by the country's
unilateral suspension of interest payments on 68 billion dlrs
of foreign commercial bank debt, bankers said.
    Gros will meet representatives of Citibank, the head of
Brazil's bank advisory committee, and of co-heads Morgan
Guaranty Trust Co and Lloyds Bank Plc.
    High on the agenda will be banks' complaints about Brazil's
accompanying freeze on some 15 billion dlrs of short-term trade
and interbank lines, the bankers said.
    Brazil's several hundred creditor banks worldwide agreed
last March to extend the credit lines until March 31, 1987, as
part of a 31 billion dlr financing package.
    Bankers said the looming expiry of this commitment, coupled
with Brazil's freeze, raised a spate of technical and legal
questions that the banks want to discuss with Gros.
    They said they face problems because of the freeze
requirement that any payment due to be made by a Brazilian bank
under the trade facility must be deposited instead with the
central bank. This means foreign bankers cannot easily switch
their credit lines from one borrower to another.
    The requirement to deposit with the central bank has also
meant Brazilian banks have been able to negotiate lower
interest-rate spreads, because foreign banks would rather
accept a reduced margin than see their money deposited with the
central bank.
    "It's caused a lot of ill-will with the banking community,"
one banker said.
    Gros is also expected to brief the banks on the results of
a 10-day tour of Europe and Japan that he and finance minister
Dilson Funaro have just completed to seek official support for
Brazil's debt stance.

lower even after Monday's half-point cut in bank base rates to
10-1/2 pct, analysts said, citing as evidence the suspension of
a British National Savings issue yesterday.
    The Department of National Savings, effectively a Treasury
Department unit, yesterday suspended its 32nd issue, launched
in October and paying a high tax-free 8-3/4 pct on five-year
private investments between 25 and 5,000 stg. A spokesman said
the suspension was just a reaction to yields on national
savings bonds being way out of line with the rest of the
market.
    The move was followed by a surprise sell-out within minutes
today of a Bank of England one-billion stg tap issue, the
second such issue in as many weeks, analysts noted.
    They said the near-instant sale of the entire new gilts
issue, for which the Bank of England had required a high 40 pct
downpayment, was clear evidence that the market thought rates
had to drop sooner rather than later.
    The sale of the tranche of 8-3/4 pct treasury bonds due
1997 occurred in an active, bullish gilts market as downward
pressure on money market rates remained intact, with the
bellwether three-month interbank rate down 1/8 point at
10-9-7/8 pct.
     It coincided with another strong sterling rally which
pushed the pound to four-year highs against the dollar.
    "That government stock disappeared very quickly indeed," said
Stephen Lewis, head of economic research at stockbrokers
Phillips and Drew; "It is an indication that the market believes
rates are going to fall further ... At least by a half-point
immediately after the budget (on March 17), and some people
hope for more."
    Stockbrokers James Capel said in a comment the move by the
National Savings Department was "of considerable significance."
    It said, "the real message ... Is that the decks are being
quickly cleared so as to facilitate a speedy decision by the
building societies to cut their rates when the inevitable cut
in bank base rates to 10 pct materialises."
    Building societies have said a drop in bank base rates
would normally have to exceed half a point to give rise to a
reduction in mortgage lending rates.
    Lewis of Phillips and Drew said he too believed the
National Savings issue suspension may reflect new U.K. Treasury
policy to point building societies towards a mortgage rate cut.
    "National Savings has been competing too effectively with
the building societies of late. Building society income has
been depressed in recent months," he said.
    He and other analysts said Chancellor of the Exchequer
Nigel Lawson was keen to see mortgage rates fall to keep a lid
on U.K. Inflation.
    Underlying upward pressure on prices is stronger in Britain
than in most other Western economies with inflation seen rising
well above four pct this year and above five pct in 1988 after
last year's 3.7 pct.
    Emphasising the impact of mortgage rates on consumer
prices, Lewis said a one-point cut in building society rates
would reduce inflation in Britain by about 0.4 pct.
    But Lewis and others noted that building societies had been
complaining to the government about intense competition from
National Savings, which they argued reduced the scope for early
mortgage rate cuts.
    "The Chancellor need not be worried about losing some PSBR
funding from National Savings, but he must be taking the
building societies' criticism to heart. It looks like the
National Savings move reflects this," one senior dealer said.
    A Savings Department spokesman refused to comment on this
interpretation, saying the suspension of the issue was merely a
reaction to the recent fall in U.K. Interest rates, which had
pushed yields on national savings bonds way out of line with
the rest of the market.
    "We are not politically motivated ... Funding was just
becoming too expensive and we don't need all that money," he
told Reuters, adding the department had suspended issues at
least twice in the past, when offered interest rates were above
or below market rates.
    He said demand for the issue had risen sharply of late as
U.K. Money market rates continued their steady decline and
income was threatening to overshoot an unofficial three billion
stg target set for fiscal 1986 ending March 31.
    In the first 10 months of fiscal 1986, National Saving's
contribution to government funding totalled 2.72 billion stg,
compared with 2.01 billion stg in the same period of the
previous year, official figures show.
    Figures for February, out on Monday, are expected to show a
further increase of between 300 and 400 mln stg, pushing the
total for 11 months above target, government officials said.

unlikely to hold any surprises that will shake U.S. interest
rate futures out of their relatively narrow trading range of
the last 3-1/2 months, financial analysts said.
    "People don't seem to have any firm conviction about the
current strength of the economy or about the Federal Reserve
doing anything," said Drexel Burnham Lambert analyst Norman
Mains.
    The narrow range trading is also taking its toll on trading
volume, he noted. "We've had a decline in activity as recent
economic statistics have not greatly changed people's
viewpoints on interest rates," Mains said.
    The data, which has provided not clear-cut view of the
economy, coupled with dampened activity in the foreign exchange
markets after the Paris initiative has made for "less than
ebullient market action," Mains said.
    He added, however, that Treasury bond futures could be in
for a retracement after the recent rise as they are near the
top of the trading range.
    "My view is that the economy remains relatively strong and
market participants will see that current prices are
unjustified," Mains said.
    Refco Inc senior vice president Michael Connery also noted
that the market is showing very little momentum and lacks
retail interest. "All of the movement occurs at the opening,"
afterwhich volume dwindles and momentum fades, Connery said.
    Although data during the week was mildly positive for bond
prices, the small rise in February producer prices and downward
revisions in January retail sales and industrial production
were "not real exciting," said Prudential Bache analyst Fred
Leiner.
    "There is no one factor that will push us through the highs
at this moment," Leiner said.
    Next week's revision to fourth quarter U.S. Gross national
Product is also likely to be of little interest to the market,
said Kleinwort Benson chief financial economist Sam Kahan.
Still, forecasts for first quarter GNP could play a role in the
direction of bond prices over the next month.
    Kahan said his early estimate for first quarter growth is
around three pct, due largely to a buildup in inventories
reflected in the January inventory data Friday, which showed
the largest increase since 1979.
    "The key question will be not whether there is a large
increase in first quarter GNP, but whether any increase is
sustainable or a one shot deal," Kahan said.
    He said that a sizable increase in first quarter GNP
stemming from an increase in inventories will be a drag on
second quarter growth.
    If that is the case, GNP in the second quarter could ease
back to a one to two pct growth rate, Kahan said.

expected to rise 26 pct to 99.9 billion pesos this year from
79.1 billion in 1986, Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin said.
    In a report to President Corazon Aquino on his department's
performance during the year ended February 28, Ongpin said at
least 15.9 billion pesos were expected to accrue from new tax
reform measures announced last year.
    He said the goal for official development assistance (ODA)
this year is two billion dlrs, adding that aid donors have
committed ODA inflows of 1.7 billion dlrs in 1987, up 30 pct
from 1.3 billion in 1986.
    Ongpin said steps planned to provide a sound revenue base
included a value added tax (VAT) system due to be introduced in
1988. He gave no other details.
    He said treasury bill maturities, interest rate levels and
the volume of government securities sold to the private sector
have improved significantly. "In particular, short-term prime
interest rates which had gone over 40 pct in 1985, are now down
to less than 10 pct," he said.
    Ongpin said the government's debt-equity scheme, introduced
in August last year, had attracted more than 276 mln dlrs worth
of applications, but selective evaluation had resulted in
approvals of only 61.8 mln dlrs at end-February.
    He said his department aims to accelerate its privatisation
program and the sale of non-performing assets owned by
associates of former President Ferdinand Marcos to achieve a
1987 sales target of four billion pesos which would help
finance land reform.
    Aquino said earlier this month that all the 24 billion
pesos the government hopes to raise from the sale of the failed
companies will be used to finance the land reform plan.
    Ongpin also said the government would pursue efforts to
obtain 500 mln dlrs in concessional funding for the program
from a World Bank-led consultative group of multilateral and
bilateral aid donors.
    The government has said the land reform plan aims to

    Bootle said the money markets had almost entirely
discounted such a one point cut, with the key three month
interbank rate down to 9-11/16 pct from 9-13/16 last night, and
it would be rather conservative for banks to go for a
half-point cut now.
    Midland Bank treasury economist David Simmonds said he,
too, expected base rates would be a full point lower by Friday,
but this would likely happen via two half-point cuts.
    "This budget is designed to please both the markets and the
electorate. The implications for interest rates are very
favourable, we could have a half-point cut tomrorow and another
such cut before the end of the week," Simmonds said.
    Pointing to buoyant U.K. Retail data released yesterday, he
said Lawson had done well to resist pressures for a sharp cut
in income tax rates at the expense of a lower borrowing target.
"There is no real need to boost private consumption," he said.
    National Westminster Bank chief economist David Kern said
the lower borrowing target set in the budget had increased the
likelihood of an early one-point base rate cut.
    Kern said the budget would have to be analysed carefully,
in particular to see how exactly Lawson planned to achieve the
sharper than expected borrowing target cut, before a one-point
base rate cut could be implemented.
 But providing the budget small-print was convincing, "and I
suspect it will be, it is entirely possible that we see one
point off base rates by the end of this week," Kern said.
    Bootle of Lloyds said the expected base rate cut would pave
the way for an early one-point cut in mortgage lending rates.
This would help achieve Lawson's lower than expected consumer
price inflation target of four pct at end-1987, he said.
    U.K. Base rates were cut last week to 10-1/2 pct from 11
pct after sustained pressure from the foreign exchange, money
and government bonds (gilts) markets.
    But building societies said they would not cut lending
rates until base rates had fallen by one full point.

are expected to meet tomorrow to seek agreement on cutting
interest rates, banking sources said.
    They said they expect Thai banks to opt for a cut to spur
domestic loan demand to help reduce persistent high liquidity
on the money market.
    Many bankers have been urging an average half percentage
point cut in deposit rates and a one point cut in lending
rates, they said.
    Six major Thai major banks reduced minimum loan and
overdraft rates by 0.50 to 0.75 percentage point on February 16
but the move has not substantially increased loan demand, the
sources said.
    Excess liquidity has been hitting bank profits since early
last year despite five interest rate cuts in 1986. The current
gross 7.25 pct interest rate for one-year fixed bank deposit
and the 11.5 pct minimum loan rate are the lowest in a decade.
    Bankers said the Thai banking system is saddled with about
40 to 50 billion baht of surplus funds which have created
problems for many banks in managing their money effectively.
    Profits of many Thai banks fell sharply last year partly
because of a mismatch of loan demand and bank deposit growth.
The Bank of Thailand estimated overall lending by the Thai
banking system grew 3.8 pct in 1986 against a 12 pct expansion
in bank deposits.
    Reports of a possible new round of interest rate cuts have
further buoyed the Thai stock market this week.
    The Securities Exchange of Thailand (SET) Index on Monday
recorded its biggest daily advance in recent years, shooting up
4.57 points to a new seven-year high of 223.02.
    Brokers and market analysts said Thai stocks will register
more gains as long as liquidity remains in the money market.
    Thai and foreign bankers said the liquidity problem will
grow if the Bank of Thailand does not extend permission for
local banks to hold foreign exchange positions up to 40 pct of
bank capital.
    If the regulation is not extended beyond its April 3 expiry
date, many commercial banks will have to reduce foreign
exchange holdings to a maximum 20 pct.
    Bankers said such that could add another five billion baht
of surplus funds to the local money market.

cautiously cutting key savings and lending rates, banking
sources said. The cuts follow nearly two months after the
Bundesbank reduced leading interest rates, far longer than the
usual interim period.
    A Deutsche Bank AG <DBKG.F> spokesman said it is cutting
leading savings rate for private customers on a regional basis
by 0.5 percentage points to two pct. Dresdner Bank AG <DRSD.F>
and Commerzbank AG <CBKG.F> have initiated similar moves. Bank
fuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG <BKFG.F> cut rates 0.5 pct generally.
    The delay was partly due to commercial banks' desire to
gauge customer reaction to a similar move by regional savings
banks.
    A fall in customer savings because of lower rates could
reduce cheap refinancing available to banks, forcing them to
draw down relatively expensive funds from other sources, one
economist at the German Banking Association said.
    But the volume of savings funds may not be substantially
undercut by lower savings rates because many customers are
parking funds in savings accounts in the hope they can reinvest
them at higher yields in the future, he said.
    He said this may conflict with Bundesbank aims to move more
funds from relatively short-term deposits to longer-dated
securities to reduce strong growth in its central bank money
supply aggregate.
    The aggregate showed annualized growth of a provisional 7.5
pct in February against the fourth quarter of last year,
unchanged from January. The growth rate was outside the
expanded target range of three to six pct.
    Few banks have so far reduced lending rates to private
customers, though lending rates for corporate customers are
beginning to decline.

that U.S. interest rate futures will break out of their narrow
ranges and low volatility during the remainder of the week.
    "We got a little volatility Wednesday," said Staley
Commodities International analyst Jerome Lacey. "But for the
moment we're still in a trading range."
    Even unexpected developments concerning the growth of the
U.S. economy may not be enough to spur the market out of its
sluggish state, the analysts said.
    "It (the bond market) has not yet demonstrated that it can
break out of its very low volatility," said Carroll McEntee and
McGinley analyst Denis Karnosky. "It needs something, but it's
not going to be news about the economy," he said.
    Karnosky said that the bond market will possibly break out
of the doldrums if participants perceive that the dollar has
stabilized and the Federal Reserve has more room to conduct
monetary policy.
    But even Wednesday, when fed funds were below six pct, the
dollar strong and oil on the soft side, bond futures attracted
eager sellers when contracts approached recent highs, he said.
    In addition to a changing perception about the dollar and
monetary policy, Golden Gate Futures president Norman Quinn
said the beginning of April could bring foreign investors back
into the marketplace.
    "The market is beginning to feel there may be demand at the
beginning of the fiscal year in Japan on April 1," Quinn said.
    Quinn echoed the sentiment of many analysts that there are
large amounts of cash waiting to be invested. If Japanese
investment in U.S. securities does materialize at the start of
Japan's fiscal year, domestic funds may also flow into the bond
market, he said.
    "We could get a stiff rally, possibly enough to bring
yields on long bonds down to seven to 7-1/8 pct," compared to
the current yield of about 7.5 pct, Quinn said.
    In the meantime, even the prospect of new supply is not
likely to move futures.
    The Treasury's announcement of a 15 billion dlr refunding
operation did little to move cash government securities prices
late Wednesday after the close of futures.
    "I'd be surprised if supply pushed us out of it (the
trading range)," Lacey said.

 ]]></BODY><BODY><![CDATA[The Association of German Cooperative
Banks said in a financial survey that domestic interest rates
would continue to remain low for the time being.
    It said the Bundesbank could hold them down despite strong
foreign influence and it saw no interest-straining factors in
the economy that could affect the long-term capital market.
    The inflation rate of one pct also gave no occasion for
higher nominal interest rates. But a probable rise in inflation
late this year could give very slight grounds for a rise in
nominal rates at year's end and next year, it said.
    The association said generally low interest rates,
prospects of lower taxes, a stable dollar rate and expected
strong domestic demand led it to believe that the investment
climate would remain friendly and the economy would continue
its slow but very sure growth.
    The Bundesbank had managed successfully to keep interest
rates down on the short-term money market although its policies
had exerted little effect on the long-term capital market,
which was so important for investment financing and thus for
the course of the economy, it said.
    In view of the limits to the possibilities monetary policy
had in influencing the longer-term capital market, the
association saw little sense in wanting to boost the economy
through a short-term and expansionist monetary policy.
    On the other hand it also saw no reason for sticking
dogmatically to the money supply target for the whole of 1987.
    The association said time would show to what extent
speculative foreign money and short-term invested domestic
money would distort money supply developments. The Bundesbank
could hold down money market rates with the highly effective
instrument of sale and repurchase transactions, it said.

over the next few months if recent efforts to stabilize
exchange rates, as seen in last month's Paris pact, extend to
keeping down European interest rates, banking economists said.
    But in the longer term domestic yields could rise under
agreements to stimulate West Germany's economy, they said.
    The Paris agreement has so far successfully stabilized
currencies with the threat of central bank intervention,
economists said.
    Economists speculated that G-7 countries may try to bolster
the pact by uncoupling U.S. and West German interest rates
further when they meet for the IMF Interim Committee in April.
"The recent round of monetary accommodation by the Bundesbank
and the Bank of Japan and the firming of the Federal Funds rate
are significant. They mark an uncoupling of movements in U.S.
and foreign interest rates," Salomon Bros Inc said in a recent
study.
    It said narrowing of international interest rate spreads
was a major factor in the dollar's fall. These spreads will
have to be widened if the dollar is to be stabilized.
    West German Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl encouraged
the U.S. not to cut interest rates in January when the
Bundesbank cut its own rates by half a point, to avoid
weakening the dollar.
    West German economists see room for further cuts in leading
West German rates if the dollar resumes its decline.
    "It's not a taboo," Peter Pietsch, spokesman for Commerzbank
AG said.
    But most economists see room for a cut in West German rates
only in the first half of the year, as re-emerging inflation
will limit room for manoeuvre later in the year.
    The Bundesbank's average yield of public paper is already
nearing last year's low. Last week, yields fell to around 5.50
pct, not far from the 1986 low of 5.35 pct posted in mid-April.
 Economists said the trend may cause domestic investors to
shift some funds from short to longer-term paper. Such a move
would tend to flatten the yield curve between short and
long-term rates, which has become more pronounced since the
Bundesbank lowered its discount rate.
    It might also facilitate a further cut in leading rates, as
the shift out of savings accounts into securities would slow
growth of the Bundesbank's central bank money stock aggregate.
    But conflicting with this trend are plans to increase West
German tax cuts, part of the Paris currency pact designed to
meet U.S. demands for faster West German growth. This move may
force interest rates up by creating a revenue vacuum which must
be filled by higher government borrowing.
    This may not occur if private sector demand for credit
remains weak, but demand could emerge if rates begin rising.
    Economists said it appeared the government had already
stepped up borrowing this year to accomodate revenue loss from
other sources, including tax losses resulting from weaker than
expected economic growth, and higher than expected spending.
    Josef Koerner, chief economist of the West German
Ifo-Institut, said in a newspaper interview he expected 1987
tax revenue to be some 11 billion marks below estimates by the
West German government in November.
    Any tax shortfall in itself is unlikely to push yields up.
But coupled with other factors such as waning foreign
speculative buying of mark bonds on the dollar's decline, long
term yields may to have to rise, economists said.
    Public authority borrowing in 1988 may also rise owing to
increases in the second phase of Bonn's tax reform package.
    The West German government is raising its total tax cuts in
1988 by 5.2 billion marks to 14.4 billion.
    West German chancellor Helmut Kohl said last week increased
borrowing to finance the tax reform is acceptable.
    Finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said last Thursday he
was looking for other ways to finance the reform, such as
raising indirect taxes.
    But few economists believe the government will be able to
go through with its tax measures without increasing net
borrowing.
    The Bundesbank said in its February report that it was
wrong to believe that the first stage of the tax reform in 1986
could be managed without increasing deficits.
    The Bundesbank said West German public authorities borrowed
a large 21.9 billion marks in credit markets in the 1986 final
quarter compared with 14.8 billion in fourth quarter 1985.
    The federal government took up nearly 10 billion marks of
the fourth quarter 1986 figures, and also drew on two billion
marks of Bundesbank advances at the end of the year, when it
had not required such a credit in the 1985 quarter.

Chase, sent U.S. bond prices lower and the dollar higher.
    McCulley said that once the spread between three-month
certificates of deposit and the prime rate narrows to less than
1-1/2 percentage points, there is a strong chance of a prime
rate increase. It has been under 1-1/4 points recently.
    However, banks are likely to hold rate increases until they
see what the Fed intends to do about interest rates in the near
term, analysts said. They noted that banks historically like to
follow Fed rate movements, rather than lead them. For example,
the last prime rate increase occurred in June 1984 when banks
lifted the rate to 13 pct from 12-1/2 pct after a Fed discount
rate increase in April of that year.
    Major banks had been posting a 7-1/2 pct prime rate since
last August 26/27, when they lowered the rate from eight pct
shortly after the Fed's half-point discount rate cut to the
current 5-1/2 pct level on August 20.
    "The banks will not rush to raise their prime rates. There
should be a split prime for a while with some posting a 7-1/2
pct rate and others 7-3/4 pct," said David Jones of Aubrey G.
Lanston and Co.
    Jones said the Federal Open Market Committee at today's
meeting voted no change in Fed policy. But he said the Fed may
well foster higher interest rates soon.
    Jones said that, while the FOMC probably voted no policy
change today, it may have decided to apply slight upward rate
pressure later if the dollar weakens, inflation pressures heat
up or the economy shows sign of strong recovery.
    "The Fed clearly indicated that they did not intend to
tighten policy when they did today's coupon pass," said Joseph
Liro of S.G. Warburg and Co.
    In a move that came a day earlier than most expected, the
Fed today supplied permanent reserves to the banking system by
offering to buy all maturities of Treasury notes and bonds for
its own account. This seasonal reserve add is called a "pass."
    "The Fed demonstrated that there has been no policy
change," said Elizabeth Reiners, economist at Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. 
    She said the spread between banks' cost of funds and the
prime rate is now around 137 basis points compared with a 153
basis point average in 1986. Reiners said the spread is not
really narrow enough to present a clear need for a prime rate
increase.
    The Dean Witter economist said that today's prime rate rise
"may have been less a response to interest rates than an
attempt to enhance the (balance sheet) bottom line."
    Reiners said that, given recent problems with loans to
developing countries, large money center banks with heavy
exposures might be the first to match the higher prime rate in
an effort to get more profitable spreads on other loans.
    The Federal funds rate at which banks lend overnight money
to one another could help determine how many banks match the
higher prime rate and also how quickly they move.
    In raising their prime rates, banks cited a higher cost of
funds. In the three business days through Monday, the Federal
funds rate at which banks lend to one another averaged nearly
6-1/4 pct. But quarter end pressures helped push up funds.  
    The Fed funds rate was extremely volatile today, reflecting
demand pressure associated with the end of the quarter and the
close of the Japanese fiscal year. Funds traded between five
and 6-3/4 pct.
    Once the special distortions end, analysts said the funds
rate probably will return to its recent trading level in the
6-1/8 pct area. They said that, if it stabilizes near there,
banks may not quickly boost their prime rates.
    But a consistently higher funds rates would suggest to many
that the Fed was fostering somewhat higher interest rates to
help the dollar. Then banks would lift prime rates quickly.

prime rates by half a percentage point to 6-1/2 pct following a
one-quarter point prime rate increase by two major U.S. Banks
yesterday, dealers said.
    They told Reuters local banks may decide on the increase at
this weekend's routine meeting of the Hong Kong Association of
Banks.
    G.C. Goh, chief dealer of the Standard Chartered Bank, said
prime rate increases by Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank to
7-3/4 pct from 7-1/2 may prompt Hong Kong banks to follow suit.
    Goh said local banks want to restore the prime to 6-1/2
pct, the level at beginning of 1987.
    The banks raised the prime to the current six pct from five
pct on February 28 after cutting it 1-1/2 points from 6-1/2 on
January 15 in response to upside pressure on the Hong Kong
dollar, he said.
    The medium and longer term interbank rates firmed today,
with three months ending at 5-1/16 to 4-7/8 pct against
yesterday's five to 4-13/16 close. The overnight rate, however,
fell to 3-1/2 to three pct from 4-1/2 to four because of
increased liquidity for a local stock issue.

 ]]></BODY><BODY><![CDATA[The Indian Finance Ministry's
announcement in Parliament yesterday, changing the nation's
interest rate structure, will benefit industry and agriculture
by providing loans at lower interest, bankers and brokers said.
    The changes, effective today, included reducing commercial
bank lending rates that have ranged between 15 pct and 17.5 pct
by one percentage point.
    New rates, which affect both Indian and foreign banks, also
include a one percentage point gain, to an annual 10 pct, on
deposits of two years or more but less than five.
    Bank deposits of five years or more carrying 11 pct
interest have been abolished.
    Bankers said the interest rate modifications reflect the
government's concern to reduce the costs of borrowing and help
improve world competitiveness of Indian goods.
    There is likely to be a shift to short-term bank deposits
by long-term depositors, bankers predicted. This will create
the flexibility to draw and re-invest funds in either equity
shares or short-term bank deposits, they said.
    A merchant banker also said reduced manufacturing costs due
to lower lending rates are likely to boost the share market.
    Tata Steel, a trend setter on the Bombay Stock Exchange,
opened today higher at 1,040 rupees against yesterday's closing
of 1,012.50 rupees.
    A stockbroker said investors may be less enthusiastic now
to buy convertible and non-convertible debentures because the
Finance Ministry has reduced the annual interest rate to 12.5
pct and 14 pct respectively from 13.5 and 15 pct respectively.
    "But overall debenture prospects remain bright because the
rates of interest on them will still be higher than what banks
pay for deposits of similar maturity," a merchant banker said.

follow industry leaders Citibank and Chase Manhattan in raising
their prime rate is likely to cast a pall over the credit
markets today, economists said.
    Bond prices had been making a smart recovery from two days
of heavy selling when Citibank surprised the market by
announcing a quarter-point increase in its prime rate to 7-3/4
pct. Chase Manhattan quickly followed.
    Prices quickly fell by a full point, even though the dollar
- the market's overriding concern of late - rose sharply on the
news.
    Citibank cited the higher cost of money, especially in the
Euromarket, as the reason for raising its prime rate.
    Part of this rise in market rates has been caused by fears
of a tighter Federal Reserve policy to defend the dollar, but
economists said it is too early to tell whether the Fed, whose
policy-making federal open market committee, FOMC, meets this
week, is already tightening its grip on credit.
    "The Fed seems to have been a bit slow in meeting the
banking system's reserve needs this statement period, but I
wouldn't conclude anything until I've seen the Fed data," said
Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank.

rates have grown in recent days but bank chiefs are divided
over the issue.
    Karl Vak, General Director of the Zentralsparkasse und
Kommerzialbank, Wien, called today for a cut of up to half a
percentage point in interest rates across the board. But Hannes
Androsch, head of Creditanstalt-Bankverein <CABV.VI> told
Reuters he opposed a cut because it would hurt small savers.
    Vak told a news conference that last January's cut in
lending rates for commercial customers and for all depositors
by a quarter point had been insufficient.
    The January cut followed the National Bank's lowering of
its discount and Lombard rates by half a point in line with a
similar Bundesbank move. Prime lending rate is now 8.75 pct and
deposit rates vary between 3.25 and 5.75 pct.
    Yesterday Hellmuth Klauhs, head of the Genossenschaftliche
Zentralbank AG, said rates could fall at least a quarter of a
point, or even half a point if German rates dropped further.
    Vak noted that inflation had fallen below one pct. A
widening gap between Austrian rates and cheaper West German
credit along with forecasts of slow Austrian economic growth
this year also justified a further interest drop, he said.
    Karl Pale, head of Girozentrale und Bank der
oesterreichischen Sparkassen AG [GIRV.VI] has also called for
lower deposit rates but said lending rates should remain
unchanged at the moment. Interest margins were too small,
particularly when compared with other West European countries.
    But Hans Haumer, head of the Erste Oesterreichische
Spar-Casse-Bank told Reuters that no cut should be made unless
West German rates came down first.
    Banking sources said no bank seemed ready to lower rates
alone and supporters of a cut would have difficulty overcoming
opposition from Creditanstalt, Austria's biggest bank.

 ]]></BODY><BODY><![CDATA[There is little scope for a substantial
increase in U.S. interest rates during 1987, said Federal
National Mortgage Association chairman David Maxwell.
    Speaking to the New York Financial Writers' Association,
Maxwell said he viewed this week's rise in U.S. banks' prime 
rates to 7-3/4 pct from 7-1/2 pct as a temporary phenomenon.
    "I don't see a substantial rise in rates this year. If
anything, the Federal Reserve is more likely to ease than to
tighten (monetary policy) because so many sectors of the
economy are showing weakness," Maxwell said. Fannie Mae buys
mortgages from lenders and issues mortgage-backed securities.
    Maxwell said restructuring of Fannie Mae over the last two
years had limited its exposure to interest rate fluctuations. A
one pct rise in rates in 1987 would cost shareholders about 18
cts a share versus one dlr a share in 1981, he said.
    Maxwell also questioned the view that housing crowds out
other sectors of the economy from obtaining needed capital.
    "There's no evidence that housing is crowding firms out of
the long-term debt market," he said. Both home mortgage debt
and long-term corporate debt grew at about equal annual rates
of about 13 pct in 1986 -- a year when mortgage originations of
442 billion dlrs needed record housing capital, he said.

rates on one, two and three-month treasury certificates to 7.30
pct from 7.40 pct effective immediately, the bank said in a

    The Bank last adjusted its short-term treasury certificate

    A National Bank spokesman said the latest adjustment would

interbank interest rates.
    The spokesman said it was too early to predict whether the
move would herald a reduction in discount rate, which currently
stands at eight pct, when the Bank holds its regular weekly

interest rates this year to sustain world economic growth,
First Boston Corp managing director Albert Wojnilower said.
    As much as the Fed would like to take a tough line against
inflation, it cannot act to slow the growth of credit without
subverting national U.S. economic policy.
    "On selected occasions when the dollar seems steady, and,
because the trade deficit is not responding, the United States
decided to push Germany and Japan harder to meet their
commitments to economic growth, the Federal Reserve will do its
part by moving rates down," Wojnilower said in a report.
    "Justifiably not anticipating either a recession or
seriously higher interest rates, securities market participants
have seen little to fear," Wojnilower said.
    He said last week's "hiccup" in money and currency rates
and bond and stock prices was probably caused by Japanese
window dressing for March 31 end-of-fiscal-year accounts.
    Wojnilower said the U.S. probably enjoyed above-average
economic growth in the first quarter. However, the pick-up
seems to reflect an unsustainable pace of inventory building
and the prospect for the full year is still for real gross
national product growth of about 2-1/2 pct, he said.

sparked renewed speculation in financial markets that a cut in
the West German three pct discount rate may be under
discussion, currency dealers said.
    Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler said in a speech that
monetary growth resulting from speculative capital inflows
required cuts in interest rates.
    Separately, West Berlin state central bank president Dieter
Hiss told journalists that the discount rate could fall below
its lowest ever point of 2.75 pct. He made clear that he was
not making a forecast on interest rates, however.
    Currency dealers here and in the Far East said the dollar
gained slight background support from the speculation.
    But German dealers noted that the Bundesbank kept the 3.80
pct rate unchanged at which it offered liquidity to the money
market this week, dashing some expectations that it may either
offer lower fixed rate money or offer a reduced minimum rate
and let the strength of banks' demands set the allocation rate.
    It allocated 6.1 billion marks in new liquidity, much less
than the 14.9 billion leaving the market as a prior pact
expired. This further weakened sentiment the Bundesbank could
move to a more accommodative monetary stance, dealers said.
    Koehler said in a speech in Surrey, England, speculative
capital inflows may cause monetary growth, regardless of
whether central banks intervened or exchange rates fell.
    "In other words, the monetary policy measures required are
different from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to --
those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of
mounting economic activity."
    Though Koehler was known to be the most liberal of the
generally monetarist Bundesbank board, his comments marked the
first time cuts in rates had been concretely suggested as a
counterpoint to overly strong monetary growth, dealers said.

the Exchequer, said some countries may need to cut interest
rates with the aim of maintaining exchange rate stability.
    Speaking to journalists one day after the Group of Seven
countries reaffirmed goals set in Paris six weeks ago, he said
central banks would continue to intervene "as and when
necessary."
    He said the G-7 countries were concerned that Japan do more
to stimulate domestic demand and welcomed measures outlined by
Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa yesterday.
    Lawson said he was still worried about  the risk of a
simultaneous recession in the United States, Japan and West
Germany, though less so than when he gave his March 17 budget
speech to the British Parliament.
    "If anything I'm a little bit less concerned, but there is
still a risk," he said.
    Asked if the United States should consider increasing
interest rates to support the dollar, he said, "If there is a
need for changes in relative interest rates, it doesn't need to
be a rise in interest rates in the United States."
    Lawson said there was some concern expressed in yesterday's
meetings at the slow progress the United States had made in
reducing its budget deficit.
    "We believe there will be some worthwhile progress in
reducing the deficit this year. The important thing is that it
continue year after year," Lawson said.
    The February 22 Louvre accord called for efforts to
stabilize currencies at then-current exchange rates. In the six
weeks that followed the Japanese yen continued to rise against
the dollar despite massive central bank intervention.
    Asked whether this intervention was a sign of weakness in
the Louvre accord, he said, "I don't think so. If there had been
no intervention you would have called that a sign of weakness."
    Although intervention could be a cause of inflation, Lawson
said, "the world does not appear to be in an inflationary mode
... but one has to be vigilant."
    He said yesterday's G-7 statement, which affirmed that
"current levels" of exchange rates were appropriate, had been
"carefully worded." "We know what we mean, and we all mean the
same thing," he said.
    Lawson said financial markets seem to believe that Japanese
measures outlined in the Louvre accord were the source of
weakness for that agreement.
    Therefore, the G-7 countries welcomed Miyazawa's
presentation of plans for a supplemental budget to stimulate
domestic demand.
    They particularly welcomed the goal of an immediate
increase in public works spending, but Lawson said the package
also involved a second stage to increase expenditures during
the second half of this year.

has no plans to cut its discount rate.
    They told reporters that there was no pressure on Japan
during the Group of Seven (G-7) meeting here yesterday to lower
its discount rate. They added that they themselves do not feel
any need for a cut at all.
    Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson told reporters
earlier today that some countries - those with strong
currencies - might have to cut interest rates.
    The Bank of Japan sources also said that it was too soon to
call the G-7 pact a failure.
    The central bank sources were commenting on the dollar's
renewed tumble in New York and Tokyo, which was sparked by
remarks by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that the
dollar's fall had been orderly.
    They said the market must have misinterpreted Baker's
comments because he was referring to the dollar's fall since
the Plaza agreement in September 1985, over a long-time span,
not the currency's recent movements.
    They added that the foreign exchange markest seem to seize
on anything to use as an excuse to drive the dollar one way or
the other.
    The Bank of Japan sources said the U.S. Is putting more
weight on the dollar/yen rate in terms of judging market
stability than on other currencies.
    Throughout the G-7 meeting, Japan pointed to the dangers
that would arise from a further dollar fall because it would
reduce the flow of Japanese capital to the U.S., Hurting the
U.S. And world economies, they said.
    In February and in March of this year, Japanese investors
reduced their purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds, the sources
said.
    Each country in the G-7 - Britain, Canada, France, Italy,
Japan, the U.S. And West Germany - has a different view about
currency stability, the Bank of Japan sources said.
    This is because the overall foreign exchange market is a
triangle of dollar/yen, European currencies/yen and
dollar/European currencies.
    At the time of the Louvre agreement, European countries did
not want the yen to weaken against their currencies so they did
not object to the yen strengthening, they said.

Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.) called on major industrial countries to
make a pledge at the coming economic summit in Venice to cut
interest rates.
    "I think at the summit meeting in Venice what we ought to be
trying to do is to get the other major industrial nations that
are involved to bring interest rates down, say, one pct,"
Bentsen told NBC Television's "Meet the Press."
    Bentsen said coordinated rate cuts could take "billions off
the debt service of the Latin countries" and help ease
protectionist pressures in the industrial countries.
    Bentsen also South Korea and Taiwan should be pressured to
revalue their currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar.
    "You take the Taiwanese, with an enormous capital surplus,
enormous trade surplus, and we've had very little cooperation
there," he said.
    Departing Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman told the
same television network he agreed that the U.S. dollar had not
fallen enough against the currencies of some countries.
    "I think that more does have to be done there in
negotiations with the countries involved, the so-called NICs
(newly industrialized countries)," he said.
    Darman said such negotiations with newly industrialized
countries were underway privately.
    Bentsen predicted Congress and the White House would agree
on a fiscal 1988 budget that would raise between 18 and 22
billion dlrs in new revenues.
    The Texas senator said a series of excise taxes would be
considered by Congress, including an extension of the telephone
tax and new levies on liquor and cigarettes.
    Bentsen said he supported an oil import fee, but that it
would not happen without President Reagan's support.
    Darman called for a "top level negotiation" between the White
House and Congress on a budget compromise that would include
asset sales, some excise taxes, cuts in middle-class
entitlement programs, "a reasonable, steady rate of growth in
defense" and reform of the budget process.

Miller said he was concerned that the Federal Reserve might
"overreact" to the decline in the value of the U.S. dollar by
raising interest rates, a move he said could cause a recession
next year.
    "Our greatest danger is overreaction," Miller told newspaper
reporters yesterday. "I'm concerned about the Fed's
overreaction. I'm concerned about what I see in recent data
showing a substantial fall in the money supply."
    Edwin Dale, Miller's spokesman, said the remarks, published
in the New York Times today, were accurate.
    Miller said he was concerned the Fed might overreact to
signals of rising inflation by tightening credit -- a move he
said could have "political consequences."
    The White House budget chief appeared to be referring to
the effect an economic slowdown could have on the presidential
and congressional elections next year.
    "My fear is that if we get into a recession we are in deep
soup, and there is no question about it," he said.
    Miller said an economic slowdown could lead to lower tax
revenues and a widening of the budget deficit.
    Miller's remarks reflected concern that the U.S. central
bank might feel compelled to tighten credit as a means of
bolstering the dollar.
    Both Treasury Secretary James Baker and Federal Reserve
Board Chairman Paul Volcker recently have warned that further
declines in the value of the U.S. dollar could jeopardize
global growth prospects.
    U.S. officials have urged Japan and West Germany to
stimulate economic growth in their countries -- a move that
could boost U.S. exports and relieve trade protectionist
pressures in the United States.

are meeting here today to consider a new plan for reducing the
cost of financing British exports guaranteed by the Export
Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD), senior banking sources
said.
    The plan is being developed in conjunction with the ECGD
and the Bank of England.
    Neither the ECGD nor the Bank of England would comment on
the plan. However, bankers said one of the main points under
discussion is a plan to refinance the bulk of the ECGD's medium
term credit portfolio in the international capital markets.

    The proposals involve introducing a set of interest margins
on ECGD backed debt of 5/16 to 7/8 pct, depending on the size
and maturity of the credit and the currency.
    The banks are likely to push for a higher margin. Bankers
said that while these rates would reduce a bank's return they
would still be more than those proposed about a year ago when
the government attempted unsuccessfully to initiate another
cost reduction plan.
    At the same time, the banks would be expected to allow the
ECGD to realise additional savings by refinancing existing
government backed credit in the capital markets.

    On credits that are refinanced an original lender would
receive a residual margin of 7/16 pct for loans up to 10 mln
stg and 3/16 pct on larger transactions.

    But in the early 1980s interest rates soared. U.S. Lenders,
mostly savings and loan associations, were earning rates as low
as three pct on 30 year fixed rate mortgages they held in their
portfolios but had to pay depositors rates as high as 15 pct to
induce them to retain their accounts.
    As a result hundreds of institutions collapsed or were
forced to merge. The survivors decided to offer mortgages whose
rates would move in line with the cost of funds.
    "We very much have the example of the U.S. Thrifts in mind,"
said a spokesman for Abbey National Building Society,
explaining why his institution, for the time being, is only
offering variable rate mortgages.
    The rash of advertising to solicit new business has helped
homebuyers to become even choosier about loans and lenders
concede they are being forced to undercut each other still
more.
    Sharp cuts on variable rate mortgages announced earlier
this week by the nation's two largest building societies and by
National Westminster Bank Plc reflect growing competition for
new business, officials at all three institutions said.
    The fixed rate mortgages on offer carry interest rates even
below those on the variable rate loans.
    "Of course they are less profitable than other (variable
rate) mortgages," said a spokesman for Midland Bank Plc, which
earlier this year said it earmarked 500 mln dlrs for fixed rate
new mortgage loans.
    But he said the bank is willing to offer less profitable
loans because, "It was just another way to attract people to our
mortgage product."
    Trustee Savings Bank Plc (TSB) was offering five year fixed
rate mortgages at 9.9 pct earlier this year.
    The 100 mln stg that TSB set aside for the loans was
exhausted within just a few days, according to a spokeswoman.
    "Everybody loves an under 10 pct mortgage," she said, noting
that within five days the bank loaned the equivalent of 25 pct
of its 1986 volume.
    In short, the appeal of fixed rate mortgages is that they
offer an opportunity to gamble on the direction of interest
rates. If interest rates fall after the mortgage is made the
lender is earning an above average return on assets.
    But if interest rates rise it is the homebuyer who has won
the benefit of cheap money.
    Household Mortgage Co had planned to offer a 25 year fixed
rate mortgage after the June 11 elections on the assumption
that a Conservative Party victory would help money market rates
fall further, according to Duncan Young, managing director.
    Young explained that the company had planned to protect
itself against the chance of rising interest rates by buying a
complicated hedging instrument.
    But money market rates have risen contrary to expectations
and the company has shelved its plans for the time being. He
said money market rates were too high to arrange both the
mortgages and hedge profitably.
    However, he said that when the Household Mortgage Co does
make fixed rate mortgages it is likely to securitise them. This
means bundling different mortgages together to resemble a bond
and selling them to an investor.
    For technical reasons securitisation is simpler and more
efficient with fixed rate rather than with floating rate
mortgages. In the U.S., Where fixed rate mortgages are popular
again, securitisation has provided the bulk of mortgage money
over the past few years.

month in U.S. debt futures may be extended next week by a
series of U.S. economic reports, analysts said, as long as the
dollar holds firm.
    "Interest rates have declined by approximately 50 basis
points over the last month, largely over indications that
inflation is not as high as people had feared and the narrowing
U.S. trade balance, in nominal terms," Samuel Kahan, chief
financial economist with Kleinwort Benson Government
Securities, said.
    Kahan said recent government reports have shown strength in
the economy during the first quarter, but his concern is
whether the U.S. economy will sustain that strength in the
longer term.
    Weak U.S. economic growth could hurt the dollar, which has
become more important to the direction of debt futures than the
beneficial impact on interest rates of a sluggish economy.
    The median trade expectations for Tuesday's U.S. Consumer
Price Index and Durable Goods reports are up 0.4 pct and down
1.5 pct, respectively.
    Meanwhile, the eight billion dlr drop in the M-1 money
supply announced this week was "surprising, much larger than
expected," according to Kahan. "Unless quickly reversed," such
a trend "will ensure that June M-1 growth will be negative,"
Kahan said.
    Taken in conjunction with M-2 and M-3 aggregates which
Kahan said have "slowed to a crawl, below Federal Reserve Board
annual targets," the consequences could be a hint of economic
weakness down the road, he said.
    Based on chart formations, T-bond futures may be poised for
further gains, although the advance has been slowed recently,
analysts said.
    September T-bonds "are up almost six points since about May
18," Merrill Lynch debt analyst Jim Duggan noted. September
bond futures climbed from the low of 87 a month ago to over 93
in mid-June, Duggan said.
    While follow-through buying has aided the advance so far,
and bouts of short covering have prohibited a slide through
chart support, the rally in September T-bonds has been thwarted
above the 93 level.
    "The 93 level is formidable resistance and must be taken
out before this activity is anything other than a trading range
market," Carroll McEntee and McGinley Futures debt analyst
Brian Singer said.
    The dollar remains the key fundamental factor, and the U.S.
currency has made little headway of late, analysts said.
    "The critical variable remaining in the market is the value
of the dollar," Kahan said.
    Additional influences next week will be possible
developments ahead of an OPEC members meeting, and the impact
and size of the U.S. budget deficit, "although these will not
be in the forefront of the market early next week," Kahan said.
    In looking ahead to the U.S. Treasury mini-refunding
auctions of 24.25 billion in T-notes on Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday, Singer said the market will likely greet the results
with little excitement. However, a successful auction could
prove to be a turning point, depending on prevailing market
psychology.

in certificates of deposit (CDs) via repurchase agreements
today to show its determination to maintain an easy money
policy, central bank officials said.
    "Today's CD buying operation was designed to seek an
announcement effect, in which we would reassure the market of
the fact that we have not changed our policy stance," a senior
central bank official told Reuters.
    The bank also bought 400 billion yen in two-month
commercial bills to smooth out tight credit conditions in the
interbank market today, the officials said.
    The central bank was concerned about growing market
expectations of higher interest rates, which were in part
responsible for the recent plunge in stock and yen bond prices,
the officials said.
    But money traders said the market generally shrugged off
the bank's CD operation because it was small and at a rate far
below prevailing market rates. The rate on the key three-month
CDs in the primary market was 4.08/00 pct, while the bank's bid
was 3.75 pct, they said.
    The bank's bill buying operation also had little impact
because it was regarded as a routine operation, they said.
    The money traders said they regarded the central bank's CD
buying operation as simply a gesture to live up to Japan's
pledge to guide interest rates lower and stimulate the economy.
    "We did not expect the central bank to ease its credit grip
any further," a bank manager said, adding that the prevailing
market expectation of higher rates will remain.
    "If this is the case, the three-month CD rate will stay
above four pct for the time being," he said.

West Germany would be badly advised to lower interest rates and
that he believed the economy would continue to recover after a
six-month lull.
    Asked by the newspaper Bild am Sonntag if lower interest
rates could boost the domestic economy, Poehl said: "We would be
badly advised if we forced further interest rate cuts.
    "This could, under certain circumstances, release new
inflationary fears which would then be more likely to lead to
higher interest rates," he added.

    Poehl said Germany had practically no growth in the past
six months because of the mark's surge and the cold winter.
    "But since April, statistics clearly show that the economy
finds itself on a course of growth," he said. "I expect this
development to continue in the coming months."
    Asked about his expectations of a U.S.-European Community
trade war, Poehl said such an event would be disastrous.
    "For this reason we in Europe must avoid everything used by
protectionist forces in the U.S. As pretexts," he added. "This
includes...Eliminating existing restrictions in the EC as far
as possible. Protectionism is not found only in the U.S."

notified the Netherlands that it was terminating the 1948
income tax treaty as it applies to the Netherlands Antilles and
Aruba.
    The termination is effective January 1, 1988, the Treasury
said in a two-sentence announcement.
    The Treasury decided to end the treaty after negotiations
between the United States and the Netherlands over the past
eight years had failed to reach an accord, a Treasury spokesman
said.
    The decision means the sale by U.S. parent companies of
Eurobonds through Netherlands Antilles subsidiaries will no
longer be free of the 30 pct U.S. withholding tax, the
spokesman said.
    Terminating the tax treaty with the Netherlands Antilles 
may cause bond issuers to call in the bonds early. Most have
maturities of 10 years or less and were issued before 1984, the
spokesman said.
    He said the Treasury did not expect the action to have an
adverse effect on U.S. issuers of the bonds because the general
decline in interest rates means they will be able to refinance
at lower interest rates.
    However, the holders of the bonds presumably will be faced
with lower yields.

interest rates are a cause for concern and the Bundesbank has
no interest in higher capital market rates, Bundesbank
President Karl Otto Poehl said.
    "We consider the interest rate increase that has occurred
here and internationally to be a problem and cause for concern,"
Poehl told an investment conference.
    "I would like to stress that the Bundesbank has no interest
in higher capital market rates," he said.
    Shortly after Poehl spoke, the Bundesbank announced a
tender for a securities repurchase pact at a fixed rate of 3.80
pct.
    Previous tenders over the last month by interest rate have
seen the allocation rate on these facilities rise to 3.85 pct
at last week's pact from 3.60 on the last fixed-rate tender in
late September.
    The Bundesbank's reduction of the key allocation rate to
3.80 from 3.85 pct was heralded Monday by repeated injections
of money market liquidity at between 3.70 and 3.80 pct.
    These moves to cap interest rates followed a meeting
between Poehl, Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and U.S.
Treasury Secretary James Baker Monday in Frankfurt.
    Officials said afterwards the three men had reaffirmed
their commitment to the Louvre accord on currency stability.
    Over the weekend, criticism by Baker of the tightening in
West German monetary policy had prompted a sharp fall of the
dollar on speculation that Louvre cooperation had ended.
    But the dollar rallied on news of Monday's meeting in
nervous trading to trade above 1.79 marks Tuesday.
    Poehl said that the recent rise in interest rates was not
due to central bank policy, but to markets' expectations, and
currency developments.
    Commenting on the inflationary expectations, Poehl said "You
have to get to the root of the problem, you have to pursue a
policy which reveals that there are no grounds for such fears."
 The inflationary fears were unjustified and exaggerated, he
said.
    Poehl rebuffed recent U.S. Criticism of West Germany,
saying the Bundesbank had made a substantial contribution to
international cooperation in interest and monetary policy.
    The Bundesbank has tolerated an overshooting of its money
supply target, arousing criticism from other quarters, he said.
    "Today we still have lower interest rates than at the end of
1986... Quite the contrary of other countries, where interest
rates have risen substantially more," Poehl said.
    This had to be taken into account when considering recent
rises in repurchase pact allocation rates, which were due to
rising international money market rates that had spilled over
into the German market, he said.
    Poehl expressed surprise that financial markets had so far
ignored improvements in the U.S. Deficits.
    "The adjustment process in the U.S. Trade balance is
definitely underway," he said, noting that this was not so
noticeable in absolute figures.
    The spectacular improvement in the budget deficit had also
attracted little attention, he said.

the Bank of Japan from raising its discount rate and could even
force it to ease monetary policy if the collapse continues,
government and private economists said.
    A rise in interest rates now would only serve to spark
further selling of shares that could ultimately have a major
deflationary impact on the real economy, they said.
    Although Bank of Japan officials have consistently
maintained that they had no plans to raise the 2.5 pct discount
rate, many in the markets have thought otherwise. 
    Fears of a rise in the discount rate were fanned by the
central bank's apparent decision last week to countenance
higher rates on commercial bills, dealers said.
    But today's stock market collapse -- prices fell nearly 15
pct -- means that the Bank of Japan would be hard pressed to
raise the discount rate now, despite its concerns about a
renewed outbreak of inflation, dealers and economists said.
    Japanese government bond prices rose sharply today as the
markets concluded that the stock market's collapse precluded
the central bank from carrying out the widely-rumoured discount
rate increase.
    A senior government economist suggested that both the U.S.
And Japan needed to ease monetary policy now to prevent a
further drop in New York and Tokyo stock prices. "They need to
support the stock and security markets," he said.
    But Bank of Japan officials said they saw no need to change
policy for the moment, although one admitted that the central
bank may have to rethink its strategy if Tokyo stock prices
continue to plunge during the rest of the week.
    Both government and Bank of Japan economists agreed the
economy is better placed now to cope with the deflationary
impact of plunging stock prices than it was a few months ago.
    With the economy recovering strongly, the steep drop in
stock prices is not likely to put a major dent in consumer and
business confidence, one government economist said.
    "There will be some impact on the real economy, but it won't
be that big," said another.
    Individuals are not heavily invested in stocks on their
own, although they do participate through trust funds and other
investment vehicles. And while many manufacturing firms turned
to financial market investments for profits during last year's
economic downturn, the recent rebound has allowed them to
refocus their attention on their core businesses, he said.
    Paradoxically, it is the pick-up in the economy that is
partly to blame for the stock market collapse as companies have
shifted funds away from financial investments to increase
inventories and step up capital spending, one government
economist said.
    In deciding what response to make to the steep stock price
drop, the Bank of Japan must first determine whether prices
will continue to fall further and then decide if they pose a
greater economic danger than the threat of higher inflation,
one central bank official said. "That will at least take a
couple of days, if not weeks," he said.

surge in U.K. September sterling bank lending is unlikely to
nudge the Bank of England towards tightening monetary policy as
long as sterling remains in its present robust state,
economists said.
    An acute crisis of confidence in equity markets over the
past two days will in any case subdue personal consumer credit
demand which has largely been behind growth in lending.
    "In the normal course of events the markets would have been
extremely worried about that figure," noted Peter Spencer, U.K.
Economist with Credit Suisse First Boston.
    After an initial dip in reaction to the bank lending data,
which compared won stg August rise, U.K.
Government bonds (gilts) soared as investors continued to flee
from plummetting equities into the relative security of
government securities.
    Equity markets dropped sharply on the news, touching a
day's low of 1,766.7 on the FTSE 100 index after the data,
before staging a recovery. Sterling held its buoyant tone
throughout.
    U.K. Money market rates, in a similarly calm response,
resumed the slightly easier trend of earlier in the morning
after little more than a token blip as the figures came out.
    Noting that such a huge rise in credit extended by banks
would under other circumstances have prompted market fears of a
rise in clearing bank base rates from the current 10 pct, "With
the financial markets doing what they're doing, that's the last
thing the Bank of England would want to do," Spencer said.
    "The monetary situation is clearly very bad but as long as
sterling is firm, the authorities are unlikely to put rates up,"
said Kevin Boakes, chief U.K. Economist at Greenwell Montagu
Gilt Edged. Boakes pointed to a rise in the narrow money
measure M0 to 5.2 pct year-on-year from August's 4.5 pct
growth, which he said must cause some concern at the Treasury.
    But "The fact that overall broad money growth has slowed
down is a rather encouraging sign," noted Paul Temperton, U.K.
Economist with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. He pointed to a
fall in the year-on-year growth rate of the M3 broad money
aggregate to 19.5 pct in September from August's 22 pct.
    It was concern about credit growth which prompted the Bank
of England to engineer a one point rise in U.K. Bank base rates
to 10 pct in early August, caution endorsed subsequently by
news of a massive 4.9 billion stg July rise in bank lending.
    Temperton noted that a particular focus of bank worry in
that period had been the behaviour of U.K. Asset markets.
    Housing and equities were the key two asset markets in
influencing consumer behaviour, he said.
    In the light of the precipitous falls on U.K. Equity
markets in the past few days, "There will almost certainly be a
straightforward impact on consumer spending and on retail
sales," Temperton said.
    "Almost certainly we can look forward to slower growth in
consumer borrowing if the equity shakeout continues," he added.
    "I think the stock market has decided that the bank lending
figure is a thing of the past...We are talking about a very
serious panic and a flight to quality," Spencer said.
    A U.K. Treasury official said that it was important to look
at all the monetary information, not just the bank lending,
adding that monetary aggregates were growing much more slowly
than bank lending.
    Senior banking sources noted that the surge in bank lending
was evidence of the continuing recent trend of fairly heavy
personal sector borrowing.
    Figures from the Banking Information Service showed
personal sector lending by U.K. Clearing banks rose by 1.66
billion stg in September after a 978 mln stg August rise. Much
of the rise reflected quarterly interest payments.
