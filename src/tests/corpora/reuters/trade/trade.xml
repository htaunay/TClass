plan, initially hailed at home and abroad as the saviour of the
economy, is limping towards its first anniversary amid soaring
prices, widespread shortages and a foreign payments crisis.
    Announced last February 28 the plan froze prices, fixed the
value of the new Cruzado currency and ended widespread
indexation of the economy in a bid to halt the country's 250
pct inflation rate.
    But within a year the plan has all but collapsed.
    "The situation now is worse than it was. Although there was
inflation, at least the economy worked," a leading bank
economist said.
    The crumbling of the plan has been accompanied by a
dramatic reversal in the foreign trade account. In 1984 and
1985 Brazil's annual trade surpluses had been sufficient to
cover the 12 billion dlrs needed to service its 109 billion dlr
foreign debt.
    For the first nine months of 1986 all seemed to be on
target for a repeat, with monthly surpluses averaging one
billion dlrs. But as exports were diverted and imports
increased to avoid further domestic shortages the trade surplus
plunged to 211 mln dlrs in October and since then has averaged
under 150 mln.

trade talks tomorrow amid signs officials from both sides are
growing increasingly irritated with each other.
    The talks, held annually at sub-cabinet level to review the
whole gamut of U.S./Japan economic relations, will pave the way
for American Secretary of State George Schultz's one day
stop-over here at end-week on his way home from China.
    Faced with growing Congressional protectionist pressure,
the U.S. Administration is pressing Japan for speedy action to
reduce its still huge trade surplus, U.S. Officials said.
    "We appreciate their frustration," a senior Japanese
government official said. "But we are also frustrated."
    The official said the 40 pct rise of the yen over the last
18 months has hit Japan hard, forcing exporters to slash
spending and lay off workers to make up for lost sales abroad.
That has not yet shown up in dollar-based statistics on trade,
but it will, he said.
    He said the U.S. Administration was ignoring the progress
that has been made and instead emphasizing the problems that
remain when it talks with Congress.
    "It would only take five minutes to list their
accomplishments," a senior U.S. Official replied.
    The talks begin tomorrow with high-level discussions on the
economic structures of both countries and how they affect the
bilateral trade imbalance, which last year amounted to 51.48
billion dlrs in Japan's favour.
    On the following two days, the topics will range from
multilateral trade talks under the auspices of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to such bilateral trade
problems as super computers.
    The structural talks are intended to be free-wheeling
discussions among senior officials. Tomorrow's topics include
savings and investment issues such as consumer credit and
housing, and the implications of government budget deficits.
    These talks come at a particularly delicate time for the
Japanese government, which is facing increasing domestic
pressure to abandon its tight-fisted fiscal policy and
stimulate the sagging economy by spending more.
    Some U.S. Officials complained Japan has no intention of
boosting domestic demand and imports, as Washington wants.
    Japanese officials in turn pointed the finger at the huge
U.S. Budget deficit as one of the main culprits for the trade
imbalance. That budget deficit has meant that the U.S. Is
buying more imports.
    Japan seems particularly peeved at being singled in a draft
trade bill before the Senate as a nation following adverserial
trade practices. "It condemns Japan without due process," one
Japanese official said.
    That reference spoils what is otherwise a well-thought-out
bill introduced by Democratic Senator Lloyd Bentsen, he said.
    Japan is also not totally happy with the administration's
trade bill, particularly its proposal to establish reciprocal
access to foreign markets as one criteria for retaliatory trade
action by the U.S., Officials said.
    Nevertheless, Japanese officials said they remain in a weak
bargaining position, especially with the threat of a trade bill
overhanging them.
    "We have no leverage," one official admitted.
    As a result, Tokyo is striving to meet U.S. Complaints
about its trade practices in a variety of fields, including
super computers.
    The U.S. Is pressing for greater access to the Japanese
super computer market.
    The Japanese government has sent a long questionnaire to
public institutions like universities which buy the
sophisticated machines in hopes of eventually setting up
informal bidding procedures easily understood by all potential
sellers, officials said.

cuts this year to help narrow its trade surplus with the U.S.,
A senior economic planner said.
    Wang Chao-Ming, vice-chairman of the council for economic
planning and development, told Reuters Taiwan would further
reduce import tariffs on 1,700 products sometime in the second
half of this year.
    Cuts of up to 50 pct on those items were made last year and
Wang said further cuts would go much deeper.
    "We have to speed up liberalisation and cut import tariffs
faster and more substantially," he said.
    The United States, Taiwan's main trading partner, has said
the island's import tariffs, still ranging from a high of
almost 60 pct, were unacceptable. It has criticised the cuts as
too selective.
     Taiwan's trade surplus with the United States hit 13.6
billion dlrs last year. The surplus has boosted foreign
exchange reserves to 50 billion dlrs, which Wang said made
Taiwan a target for U.S. Protectionism.
    Wang said the trade surplus and the reserves weakened
Taiwan's position in talks with Washington over export quotas,
particularly for shoes, textiles and machine tools which are
among the island's main export-earners.
    A special Taiwanese trade delegation leaves for Washington
tomorrow to try to renegotiate an agreement signed last year
limiting exports of Taiwan textiles.
    Under the accord, Taiwan's textile export growth was
limited to 0.5 pct each year until 1988. Taipei has said it is
losing markets to South Korea and Hong Kong which were given
more generous terms.

of a free trade pact with the U.S. was a sign of what many see
as a new spirit of Canadian self-confidence, a public policy
study group said 
    "It suggests the Canada of the immediate post-war period,
when it was a major player in the process of building a postwar
world," the Washington-based Atlantic Council said.
    U.S. and Canadian negotiators opened talks last summer
aimed at dismantling trade barriers between the two countries,
the world's biggest trading partners with crossborder shipments
of about 150 billion dlrs annually.
    The council's study said the trade talks, with a deadline
of October for an agreement, are the biggest issue in
U.S.-Canadian relations.
   The study said liberalized trade between the two countries
would improve the competitiveness of their economies in world
markets and lessen trade irritants which now mar their ties.
    The council said "in the past most Canadians have shied away
from the notion of a free-trade arrangement, fearing to be
overwhelmed economically and politically by a closer
association with a country 10 times their size in population."
    But at the same time, it added, Canadians realized their
domestic market was too small to permit the mass production and
sales needed to raise productivity to the level demanded by an
increasingly competitive world.
    The council said that in the talks, Canada is chiefly
interested in minimizing the imposing of U.S. duties against 
allegedly subsidized exports.
    A recent example was the 15 per cent duty the U.S. imposed
on Canadian lumber exports on grounds the shipments were being
subsidized.
    The council said the chief U.S. concerns included ending
curbs against U.S. banking, insurance, telecommunications, and
the so-called "cultural industries" - publishing, broadcasting
and films.
    It said other major U.S.-Canadian issues were defense
cooperation, "acid rain" and the U.S. rejection of a Canadian
assertion of sovereignty over waters of the Northwest Passage.

Industry (MITI) acted to tighten restrictions on microchip
exports to countries other than the U.S. To preserve a
U.S.-Japan pact on semiconductor trade, but major Japanese
chipmakers doubt its usefulness.
    A MITI spokesman said his ministry had asked chipmakers to
issue certificates to specified trading houses stating they are
authorised exporters.
    Trading houses applying for a MITI export licence will be
required to show such a certificate, but those without it will
not automatically be denied licences, he said.
    But some industry officials predicted any government
measures were likely to have limited effect as long as the
world semiconductor market remained weak.
    U.S. Government and industry officials have complained
repeatedly that Japanese chipmakers continue to sell at below
cost to third countries despite the July agreement.
    Japanese firms and officials in turn argue the flow of
cheap chips to third countries is due to grey-market sales by
third-party brokers, who seek to profit from the gap between
low prices in Japan and higher prices based on production costs
and set for Japanese makers under the agreement.
    The MITI spokesman said, "If the percentage of grey market
is increasing for one specific company, it suggests they are
distributing their products through their sales network knowing
they will be exported by some means. In that case we will ask
them what they are doing to reduce the figure."
    MITI earlier asked makers to cut output of certain chips by
10 pct in first-quarter 1987, spokesmen for the firms said.
    But they doubt the usefulness of the latest move. "As long
as there is a gap between prices set under the pact and market
prices, there will be people who want to exploit the gap to
make money," a Hitachi Ltd <HIT.T> spokesman said.

remove curbs on its exports, to give it favourable trading
status and ease restrictions on exports of high technology.
    But the U.S. Embassy replied that Chinese figures showing
13 years of trade deficits with the U.S. Out of the last 15 are
inaccurate and said Peking itself would have to persuade
Congress to change laws which limit its exports.
     The official International Business newspaper today
published China's demands in a  editorial to coincide with the
visit of U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz.
     "It is extremely important that the U.S. Market reduce its
restrictions on Chinese imports, provide the needed facilities
for them and businessmen from both sides help to expand Chinese
exports," the editorial said.
     "The U.S. Should quickly discard its prejudice against
favourable tariff treatment for Chinese goods and admit China
into the Generalised System of Preference (GSP).
     "Despite easing of curbs on U.S. Technology exports in
recent years, control of them is still extremely strict and
influences normal trade between the two countries," it added
     The paper also printed an article by China's commercial
counsellor in its Washington embassy, Chen Shibiao, who said
that "all kinds of difficulties and restrictions" were preventing
bilateral trade fulfilling its full potential.
     He named them as U.S. Protectionist behaviour, curbs on
technology transfer and out-of-date trade legislation.
     The paper also printed a table showing that, since
bilateral trade began in 1972, China has had a deficit every
year except 1972 and 1977. It shows the 1986 and 1985 deficits
at 2.09 billion and 1.722 billion dlrs.
     A U.S. Embassy official said the U.S. Did not accept
Peking's trade figures at all, mainly because they exclude
goods shipped to Hong Kong and then trans-shipped to U.S. While
U.S. Figures are based on country of origin.
     He said that, if China wants to obtain GSP status, it will
have to lobby Congress itself to persaude it to amend several
laws which currently prevent Peking getting such status.
     The U.S. Trade Act of 1974 says that to qualify for GSP,
China must be a member of the General Agreement of Tariffs and
Trade (GATT), for which it applied in July 1986, and "not be
dominated or controlled by international Communism."
     The official said China was well aware of the laws, some
of which date to the anti-Communist early 1950's, but that
there is not sufficient political will in the U.S. To change
them.
     China has been the subject of about a dozen cases
involving anti-dumping in the U.S. Within the last two years,
which the U.S. Side won, he said.
     But, for the first time, China signed last week an
agreement which it itself initiated to voluntarily restrain
exports of at least two categories of steel goods, which may
lead the U.S. Side to withdraw the anti-dumping case, he added.
     Another diplomat said willingness to provide such
voluntary export restraints would be an important issue in
bilateral trade issues and in Peking's application to GATT.
     "China has the potential to disrupt world markets,
especially in textiles. Other GATT countries will be nervous
about China in this respect. But there is a precedent for other
centralled planned economies in GATT," the diplomat said.
     Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Romania are members of
GATT but none has China's massive market potential for imports
or its vast labour pool to produce cheap exports.
     In a speech today in the northeast city of Dalian, U.S.
Secretary of State George Shultz said his country welcomed
China's interest in participating in GATT.
     "The process of Chinese accession will not be accomplished
overnight -- the GATT rules were not designed for a large
economy of the Chinese type," Shultz said.
     "China can play an important role by actively joining GATT
discussions seeking to expand general trading opportunities and
enhance market access for exports worldwide. China can further
develop its foreign trade system so as to gain the maximum
benefit from its GATT participation," he said.
     The problems facing U.S.-China trade and GATT membership
are similar -- a pricing system which many foreign businessmen
regard as arbitrary and not related to actual costs, especially
for exports, and a de facto dual currency system.
     In a memorandum backing its application presented to GATT
last month, China said it was gradually reforming its economic
system and replacing mandatory instruction with "guidance
planning" and economic levers.
     The diplomat said that, to join GATT, China had much to
do.

De Croo said if Congress passed legislation curbing world
textile imports the only way the European Community (EC) could
react was to retaliate.
    De Croo said at a news conference "if you limit textile
imports, you will re-orient textiles to Europe."
    And that he said would trigger EC taxes on U.S. goods.
    Congress passed a textile bill two years ago, but it was
vetoed by President Reagan on grounds that curbing imports to
protect the domestic textile industry would trigger retaliation
U.S. trading partners.
    A similar bill has been introducted this year, in a
Congress with a bigger Democratic majority and with a President
weakened by the Iran scandal.
    De Croo, here for talks with Administration officials and
Congressmen, said if a textile bill passed, "the only way we
could react would be retaliation, and it would cause more
retaliation, which is not a good way to deal with problems."
    He said if a textile bill was enacted, "we will impose taxes
on a lot of American products."  He said "it would be stupid. We
have to avoid that."
    He said Congressmen seem upset mosty with Japan, because of
its massive trade suprlus with the United States, and not with
EC nations, but EC nations will be hurt by the diverted 
shipments of Asian textiles.
    De Croo also criticized the way U.S. officials try to solve
EC trade issues, saying "each time we come in contact, it a
conflict contact. The clouts are coming fom the West."
    He said it then is a crisis atmosphere with officials cross

Chairman Dan Rostenkowski said Congress must avoid a temptation
to pass a protectionist trade bill this year.
    In remarks prepared for delivery before the National Press
Club, Rostenkowski, D-Ill., predicted major trade legislation
will be sent to President Reagan by the end of this year.
    But he warned that his "conciliatory message" on the trade
bill did not mean he would oppose a proposal that would warn
other countries their access to the American market would be
curtailed unless they opened their markets to U.S. goods.
    "Complaints about (foreign trade) restraints are not a
smoke screen for protectionism, they a plea for fairness,"
Rostenkowski said.
    "It is only reasonable to ask the nations that have denied
us access to open up in return for continued freedom in the
American market," he added.
    However, he said there would likely be changes in the
market access proposal from the plan which cleared the House

foreign countries to ease import restraints or they would face

named Malcolm Stephens, director of export finance at Barclay's
Bank Plc and a former career civil servant at ECGD for 17
years, to the post of executive director, a department
spokesman said.
    Stephens replaces Jack Gill, who is retiring early aged 57.
    A drop in the ECGD's business volume and a rise in its debt
to the Exchequer have led to criticism in Parliament in recent
years.
    Stephens said the fall in business volume was a top
convern, adding that the department may have to compete more
aggressively with private insurance firms providing similar
services.
    The department's annual report for the year ended March 31,
1986, showed exports insured by the department fell to 15.7
billion stg from 17.4 billion the year before, while its debt
to the Exchequer almost doubled to 756 mln stg.
    Stephens said he had no specific list of changes. But among
his chief concerns was the weakened condition of lesser
developed countries and their ability to pay for their imports.
    The agency will have to review its policies on insuring
export credits to lesser credits on a country by country basis,
he said. "Large lump political risk insurance is the sort of
thing we want to take a look at."
    "You have to try to look forward to see if you are simply in
a peak and trough situation or it is a more long term thing,"
Stephens said, in response to a qustion about whether ECGD will

recipients.
    He noted that certain countries have already been removed

    He told a National Press Club luncheon there would be a
number of tax proposals that could be debated if Reagan sought
a tax increase to help balance the budget.
    However, he said he would prefer to leave the tax rates
enacted in last year's tax reform bill unchanged.
    There have been calls in Congress to hold the rates at the

this month aimed at boosting exports to reach European
Community levels, director-general of the INFE export
institute, Apolonio Ruiz Ligero, said.
    "The target is to raise exports to 20 pct of Gross Domestic
Product over the next four years compared to 15 pct now," he
said.
     "This is the minimum prevailing level in the EC and there
is no reason why we should lag behind countries like Italy,
which have a similar productive structure," he said.
    The plan calls for providing soft loans, tax cuts and other
fiscal benefits to exporters and raising Spain's presence in
international trade fairs.
    Consumer goods such as fashion and wine, as well as
traditional industrial exports will be promoted.
    Ruiz Ligero said INFE would double its annual budget to 20
billion pesetas to finance the four-year plan, while the
government's development aid fund (FAD) would provide a special
25 billion peseta grant.
    The plan calls for boosting exports by five to six pct in
real terms this year after a 7.4 pct decline last year.
    Ruiz Ligero attributed this drop to a lack of demand in
developing countries and a rally in domestic consumer demand,
which rose six pct last year after 1.9 pct in 1985.
    He added that 80 pct of Spain's exports went to
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
countries.
    The EC accounts for 60 pct of the market and exports to the
Community rose seven pct last year. The government plans to
concentrate efforts on Western Europe and the U.S.
    "The problem is convincing businessmen that exports are
vital to survival in the context of EC competition," he said.
    He said Spanish businessmen traditionally turned to the
domestic market to satisfy rises in consumer demand, while
turning their backs on foreign markets.
    "They have to realise their share of the home market is
going to shrink with growing deregulation," he said. "Foreign
companies are taking up positions in the domestic economy and
it is it vital to secure a market share abroad."

trade surplus with the U.S. is bound to diminish as the
country switches purchases from Japan in favor of U.S.
companies, Trade Minister Woong-Bae Rha said.
     He rejected suggestions the Korean Won is undervalued, and
denied any plans for a "drastic and sudden" revaluation.
    Rha is heading a trade mission to 37 U.S. cities. Last year
South Korea ran a 4.3 billion dlr trade surplus, including a
record 7.1 billion surplus with the U.S. and a 5.5 billion dlr
deficit with Japan.
    Rha told Reuters in an interview the current trade mission
is looking for 2.0 billion dlrs in purchases from U.S.
companies, about a quarter of which represents "transferred
purchases from Japanese sources."
    Rha said the items being sought by the current mission are
"mainly chemicals, machinery and parts."
    He said South Korea is the fourth largest importer of U.S.
agricultural products. The current mission is not involved in
that area but there are plans to buy "substantial amounts of
cotton" from the U.S.
    He noted his country "is clearly not as open as the American
market. Nor is it reasonable to expect that it should be,"
considering South Korea has a 40 billion dlr foreign debt and
spends six pct of its gross national product on defense.

decision on whether to set up a dispute panel on the basis of a
European Community complaint against the U.S.- Japanese
agreement on exports of computer semiconductors.
    David Woods, spokesman of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (GATT), told a news briefing that the main parties
would continue bilateral talks. This was in the hope of
resolving the row before the next Council meeting on April 15.
    The five-year accord signed in July 1986 aims to protect
the U.S. Market from dumping of low-price Japanese microchips,
officially known as semiconductors.
    The E.C. Complained the accord breached GATT trade rules by
allowing Tokyo to monitor prices, allowing it to set minimum
prices for Japanese chips sold in third countries.
    The 12-nation Community also charged the agreement gave
U.S. Producers preferential access to the Japanese market.
    Woods said many nations -- Hong Kong, Canada, Switzerland,
Singapore, Sweden, Malaysia and Nigeria -- had supported the EC
complaint during the heated Council debate.
    Japan's delegate, Minoru Endo, and U.S. Ambassador Michael

protectionist bills being considered by Congress could trigger
retaliation by the European Community (EEC) and threaten the
global trading system.
    Paul Channon, secretary for trade and industry, said if
Congress passed legislation to curb textile imports, which
would hit EC shipments as well as shipments from major Asian
textile producers, "the community would have to retaliate."
    His comments echoed those made yesterday by Belgian Trade
Minister Herman De Croo, who said if the bill passed, the
community would retaliate by imposing taxes on U.S. exports.
    Channon made his remarks at a news conference after two
days of talks with Reagan Administration officials and members
of Congress.
    De Croo was also in Washington for trade talks.
    Channon said there was a greater protectionism sentiment in
Congress since his visit here last year as Congress and the
Administration tried to find ways to reduce the U.S. trade
deficit, which last year hit a record 169.8 billion dlrs.
    Channon also called for greater EC-U.S. cooperation to
force Japan to open its markets to foreign goods.
    Channon said Japan's trade surplus is causing everyone
problems - its surplus with the United States last year was
51.5 billion dlrs and with EC nations, 16.7 billion dlrs.
    "The more united pressure there could be, the better," he
said.
    Channon also called for increased U.S.-EC cooperation to
avoid trade disputes.
    He said the two sides narrowly avoided a confrontation
earlier this year over lost grains sales when Spain and
Portugal joined the community and its liberal imports
regulations were tightened to conform to EC standards.
    "But if both sides drew back from the brink that time," he
said, ""it does not mean that they would do so on another
occasion."
    Channon added that "There is increasing reesentment in
Europe over the U.S. tactic of negotiating under the pressure
of unilaterally imposed deadlines."
    He said other potential conflicts are already in sight -
alleged European government subsidies of Airbus aircraft and
taxes on fats and oils - and "the commuity and the United States
must therefore learn to manage their relations better."
    He said another bill to let the United States retaliate
against a nation if that nation's market was not open to U.S.
goods would bypass the trade pact GATT (General Agreeeement on
Tariffs and Trade) as an arbiter of trade practices.
    He said foreign trade law should be judged by GATT and not
by the United States, adding "if the (trade) law is to be
interpreted by the United States and not by the GATT, what is
to happen to the rest of us?"

issues including China's admission to the General Agreements on

The admission of China to GATT, which is the multinational

economy 15 billion dlrs and has made clear it wants Washington
to take a lead in repairing the damage after lifting remaining
restrictions two weeks ago.
    Polish officials are unable to provide a precise breakdown
of the figure, saying it takes into account a number of
hypothetical losses. Some of them are "too sophisticated to
convert into financial terms," one banking source said.
    But Western economic experts say the effect of sanctions is
impossible to calculate.
    They say it is blurred by the poor performance of Poland's
economy, and dismiss the 15 billion dlr figure as illusory.
    "Sanctions have provided a very useful excuse for under-
achieving. They did have a bad effect, yes, but they only
contributed to largely internal, economic problems," one said.
    The U.S. Imposed the measures and withdrew Most Favoured
Nation (MFN) trading status from Poland in 1982 in retaliation
for suppression of the Solidarity free trade union under
martial law. The estimated cost to the Polish economy was
originally devised several years ago by the Institute of
National Economy, an offshoot of the central planning
commission.
    According to one Western envoy, an expert on Polish
economic affairs, it extrapolated 1979 information on growth
trends in trade with the United States, as well as increases in
credits from Western commercial and government lenders.
    But the calculations were based on a time when trade was
booming and credits still flowed freely, he said, dismissing
the estimate as "a theoretical projection based on a high point,
which has no real scientific evaluation."
    A foreign trade ministry official said Polish exports to
the U.S. In the late 1970s averaged around 400 mln dlrs
annually and had fallen by half since the sanctions were
imposed.
    Imports have suffered, slumping from around 800 mln dlrs to
200 mln, as credits ran out. Poland has a dwindling trade
surplus with the West. Last year it was one billion dlrs
against a targeted 1.6 billion, official figures show.
    Acknowledging that sanctions have lost Poland important
U.S. Markets -- including agricultural equipment, textiles,
chemicals and some foodstuffs -- Western economists say credits
dried up for economic not political reasons.  "Poland is
accusing the West of letting economic relations deteriorate for
political reasons," said one expert. "It's an illusion based on a
misunderstanding of Western economy."
    "There's a limit to how much you can go on giving someone
who has no hope of repaying it," another said, adding that
Poland had benefited from a global phenomenon of easy credits
in the 1970s which were no longer today's reality.
    Describing the 15 billion dlr assessment as "nebulous," one
diplomat said it also included losses of hypothetical orders
and setbacks to Polish research through the curbing of
scientific links and exchanges.  Western officials say the
lifting of sanctions and new MFN status will have little impact
on Poland, which has a hard currency debt of 33.5 billion dlrs
and lacks the means to modernise its industry.
    "MFN doesn't really mean anything, only that Poland will not
be treated worse than other countries. It will be difficult to
regain access to the U.S. Market because different forces are
in play now," said one Western envoy.
    He said Polish products were not competitive, and their
quality was too low. Trade wars and possible protectionist
measures amongst the U.S., Japan and Europe would also hamper
Poland's efforts to regain entry.
    Deputy foreign trade minister Janusz Kaczurba recognised
this fact recently.
    Kaczurba told the official PAP news agency recently, "Making
up our lost position will take a long time and be uncommonly
difficult, and in certain cases impossible... In a period of
two to three years it will be possible to increase the level of
exports by only about 100 mln dlrs."
    While Poland is unlikely to seek compensation, it says it
has a "moral right" to assistance from the U.S. Which it says
imposed the sanctions illegally. But a Western economist said
"The argument that U.S. Sanctions were a unilateral torpedoing
of the Polish economy won't cut any ice. The Americans will
just reply that the Poles acted immorally in crushing
Solidarity."
    Nevertheless, Polish National Bank head Wladyslaw Baka, in
talks in Washington last week with the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) and World Bank, made it clear that Poland was
looking for a lead from the United States.
    He was quoted by PAP as saying that Poland would meet its
financial obligations to the United States, "but not in a short
time and not without a cooperative stand on the part of its
foreign economic partners."
    He stressed that the U.S. "had a particular opportunity to
play a part in the cooperative policy of Poland's partners
interested in the settlement of Polish debt."
    Putting it more sharply, one senior banking official blamed
Washington for obstructing talks with the World Bank, IMF and
Paris Club of Western creditor governments in recent years and
said it should now play a more positive role.
    "As a major superpower the United States can influence
international organisations," he said, citing recent meetings
aimed at stabilising currencies as an example of the extent to
which Western nations were prepared to cooperate.

government representatives called for a sweeping reform of
world agriculture to redress a critical demand and supply
imbalance.
    Speakers at a conference on world agricultural markets here
demonstrated a growing U.S.-European consensus on the need for
an urgent and collective overhaul of world farm trade and
production.
    "It is vital that we work together to bring more freedom and
harmony into the world agricultural trade...(if not) the
disruptions in markets may grow even more severe, the walls of
protection climb higher and the level of possible retaliation
become more harmful," U.S. Department of Agriculture Deputy
Administrator William Bailey said.
    Bailey said his attendance at the two-day meeting, which
ends tomorrow, demonstrated the U.S. recognises the need to
adjust its policies to the changing market environment.
    The need for urgent reforms is justified by the "imbalance
and tensions of the world economy," the secretary general of the
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
Jean-Claude Paye said.
    And the forum for such a reform is the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, he noted.
    Paye stressed the need for a progressive and joint
reduction of agricultural subsidies as well as social measures
to help farmers in unprofitable areas.
    Another possible solution would be to stop supporting farm
prices, allowing them to be fixed by supply and demand, and
instead help farmers through income support and adjustment
aids, proposed James Howard, Executive Vice-president of
Cargill (USA), one of the world's largest cereal houses.
    Franz-Josef Feiter, agricultural adviser to West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, agreed the European Community must take
greater heed of market constraints in fixing farm prices.
    However, "differentiated policy treatment is required" to
take account of large disparities in the situation around the
EC, he said.
    "Agriculture is an efficient sector of the European economy
and will remain so if the right policy is pursued within the
Community," he said.

States and Canada could spur the economies of both sides
substantially, according to a study released by the Institute
for International Economics.
    The study, by Paul Wonnacott, said a successful conclusion
to the free trade talks now under way could raise Canada's
gross national product by more than five pct and expand U.S.
export's by about seven pct.
    He said the pact could resolve the knotty issue of
government subsidies, end curbs on trade in services and
investments and pave the way for new global talks under the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
    The United States and Canada - the world's two biggest
trading partners with cross border shipments of about 150
billion dlrs a year - opened free trade talks last June. They
are aiming for a pact by next October.
    Wonnacott, an economics professor at the Univerity of
Maryland, said an agreement should include:
    - Elimination of tariffs between the two countries, phased
in over a five to 10-year period;
    - Equal access to federal government procurement in the two
countries, replacing current "Buy America" and "Buy Canada"
provisions with a "Buy North America" provision;
    - Fewer restrictions in trade in services, chiefly finance
and transportation;
    - A commitment not to screen foreign investments in favor
domestic producers;
    - A commission to resolve bilateral trade disputes.
     Wonnacott said that to resolve the subsidy problem, the
two sides should permit export subsidies of exports of up to
2.0 or 2.5 pct without imposing coutervailing duties.
    The limit on subsidies is now 0.5 pct.
    He proposed that any attempt to impose new duties to offset
subsidies should go first a special disputes commission for
resolution at an early stage.
    Wonnacott said "bilateral free trade would contribute to the
efficiency of the North American economies and to their
competitiveness in facing overseas producers.
    He said it would it would open U.S. markets to Canadian
goods and enable them to benefit from the economies of mass
production.
    Benefits to the United States would be fewer than those to
Canada proportionately, he said, because of the already large
U.S. gross national product.
    Wonnacott said also that a U.S.-Canada pact in such areas
as export subsidies and the creation of a dispute commission
could set an example for the current attempt by GATT to write
new and more liberal global trading regulations.

strong-armed into compliance with a U.S.-Japan pact on
semiconductors halting predatory pricing and opening Japan's
market to foreign chips, industry analysts said.
    But doubts remain over whether the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry (MITI), which is pressuring
the firms, can successfully battle market forces and whether
the U.S. Industry is geared up to take advantage of any
breathing space, they said.
    U.S. Threats to scrap the agreement signed last September
have pushed MITI to try harder to get recalcitrant Japanese
chipmakers to abide by the pact, the analysts said.
    "MITI has been moving hot and heavy throughout the industry
to get things done," said Bache Securities (Japan) associate
vice president Peter Wolffe.
    Last month, MITI told chipmakers to cut production for the
January to March period by 10 pct to help dry up inexpensive
chips that have escaped from Japan to grey markets not subject
to the pact's price controls.
    The ministry also asked electronics firms to provide
distributors with certificates designating them as authorised
exporters, in an effort to close loopholes through which grey
marketeers sneak chips out of Japan, market analysts said.
    U.S. Trade negotiators here last week said the pact was in
jeopardy because of continued dumping in non-American markets
and little sign of increased foreign sales in Japan.
    But major Japanese firms appear to have agreed to the
production cuts, several analysts said. Last week, NEC Corp
said it would cut production in line with MITI's request.
    "NEC has been the most aggressive in resisting MITI's
demands," said David Keller, analyst at James Capel and Co. "Once
NEC cuts production, it means they all have."
    Still, pressures remain to keep production high. Japanese
firms need high output to cut unit prices for U.S. Sales that
the Commerce Department assigns them under the pact.
    "The best way to lower cost is to produce more," said Salomon
Brothers Asia Ltd analyst Carole Ryavec.
    Preparations for a possible upturn in demand could also
spur higher production next quarter, Merrill Lynch analyst Matt
Aizawa said.
    Grey marketeers may also be able to outfox any new
restrictions, some industry officials said.
    "It's like tax avoidance schemes," said Steve Donovan, head
of MMI Japan K.K. "As soon as you close one route, another
opens."
    MITI's pressure has annoyed some makers, who had earlier
shrugged off MITI guidance.
    "It's getting to be like communism," said one.
    But analysts said output cuts could help by making it
easier to increase prices as planned on April 1 and forcing
firms to stop extending market share by selling at a loss.
    "They're going to have to start running their businesses
like businesses," Bache's Wolffe said.
    MITI has also been conducting a highly public campaign
urging chip users to buy foreign-made chips, but U.S. Industry
officials said response has been mixed at best.
    "There has been some change, but it's not across the board,"
said one U.S. Spokesman. "The companies have a varying degree of
urgency."
    The ultimate impact of all these efforts by MITI on the
troubled U.S. Industry remains in doubt, analysts added.
    Pressure to cut production of 256 kilobit DRAM (dynamic
random access memory) chips could merely speed the transition
to one megabit chips, where Japan now leads, analysts said.
    Whether U.S. Firms are able to stage a comeback in memory
chips, or interested in doing so, also remains unclear, they
said.
    Analysts are watching with interest the fate of a new U.S.
Consortium which hopes to challenge Japan by developing the
most advanced technology for microchip manufacturing.
    Even in the thorny area of access, much depends on U.S.
Commitment as well as on Japanese openness, some said.
    "The SIA (U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association) doesn't
even have an office here," a source close to the industry said.
"You could question just how committed they are."
    In addition, some industry analysts question the
effectiveness of a bilateral agreement that leaves out third
country chipmakers such as those in South Korea.
    "(South) Korea's gaining market share," said one analyst.
"They're the real winners from the agreement."

Woong Bae said his nation would maintain a trading surplus for
three to five years as a way to cut its foreign debt.
    He said in an interview with Reuters that after a few years
it was likely South Korea would drop barriers to foreign goods
and move toward a more balanced trade position.
    He said the present trade surplus was vital if his nation
was to reduce its 44.5 billion dlr foreign debt.
    Rha said that 1986 was the first year South Korea had a
trade surplus - 4.5 billion dlrs, against a 1985 deficit of 900
mln dlrs.
    Asked if South Korea would drop its trade barriers once its
foreign debt was substantially reduced, he said "yes, I think
so."
    Rha made his remarks at the end of a two-week trade mission
here during which a team he led agreed to buy U.S. products
valued at 1.8 billion dlrs.
    About 800 mln dlrs of the purchases are in goods of the
type South Korea normally bought from Japan.
    Rha was to leave later today for Ottawa for trade talks
with Canadian officials and businessmen.
    He said in the interview the U.S. purchases were to reduce
his country's 7.1 billion dlr surplus with the United States
and also to cut its 5.6 billion dlr shortfall with Japan.
    Rha said it was also due to a shift in exchange rates
between the U.S. dollar and the yen that made it cheaper to buy
U.S. goods than Japanese goods.
    He said South Korea heavily relied on foreign trade and he
hoped the leaders of major trading nations could find a way to
resolve the growing trend toward protectionist legislation.
    Rha said "I hope the leaders can get together to find a
solution by making some mutually satisfactory concessions."
    But he added "the leaders seem hesitant to make concessions
because of domestic political reasons."
    Speaking of his own country, he said "We have made a lot of
concessions already."
    He cited regulations permitting foreign investment in
industrial firms, allowing increased foreign banking activity
and cracking down on piracy of intellectual property by
strengthening protection of copyrights and patents.
    Rha said South Korea had also lowered many of its tariffs.
    Asked if South Korea would retaliate against U.S. goods if
Congress closed U.S. markets to its products, he said "at this
moment, we have no thought of retaliation."
    South Korea is a major exporter to the United States of
textiles and apparel and electronic goods, such as television
sets, video cassette records and personal computers.
    Its puchases from the United States include electronic

    The trade mission's purchases here included three Boeing
passenger planes for 400 mln dlrs, four McDonnell Douglas
planes for 300 mln dlrs; and machinery worth 725 mln dlrs.

first votes on measures designed to toughen U.S. trade laws but
held over until tomorrow the most difficult votes on
controversial plans to protect American industries.
    Meeting in closed session, the House Ways and Means Trade
Subcommittee failed to resolve one of the most sensitive issues
in the bill--whether they will force major foreign trading
partners to severely cut their trade surpluses with the United
States.
    The subcommittee is considering a toned-down version of
Democratic-sponsored trade legislation that aims to open
foreign markets but which drops last year's effort to force
President Reagan to retaliate with quotas or tariffs.
    Congressional aides who asked not to be identified said the
lawmakers intend to wrap up their proposals tomorrow and will
consider a proposal to mandate retaliation without setting
specific trade penalties.
    The legislation faces another hurdle in the full Ways and
Means Committee next week before the full House votes on it.
    Rep. Richard Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat who is seeking
his party's 1988 presidential nomination, said he may offer an
amendment to call for reductions in the trade surpluses of
those countries with barriers to imports of U.S. goods.
    This would be a moderated version of his earlier plan to
force a mandatory ten per cent annual cut in the trade surplus
with the United States by Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, West
Germany and other countries with the largest trade imbalances.
    "My criteria for a good amendment sets a standard for
getting the trade deficit down," he told reporters.
    The trade law changes are to become part of a major
congressional and administration effort to turn around the
record U.S. trade deficit of 169 billion dlrs last year by
opening up foreign markets and making U.S. products more
competitive.
    House Speaker James Wright, a Texas Democrat, said again
today he expects the full House will approve the trade bill by
May and that Reagan will accept the final congressional bill.
    "I expect whatever is reported (by the Ways and Means
Committee) will pass. We will have a good bill and an effective
bill," he told reporters.
    The comprehensive trade bill will include work by other
committees to ease export controls on high technology, to aid
U.S. workers displaced by foreign competition, to stimulate
research and development, to remove foreign trade barriers and
to improve education and worker training.
    The lawmakers agreed that for the first time a U.S.
industry could charge foreign producers with unfair competition
if they deny basic worker rights such as collective bargaining,
safety rules and payment of a minimum wage appropriate to the
country's economic development.
    They transferred to U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
Yeutter the powers now held by Reagan to decide whether to
retaliate against foreign violations of fair trade rules and
whether an injured industry deserves import relief.
    They agreed to make it easier for a company to get
temporary relief from import competition but agreed the
industry should provide a plan to become competitive.
    The administration has not announced its support but
Yeutter said yesterday, "I am cautiously optimistic," that the
Democratic-led House will come up with an acceptable bill.

Vsevolod Murakhovsky said at the end of a brief visit here his
country wanted to boost joint business with France, but that a
reduction of France's trade deficit with the Soviet Union
depended on the French.
    Murakhovsky, who is also chairman of the State
Agro-Industrial Committee (GOSAGROPROM), told a news conference
he had discussed a variety of possible deals with French
companies Rhone-Poulenc, Pechiney and Imec.
    Declining to put figures on possible contracts he said he
had discussed plant protection and the processing of highly
sulphuric gas with Rhone-Poulenc, packaging technology for
agricultural products with Pechiney, and fruit and vegetable
juice processing with Imec.
    An official for Pechiney said an agreement of intent on
packaging could be signed soon, but could not give any other
details. The other two companies were not immediately available
for comment.
    Asked whether he foresaw a reduction this year of France's
trade shortfall, at 7.6 billion francs in the first 11 months
of 1986 against 5.1 billion for the whole of 1985, Murakhovsky
told Reuters: "It all depends on France."
    At a meeting in Paris last January French and Soviet
foreign trade ministers said they were committed to increased
efforts to reduce the deficit. Estimates at the time showed a
French 190 mln franc surplus for December 1986.
    Murakhovsky said the Soviet Union was prepared to talk with
anybody with "interesting" proposals offering latest technology
and assuring "a mutual advantage."
    He said the Soviet Union had many tasks ahead of it and
would deal rapidly with proposals it considered interesting.
    He encouraged companies to take advantage of new laws
guaranteeing "the interests of foreign partners" in joint
ventures.
    But he said no agreements had yet been finalised under the
new joint venture laws.
    He said concrete deals had not yet been finalised as a
result of a one billion dollar accord signed in Moscow last
month with French businessman Jean-Baptiste Doumeng.
    He said Doumeng's Interagra company was preparing proposals
for further examination by the Soviet Union. Doumeng last month
said the agreement was to exchange one billion dollars worth of
goods.
    Murakhovsky said the agreement was one of intent, and
designed primarily to renew and increase the Soviet Union's
food production capacity.

increase foreign imports or risk the rise of protectionism and
the harm it would bring to it and other trading nations.
    British Trade and Industry Secretary Paul Channon said
Japan must heed a report issued by a Japanese government
advisory body in December calling for faster domestic demand to
help cut its trade surplus and restructure its economy.
    "I recognise that the strong yen has brought problems to
Japan's domestic economy," he told a group of Japanese
businessmen in London.
    "But these short term difficulties should not be allowed to
deflect Japan from the fundamental reforms necessary," he said.
    "It is not just a domestic issue for Japan. If import
propensity does not expand very soon there is a real risk from
protectionist lobbies, particularly in the U.S. With whom Japan
has so massive a surplus," he said.
    "They may well succeed in securing action by governments
which would be highly injurious to trading nations like Japan
and the U.K."
    Channon said there had been substantial growth in the
volume of trade between Japan and Britain, amounting to 6.2
billion sterling (9.8 billion dlrs) last year.

direction, with the Japanese selling us 3.7 billion sterling

held "frank" discussions with the Canadian province premiers on
the pace of free trade talks with the United States, but the
longstanding issue of provincial ratification remains to be
settled.
    Speaking to reporters after nearly five hours of meetings
with the 10 premiers, Mulroney said further discussions would
be held in June and September to discuss the role of the
provinces in approving any new trade deal.
    But he maintained progress was being made in the sweeping
talks with the Unites States that got under nearly two years
ago.
    "It appears reasonable progress is being made (in the
talks)," Mulroney said.
    Alberta Premier Don Getty agreed, "Things are running pretty
quickly now."
    The talks, launched by Mulroney's Progressive Conservative
government after concerns about protectionist sentiment in the
U.S., are aimed reducing the remaining barriers between the
world's largest trading partnership.
    But the provinces are expected to play a major role in any
new trading arrangement, and some of the provincial leaders
complained of a lack of progress on reaching a ratification
formula.
    "It's my view that we should be thinking about these things
right now, along with the questions of the substance of the
agreement," commented Ontario Premier David Peterson, who has
been highly critical of the talks in the past.
    But Newfoundland Premier Brian Peckford said an agreement
was more likely to emerge by consensus and there would be no
need for a "hard and fast formula."
    Peckford said it appears Canada is prepared to make
concessions to the United States on financial services in order
to make inroads on other bargaining areas, such as agriculture.
    Canadian published reports, quoting government sources, say
the two countries are close to reaching a trade deal and it
will involve eliminating border tariffs and many non-tariff
barriers over the next 10 to 12 years.
    A rough draft of the accord is expected to be presented to
the premiers at the June meeting while the finished document is
hoped to be presented to Congress in October.
    "It's a very tight time frame," Ontario's Peterson said last
night. "But at this moment it is tough to say what will
transpire."

is moving toward passage of a trade bill that sponsors said was
intended to help open foreign markets to U.S. agricultural
goods and to modify some U.S. agricultural trade laws.
    The trade subcommittee voted to require President Reagan to
take into account the potential harm to U.S. agricultural
exports of any trade retaliation he might impose for foreign
unfair trade practices against other domestic industries.
    The bill would allow U.S. agricultural producers to seek
government monitoring of imports if there is a reasonable
chance the industry would be harmed by an import surge.
    The full Ways and Means Committee is to consider the bill
next week and congressional sources said they expect it will be
approved.
     In investigations involving a processed agricultural
product, trade associations of processors or producers would
have to petition for relief from foreign dumping or unfair
duties.
     The bill sets out U.S. trade negotiating objectives for
the Uruguay round of talks under the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade. It would seek fair trade in agriculture,
seek to discipline restrictive or trade distorting import and
export practices, to eliminate tariffs, subsidies, quotas and
non-tariff barriers.
     President Reagan's authority to negotiate a new GATT
agreement would be extended through January 1993 and authority
to negotiate a free trade zone with Canada would be extended
through January 3, 1991.
    The bill extends Reagan's authority to negotiate an
international coffee agreement through October 31, 1989.
    It allows a refund of import duties paid on raw sugar
imported from November 1, 1977 to March 31, 1985 for production
of sugar or products containing sugar and destined for
re-export. The export of the sugar or products must occur
before Octoer 1, 1991.
    Presently, to qualify for the refund the sugar must be
processed within three years after import and exported within
five years.
    Agriculture would also benefit from more rapid decisions in
complaints of unfair foreign trade practices or injury from
imports.

to sign an agreement in Moscow next week settling Cairo's three
billion dlr military debt, Egyptian officials said.
    One official, who asked to remain anonymous, told Reuters a
draft agreement would reduce to zero from two pct future
interest payable on the 10 year-old debt, and set a 25 year
repayment term.
    Talks are due to begin in Moscow on Wednesday.
    Economy Minister Youssri Mustapha, who leaves for Moscow on
Tuesday, met President Hosni Mubarak and Egyptian ambassador to
Moscow Salah Bassiouni to discuss the issue.
    One official said Egypt would propose a new exchange rate
for trade with the Soviet Union. Current commerce is based on a
rate set in the 1960s of 0.38 Egyptian pounds to the dollar
which Moscow sees as unreasonable. The fluctuating official
rate is about 1.36 pounds to the dollar.
    The officials said part of the debt would be paid in
exports of goods such as textiles, leather and furniture.
    Egypt wants to settle the debt problem partly to open the
door for new cooperation, mainly in modernising Soviet-built
steel, aluminium and fertiliser plants under a five-year
development plan ending June 30 1992.
    Egypt, which already imports Soviet coal, wood, newsprint
and glass, also wanted a debt deal to allow purchases of
currently blocked spare parts for its ageing Soviet military
hardware, the officials said.
    An estimated 65 pct of Egypt's arsenal is still made up of
Soviet-supplied equipment, one official said.
    Cairo stopped repaying Moscow for arms purchases in 1977
when then-president Anwar Sadat broke with its long-standing
ally and turned to the U.S..

Baldrige predicted Congress will pass a reasonable trade bill
this year and said tough protectionist legislation could prompt
a trade war.
    "The mood of the Congress right now is as tough on trade as
I've ever seen it in six years in Washington," Baldrige said in
a weekend television interview.
    "I think we'll still be able to get a reasonable trade bill
out in spite of that because the whole Congress is trying to
work together with the administration, but there is a hardening
trade attitude," he said.
    President Reagan opposes protectionist legislation but
agreed to support a trade bill when it became apparent that
opposition Democrats would pass such legislation.
    However, Baldrige warned measures that would penalize
trading partners such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan for
failing to cut their trade surpluses with the U.S. could lead
to retaliation and he said he would urge Reagan to veto any
such bill.
    When asked if there is a rising danger of a worldwide trade
war, Baldrige said: "Yes, I don't think there's any question
about that."

    West German exports to the European Community were 21.60

and 22.94 billion in January last year, the figures showed.
    Exports to developing nations and centrally-planned

    Separately, Commerzbank AG said in a report that the focus
of West German exports this year was likely to shift to Europe

showdown between protectionists and free traders as a major
trade bill winds its way through committees to a vote by the
full House of Representatives in late April.
    In a move to toughen U.S. enforcement of trade laws, a key
House subcommittee last week approved a toned down version of
legislation to require President Reagan to retaliate against
foreign countries that follow unfair trade practices.
    This bill will be the cornerstone of congressional efforts
to restore competitiveness of American industries and turn
around last year's record 169 billion dlrs trade deficit.
    Several lawmakers have argued the new trade bill made too
many concessions to Reagan and said they intend to back
amendments to "get tough" with countries that violate trade
agreements or keep out U.S. products.
     On the other hand, congressmen known for their allegiance
to free trade, said the bill ties Reagan's hands too much in
trade disputes and they will seek to restore his negotiating
powers.
    Republican Bill Frenzel of Michigan said the subcommittee's
bill was not one "that a free trader like me could endorse in
all respects," but he emphasized there was a consensus among
trade lawmakers to work toward a bill Reagan and Republicans
would ultimately endorse.
    Frenzel said the goal of trade legislation was, "to make our
trade policy stronger without violating our international trade
agreements. You'll find a lot of people who think we have not
done the former enough. You'll find poeple who think we haven't
avoided violating agreements."
    In a key concession made at the urging of the powerful
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, the trade
subcommittee backed off a requirement that would have forced
Reagan to automatically impose quotas or tariffs on imports
from countries that engage in unfair trade practices.
    It also agreed he may waive any retaliation if it would
hurt the U.S. economy.
    Ways and Means chairman Dan Rostenkowski, an Illinois
Democrat, insisted the more moderate approach was necessary if
the House wanted to pass a bill Reagan would sign into law.
    Reagan last year had blocked Senate consideration of a
tough House trade bill he branded as protectionist and this
year only reluctantly agreed to support a trade bill when he
saw Democratic leaders were determined to pass a bill.
    As an indication of his success, White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater told reporters Friday the administration still
did not like some provisions. But he added, "Generally we feel
very good about the bipartisan consideration of the trade
legislation. I think we are progressing very well."
    The first battle will take place next week when the full
House Ways and Means Committee considers an amendment by Rep.
Richard Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, to force countries such
as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan to cut their trade surpluses
with the United States.
    The subcommittee limited the Gephardt plan to provide only
that the existence of a large trade surplus with the United
States will trigger an investigation of unfair trade practices,
but would not automatically set off retaliation.
    Rep. Phil Crane, an Illinois Republican and staunch free
trader, said he will try to further weaken the Gephardt plan.
    Organized labor has pressed lawmakers for more relief from
imports where jobs have been lost to foreign competition.
AFL-CIO president Lane Kirkland this year angered the
administration in a statement that any trade bill Reagan would
sign would not be worth passage in Congress.
    But Rostenkowski set the tone of the trade debate in a
statement, "I'm not trying to write legislation to please Lane
Kirkland. I'm trying to write legislation that will be signed
by the president."
    In writing the bill, the subcommittee rejected calls for
trade relief for specific industries such as textiles.
    Rep. Ed Jenkins, a Democrat from Georgia, agreed to hold
off his fight. He intends to push separately a bill to protect
the domestic textile and shoe industry, an aide said. Reagan
vetoed a similar measure last year.
    House Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat, is one of the
most influential proponents of aid for specific industries
beset by low priced foreign competition.
    Wright Thursday renewed his call for import relief for the
domestic oil industry and announced his support for a Senate
plan to trigger a temporary oil import tariff when imports
reach half of domestic consumption.
    For the most part, the trade bill's provisions toughen U.S.
enforcement of trade laws. The bill forces the administration
to act rapidly on complaints of unfair trade practices such as
dumping products in the United States at prices below the cost
of production.
    It also forces the administration to act rapidly when an
industry complains that a surge in imports threatens its
existence. Congressmen said the change would have required the
U.S. International Trade Commission to impose limits on car
imports in 1981.

"significant progress" was being made in trade talks with the
United States and a profile of a major deal was emerging.
    Opening a debate on free trade in the House of Commons,
Mulroney said an accord would create thousands of jobs in
Canada and bring greater economic prosperity to both countries.
    Mulroney, who offered few new details of the talks, said
that while the negotiations were risky and difficult, "a
profile of a major trade deal is now emerging."
  In a 50-minute address, Mulroney made an often passionate
defense of the initiative that he said would give poorer areas
of the country a major economic boost.
    "Because of our trading patterns over a period of decades,
we are in the process of building two Canadas -- one that is
rich and promising, one that is under-developed and
under-employed," said Mulroney.
    "What we want is to make sure Newfoundlanders and British
Columbians and Albertans and others, that they get their
chance. They must be given the opportunity to trade their way
to prosperity."
    Few detials have been released on the trade talks which
were launched nearly two years ago between the two nations that
are each others most important trading partners.
    Recent published reports in Canada, quoting senior trade
sources, said the countries were close to reaching a trade deal
and it will involve eliminating border trariffs and many
non-tariff barriers over the next 10 to 12 years.
    It has been reported a key stumbling block in the talks is
a Canadian proposal to find a new way to settle trade disputes,
something that would give Canada protection from Washington's
tough trade remedy laws.
    But Mulroney, sharply critical of protectionist sentiment
in the U.S, said Canada was a "fair trader" and denied the
government was pursuing the deal to win unfair access to the
American market.
    He said a trade deal must bring benefits to both sides.
    "We recognize a good deal must be a fair deal, one that is
fair to both sides," Mulroney said.

february to 261 mln dlrs from January's 129 mln, but was  below
the 628 mln of February 1986, official figures show.
    The director of the Banco do Brasil's foreign trade
department (CACEX), Roberto Fendt, told reporters the upturn in
February confirmed a rising trend in exports, which totalled
1.53 billion dlrs against 1.26 billion in January and, after
excluding coffee and oil derivitives, was only slightly below
the same month last year.
    Coffee earnings were down to 110 mln dlrs against 295 mln

    Fendt said that although the February results were lower
than the average expected for the rest of the year, the
government's target of an eight-billion-dlr surplus for 1987
should be achieved. This would compare with a 1986 surplus of
9.5 billion dlrs.
    Exports this year are expected to total 22.5 billion dlrs
and imports 14.5 billion, he added. In 1986 exports totalled
22.4 billion dlrs and imports 12.9 billion.
    Fendt said the rise in imports in February to 1.27 billion
dlrs from 1.12 billion in February last year was in line with
government plans to foster economic growth.
    Fendt said that imports were running at levels well above
the traditional average for Brazil.
    In the first two months of the year imports, excluding oil
and wheat totalled, 1.8 billion dlrs against 1.47 billion in

    "It would not be sensible to provoke another dispute between

    "But some things are clear and they apply on both sides of
the Atlantic. We cannot continue to pile up stocks while world
demand shrinks," he said.
    "Governments must not operate farm policies as if they were
purely domestic affairs with no impact on others. They also
have to recognize that they cannot in the long run develop a
healthy and stable farm sector on the basis of protectionism
and excessive subisdies.
    "And above all, Europe and the United States have too many
common interests to make it worthwhile to engage in trade wars
and competitive export subsidies which end by benefitting no
one." He added, "It is crucial that the United States and the
European Community remain friends."

    Any unilateral U.S. moves would leave the EC no option but

of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) that South
Korea's five-year plan to cut its trade deficit with Japan
breaks GATT rules, Trade Ministry officials here said.
    They said Japan submitted a report earlier this month
alleging South Korea's plan to import less from Japan and more
from the U.S. And elsewhere was tantamount to creating
non-tariff trade barriers.
    South Korea unveiled the plan in November. It said it hoped
to narrow its trade deficit with Japan to two billion dlrs by
1991.
    South Korea's trade deficit with Japan was a record 5.45
billion dlrs in 1986, and rose to 752 mln dlrs in the first two
months of 1987 from 727 mln in the same 1986 period.
    The plan envisages giving incentives to importers not to
import Japanese goods, and to exporters to sell more to Japan.
    The officials said they believed the Japanese action, one
step short of filing a suit, was designed to bring South Korea
to the negotiating table and stop the plan.
    The Seoul government wants Tokyo to ease various import
restrictions and simplify customs inspections for South Korean
goods to help reduce the trade deficit.

U.S. That a U.S.-Japan pact on microchip trade is working ahead
of an April 1 deadline set by the U.S. For them to prove their
case.
    "We are implementing the agreement in good faith and the
situation does not run counter to the pact," Osamu Watanabe,
Director of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry's
(MITI) Americas and Oceanic Division, told foreign reporters.
    "The effects of the measures we have taken and are taking
are emerging in the market place," he said.
    U.S. Trade officials have repeatedly accused Japanese
microchip makers of violating the pact by continuing to sell at
below cost in markets outside Japan and the United States.
    The agreement, signed last September, aimed at halting
predatory Japanese pricing policies and increasing U.S.
Semiconductor firms' access to the Japanese market.
    The comments by MITI officials followed a call by Prime
Minsiter Yasuhiro Nakasone to clear up any misunderstandings on
the U.S. Side about the pact, Watanabe said.
    Yukio Honda, director of MITI's Industrial Electronics
Division, denied that Japanese chipmakers were selling at below
cost in third countries.
    MITI's call to Japanese chip makers last month to cut
production of key memory chips in the first quarter of this
year has begun to dry up the source of cheap chips for sale in
the non-regulated grey market, Honda said.
    "The grey market exports from Japan are shrinking now, but
in contrast U.S. And South Korean companies are expanding
market share because of their cheaper prices," Honda said.
    MITI plans to take further steps to reduce the excess
supply of inexpensive chips which developed in Japan after the
pact was formed because of a slump in Japanese semiconductor
exports to the United States, he added.
    The ministry will soon release its supply-demand guidelines
for the second quarter and suggested production volumes are
likely to be lower than that for the first quarter, he said.
    Despite businessmen's ingenuity in finding ways around any
artificial controls, regulation of supply and demand should
bring positive results, Watanabe said. "I am optimistic," he
added.

    "If we ask ourselves whether it is perhaps inevitable that

then I think the answer is probably yes," he said.
    In order to reduce these tensions, decision-making in the

pressure groups of the need for accommodation, he added.

said an agreement has been reached by members of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to
control the unfair trade practice of using tied aid to promote
trade.
    He said in a statement the agreement culminates the Reagan
administration's effot to negotiate a virtual end to export
credit subsidies.
    The practice of other governments using tied aid or mixed
credits to promote exports has cost the United States lost jobs
and lost exports, the Treasury said.
    The agreement to be implemented in two stages by July, 1988
would ban tied aid credit among industrialized countries and
place limits on permitted aid by developing countries.
    It would also reduce export credits that do not involve aid
and reduce credit subsidies permitted for relatively poor
countries, the Treasury said.
    Baker said the agreement imposes particular sacrifices on
Japan and praised Japan's willingness to accept the pact as a
demonstration of the Japanese government's willingness to take
concrete steps to resolve important trade issues.

agreed reforms in rules by which they provide credit for
exports to developing countries, the Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development said.
    The reforms tighten the rules for the use of foreign aid to
subsidise export credits in so-called "mixed credits," the OECD
said.
    The agreement, to be implemented in two stages in July this
year and July 1988, means the minimum aid component in mixed
credits will be raised to 35 pct from 25 pct, and to 50 pct for
credits covering exports to the world's least developed
nations.
    Additionally, a new formula will be used for calculating
the aid element in mixed credits, to take account of different
interest rates in the exporting countries, the 24-nation OECD,
which hosted the reform negotiations, said.
    Minimum interest rates for officially subsidised trade
loans have also been revised with the aim of cutting the
subsidies, and ending them completely on loans to relatively
rich developing countries by July next year.
    The reforms follow several years of pressure by the U.S. To
stop competitors, notably France and Japan, using foreign aid
to subsidise exports, putting U.S. Firms at a disadvantage.
    OECD officials said the agreement was based on a
provisional accord reached in January subject to ratification
by member governments. Some governments, including Austria, had
linked their final approval to other trade credit issues which
would be discussed at a meeting here in mid-April, they added.
    By raising the minimum amount of aid required in mixed
credits the agreement aims to make such hidden subsidies too
costly for frequent use.
    "A major loophole in the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade has been closed today," a senior U.S. Official here
commented.

warned the U.S. House of Representatives that tough trade
legislation it is considering could prompt retaliation by U.S.
trading partners.
    The warning was sent in a letter from Sir Roy Denman, head
of the EC delegation in Washington, to Dan Rostenkowski,
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.
    A copy of the letter was made available to Reuters.
    Denman told Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat, he backed
aspects of the bill, such as one backing new talks under the
GATT and one excluding protection for the textile industry.
    But Denman disagreed with other provisions which would
require President Reagan to take retaliatory trade action
against nations with large trade surpluses with the U.S. and
would set new standards for judging unfair foreign trade
practices.
    Denman told Rostenkowski that GATT regulations prohibit
member nations from taking unilateral retaliatory action in
trade disputes unless the action is GATT-approved.
    He said "If the Congress makes retaliatory action mandatory,
then the United States would be in violation of its
international legal obligations and on a collision course with
its major trading partners."
    Denman added that a president should have flexibility in
enforcing trade laws, saying "in the last resort, any
administration must take its decision in light of the overall
national interest."
    Otherwise, he said, "the risk would be counter-reaction by
trading partners of the United States, i.e., retaliation or
enactment of mirror image legislation to be employed against
imports from the United States."
    Denman also said Congress could prompt retaliation if it
reduced the threshhold of unfair trade by making it easier for
firms to file unfair trade practice claims.
    Retaliation could also be prompted by relaxing standards
for findings that imports were injuring U.S. firms.
    "Changes in these standards must be agreed upon
multilaterally. They cannot be imposed by the United States
alone on the world trading system," he said.
    House leaders have rejected a plan by textile-state
legislators to add to the trade bill a provision to curb
imports of cloth and clothing, similar to a measure passed two
years ago but vetoed by President Reagan.
    There was concern by the leaders that Reagan would veto the
entire trade bill because of the textile amendment.

ease government controls on exports as several House committees
moved rapidly toward approval of major changes in trade laws
they hope will help solve U.S. trade woes.
    The House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on International
Economic Policy voted to direct the administration to cut the
list of controlled exports by 40 per cent by removing items no
longer considered important to U.S. military security.
    Industries had complained they were losing sales to foreign
competitors who were allowed to export freely products U.S.
companies could not sell abroad.
    The issue has been the subject of administration debate.
The Commerce Department had held that unnecessary restrictions
impeded U.S. exports while the Defense Department said current
controls should be retained but better administered.
    Four congressional panels met today to consider portions of
a wideranging trade bill that intends to help U.S. companies
sell more products abroad and to fight unfair foreign trade
practices.
    Their separate proposals, some of them conflicting, will be
woven by House Democratic leaders into a final trade bill for a
vote by the full House in late April.
    Sparked by the proposal of Fujitsu Ltd. to take controlling
interest in Schlumberger Ltd's Fairchild Semiconductor Corp.,
the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on Commerce voted to
expand Reagan's authority to block foreign takeovers of U.S.
companies.
    Reagan would be able to block any takeover found to be
damaging to U.S. economic or national security interests.
    "We are losing our semiconductors which are at the heart of
our national security," subcommittee chairman James Florio, a
New Jersey Democrat said.
    The subcommittee also called for the administration to
consider retaliation against Japan for its restrictive
government procurement practices.
    The retaliation could be triggered by a requirement that
the administration investigate whether U.S. companies were
treated unfairly and whether they have been barred from bids on
lucrative public works projects such as the eight billion dlr
Kansai airport construction. U.S. firms have complained they
were not allowed to bid on its construction.
    At the urging of the U.S. recording industry, the
subcommittee agreed to bar imports of a new Japanese
product--digital audio recorders.
    Meeting in closed session, the House Ways and Means
Committee agreed to allow President Reagan to retaliate against
foreign countries that refuse to open their markets to U.S.
telecommunications products.
     Congressional aides said the committee also agreed U.S.
companies would be allowed to press for relief from imports of
counterfeit products made in violation of U.S. copyright and
patent laws.

Industry will ask Japanese computer microchip makers to further
slash output in the second quarter in an effort to save its
semiconductor pact with the United States, MITI officials said.
    The United States has accused Japan of reneging on the
semiconductor pact by failing to stop the flow of cut-price
Japanese chips to Asian markets. Washington has threatened to
take retaliatory action after April 1.
    The pact, agreed last year, calls on Japan to stop selling
cut-price chips in world markets and to increase its imports of
American chips to reduce some of its huge trade surplus.
    MITI, anxious to salvage the bilateral agreement, has been
pressing chip makers to limit production in the hope that will
boost domestic chip prices and reduce the incentive to export.
    Last month, the ministry asked Japanese chip makers to
reduce first quarter output by 10 pct. To meet that request,
they had to slash production by 20 pct over the final six weeks
of the first quarter.
    If that reduced production level were maintained through to
the end of June, second quarter output would come in 10 pct
below that of the first three months of the year.
    MITI officials, who declined to be identified, said the
ministry has not yet decided on the extent of the second
quarter cutback.
    One said that Japanese chip makers are losing ground in
Asia to South Korean and U.S. Competition just as markets there

 ]]></BODY><BODY><![CDATA[The U.S. trade deficit with Taiwan and
Korea is expected to widen this year, despite some economic and
currency adjustments by the two newly industrialized countries,
economists said.
    "The surpluses that Taiwan and Korea ran with the U.S. in
1986 will get bigger. This time next year, the U.S. will be
screaming at those countries about their exports," said Steve
Cerier of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.
    Taiwan is currently the third biggest exporter to the U.S.
after Japan and Canada, while Korea is the seventh largest.
    Faced with heightened protectionist sentiment in Congress,
the Reagan administration has been stepping up the rhetoric
against Taiwan and Korea, urging those countries to allow their
currencies to appreciate and lift impediments to free trade.
    The thrust has shifted to those newly industrialized
countries (NICs) amid signs the dollar's steep drop against the
currencies of Japan and most EC nations -- previously the main
focus of the U.S. drive to cut its trade gap -- is beginning to
close the competiveness gap for American goods.
    U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker said recently that he
expects a reduction in Japan's trade surplus this year.
    But U.S. manufacturers still are losing markets on their
own doorstep to Taiwan and Korea, whose currencies have not
risen as much as the yen and the mark. As major beneficiaries
of soft oil prices and with low labor costs, Taiwanese and
Korean exporters are well-placed to take up the slack.
    "In 1986, the fashionable comment in Washington was
Japan-bashing. Now it's NIC-bashing," said Robert Chandross, of
Lloyds Bank PLC.
    Asia's four main NICs -- Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore
and Taiwan -- accounted for almost one-fifth of the overall 170
billion dlr U.S. merchandise trade deficit for 1986.
    The U.S. trade gap with Taiwan rose to 15.7 billion dlrs in
1986 from 13.1 billion in 1985, while the bilateral trade
deficit with South Korea grew to 7.1 billion from 4.8 billion.
    And preliminary U.S. data show that the growth trend is
continuing. The U.S. trade shortfall with Taiwan was 1.6
billion dlrs in January, up 24.4 pct from a year earlier. The
gap with Korea was 700 mln dlrs, up 24.8 pct from a year ago.
    Lately both nations have said they will take steps to
defuse incipient trade tensions. Korea said it is choosing many
of the 122 items on which the U.S. wants it to cut import
tariffs in order to deflect pressure for currency revaluation.
    Still, South Korean trade minister Rha Woong Bae said last
week that Korea would maintain a trade surplus for three to
five years as a way to cut its 44.5 billion dlr foreign debt.
    For its part, Taiwan said in January that it will cut
tariffs on 1,700 goods sometime in the second half of 1987 and
try to diversify exports. But vice economic minister Wang
Chien-Shien said last month that he still does not expect
Taiwan's trade surplus with the U.S. will fall in 1987.
    The NICs have made deep inroads into markets for textiles
and electronic goods. But Korea is raising its profile in the
area of "big-ticket" manufactured goods, notably cars.
    Korea expects its auto exports -- mostly for North America
-- to balloon to 675,000 units in 1987 from zero in 1985.
    "The NICs' exports are almost all manufactured goods. When
their exports rise it hits the heart of the U.S. manufacturing
base. It cuts directly to us and to our customers," said Bob
Wendt, manager for economic studies at Bethlehem Steel Corp.
    The U.S. takes 90 pct of Korea's computer products exports,
72 pct of its electrical appliances and 65 pct of its
telecommunications equipment.
    A recent study by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co says Taiwan and
South Korea are the most pressing trade issue for the U.S.
    While Hong Kong and Singapore run trade surpluses with the
U.S., these are offset by their deficits with other countries.
    But Taiwan and, to a lesser extent, South Korea, stand in
marked contrast. Both of these nations have moved rapidly into
large bilateral surplus with the U.S. and major overrall trade
and current account surpluses, the Morgan study says.
    Morgan expects Taiwan's overall trade surplus to grow to
18.5 billion dlrs in 1987 from 15.2 billion last year, and
Korea's to increase to 6.5 billion dlrs from 3.5 billion.
    Concern about the NICs is not confined to the U.S.
    "A lot of Korea and Taiwan's exports to the U.S. have been
at Japan's expense," said Richard Koss at General Motors Corp.
    February's Paris meeting of six major industrial powers
exorted NICs to lower trade barriers and revalue currencies.
    But this two-pronged approach has drawn little response
from the two nations so far and, in any case, will only work
with a sizeable lag, economists say.
    The U.S. has not said how much it thinks the Taiwan's and
Korea's currencies should climb. The Taiwan dollar, which is
pegged to the U.S. dollar, has risen about 15 pct since
September 1985 while the Korean won has risen about five pct.
    But in real terms the Taiwan dollar has been flat against
the U.S. unit and the won has lost seven pct, economists say.
    "We've not seen any lessening of competition from those
countries that we can attribute to currency changes," said
Bethlehem Steel's Wendt.
    And so far, U.S. pleas for Taiwan and Korea to use their
hefty export earnings to import more have had little effect.
    Moreover, it is uncertain how far U.S. protectionism will
get given the administration's free-trade stance. "It's hard to
see that anything will be passed much before year-end. And then
the question is, will it have teeth?" one economist said.

is a misguided attempt to deal with the nation's trade deficit
and will spark retaliation if passed in its present form.
    "To think that you can deal with a trade deficit by
legislation is a mistake," he told the Foreign Trade
Association here.
    Denman told reporters that possible retaliation, which he
warned of in a letter to House Ways and Means Committee
Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, would not necessarily be on a
product-for-product basis.
    "Retaliation does not have to be matched product to
product," Denman said.
    He said in the case of textiles import restrictions,
however, retaliation would be against U.S. textile exports.
    "Certainly, if restrictions were imposed on European
exports of textiles to the U.S., the Community would be likely
to retaliate with restrictions on U.S. textile exports to
Europe," Denman said.
    He also took exception to U.S. proposals to require
countries with large current account surpluses with the U.S. to
cut those surpluses or face special tariffs.
    "This would conflict with international obligations, throw
a large wrench into the current round of trade negotiations and
could easily boomerang," he warned of the tariff proposals.
    Denman also took exception to U.S. efforts to seek
reciprocity in specific trade sectors.
    "Forcing reciprocity in one sector by imposing barriers
would simply lead to retaliation from the other party," he
said, adding that overall reciprocity can only be achieved by
trading off disadvantages in one sector for advantages in
another.

said a study of agriculture subsidies by the Organisation for
Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, is still under way
and will be completed sometime next month.
    The officials said the study has been inaccurate so far,
and they said Japan would comment on the final results.
    A Reuter report from Washington yesterday said the study
has found that Japan has the highest agriculture subsidies in
the world and that dairy farmers benefit more than any other
commodity producers from subsidies. The study has not been
officially released due to objections from some countries.
    Japan has withdrawn its objection and decided to accept the
release of the study, the agriculture ministry officials said.
OECD directors are expected to approve the release at a meeting
in mid-May.
    One agriculture ministry source said the study so far was
based on the years 1979-81. Japanese subsidies have dropped
sharply since then, partly because of tight budgetary policy,
and foreign currency factors have also changed, he said.
    "The study is ... Unfair and unacceptable because it does
not take account of various differences in farming conditions
in each country, such as geography," the source said.
    He said it is highly likely that the final study will show
Japan has the highest farm subsidies in the world.
    "This would increase foreign pressure to open Japan's farm
market further, but this would have little impact on Japan's
agriculture policy," he said, without giving further details.
    A main purpose of the study is to clarify export subsidies
by major exporting nations like the United States and the
European Community, but Japan is a major importer, he said.

Soviet-led Comecon ended talks here, having made progress on
setting up formal trade relations, but no breakthrough because
of Comecon's refusal to recognise West Berlin as part of the
EC, delegates said.
    Negotiators were trying to reach agreement on the draft of
a joint declaration setting up official relations after 30
years of mutual non-recognition. John Maslen, head of the EC
delegation, told Reuters as he emerged from the final session:
"We made some progress, but we have called for another meeting."
    Officials, who asked not to be named, said the Comecon team
had refused to accept a clause in the draft declaration which
would recognise West Berlin as part of the 12-nation EC.
    Under the 1957 Treaty of Rome all contracts and agreements
signed by the Community must contain this territorial clause
stipulating West Berlin is an integral part of the EC. An EC
negotiator taking part in the three-day talks said: "We wanted
the territorial clause in, but Comecon said no."
    A joint statement issued after the talks said progress was
made towards clarifying positions, but another meeting would be
necessary to complete the work.
    Any decision in principle to set up relations would require
approval by the Community's Council of Ministers and by the
executive committee of Comecon.
    Zdzislaw Kuroski, deputy director of Comecon, who heads the
East bloc delegation, told Reuters ahead of today's session: "We
have narrowed our differences on a range of questions, but not
on all questions."
    Asked whether Comecon would accept EC insistence that any
joint declaration stipulate West Berlin as part of the
Community, he replied: "This question is not contained in the
draft which our side presented."
    West German diplomats said they would insist on including
the clause on West Berlin in any EC-Comecon agreement.
    The talks followed an earlier round between the two trading
blocs here last September and the first-ever direct talks
between the EC and the Soviet Union on establishing diplomatic
relations in January.
    The EC trades with individual Comecon member states despite
non-recognition of Comecon. Last year, the EC had a five
billion dlr trade deficit with East European states, about half
the deficit of the previous year, due to a drop in the price of
Soviet oil imported by the EC.

    Commission officials did not rule out retaliatory measures
if, after a GATT decision against it, Washington failed to
bring the disputed section into line with international rules.
    The executive's decision to go to GATT follows a complaint
to it by the Dutch company Akzo <AKZO.AS>, whose "aramid"
synthetic fibres have been banned from the U.S. Market because
of charges by the U.S. Firm <Dupont> that the fibres violate
the American company's patents.
    Akzo alleged that the ban, imposed by the U.S.
International Trade Commission (ITC), was discriminatory and
incompatible with GATT provisions.
    The dispute centres on the fact that section 337 of the
U.S. Tariff Act gives the ITC jurisdiction  over imported
products. The EC Commission charged that EC producers did not
have the same possibilities for defending themselves before the
ITC as they would have in a normal U.S. Court.
    "Consequently the procedure followed...Is less favourable
than that which takes places in normal courts of law for goods
produced in the United States," it said in a statement.

European governments unfairly subsidise the Airbus Industrie
aircraft consortium in proceedings at the GATT civil aircraft
committee, a GATT spokesman said today.
    The U.S. Presented its case for the first time to the
aircraft committee of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (GATT) during a special two-day session ending today.
GATT rules cover some 80 pct of world commerce.
    The 20-member committee agreed to open debate on the U.S.
Complaint, starting with informal consultations and then
holding a special session in July, trade officials said.
    "The tension has eased," the permanent trade ambassador of
the 12-member European Community Tran Van Thinh told reporters.
"The U.S. Has decided to go through proper channels."
    U.S. Trade officials again made clear their anger over what
they call unfair government support for Airbus, voiced during a
visit to European capitals in February.
    In a letter calling for the special committee meeting,
Washington charged France, West Germany, the U.K., Spain and
the EC Commission with unfair practices on behalf of Airbus.
    The U.S. Charges that the Europeans are violating rules
laid down in the 1979 Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft.
    Washington presented its reading of rules on inducement to
purchase aircraft and support for development of airlines
during the special session and asked the committee to confirm
its view.
    Official sources in the delegations said the U.S. Views
would be considered during the informal consultations but the
Europeans would also be free to bring up any complaints against
American civil aircraft practices.
    Some delegates said the U.S. Position appeared to give such
broad interpretation to the rules as to suggest that the civil
aircraft accord needed re-negotiating. All these matters would
be considered during the informal meetings.

American-caught herring and pollock, opening the way for
shipments that could reach 300 mln dlrs annually, U.S. Trade
Representative Clayton Yeutter announced.
    Yeutter said the accord was reached after extensive
bilateral negotiations that ended earlier today in Tokyo.
    He said the Commerce Department estimated U.S. shipments of
processed pollock products and herring should rise to 85 mln
dlrs this year and to more than 300 mln dlrs annually in later
years.
    There was no immediate assessment of the value of current
U.S. shipments, but officials said the pact would lift quotas
to the point that Americans would be able to ship nearly all
the pollock and herring ordered by Japanese firms.
    At the same time, Yeutter said Washington was temporarily
suspending a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (GATT) that Japan was unfairly curbing imports of the
two fish.
    He said the complaint would be reviewed later this year
after an assessment to see if Japan lived up to the agreement.

facing U.S.-Canadian relations because of a pressing need to
reach a new bilateral pact within the coming months, Joe Clark,
Canadian secretary of state for external affairs, said.
    Negotiators for the two countries have been meeting for
more than a year in an effort to work out an agreement.
    "The most urgent problem now is the trade question because
that has to be decided within the next 10 months," Clark told
the Commonwealth Club of California. "We have a fast track
authority from your Congress for approval or rejection of
whatever the negotiators achieve."
    Clark said that, as a practical matter, an initial
agreement must be reached by late September or early October.
    He listed environmental questions, particularly acid rain,
and defense as the second and third most important bilateral
issues facing Ottawa and Washington.
    On Wednesday, President Reagan announced that he will seek
2.5 billion dlrs from Congress to address the acid rain
problem. Some interpreted the move as a goodwill gesture in
advance of his annual meeting, on April 5-6 in Ottawa, with
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.
    In a question-and-answer session with the public affairs
group, Clark said that the two countries must find better
mechanisms for resolving their trade disputes.
    "This rash of countervailing actions, where we acted on
corn and you acted on soft wood and we both said they were
quasijudicial -- the dispute resolution mechanisims in place
now are not working adequately in either of our interests," he
said.
    Ottawa also is seeking to change some of Washington's rules
on government procurement that penalize Canadian businesses, he
said.
    "There are a number of Canadian companies that, in order to
secure substantial contracts in the United States, have had to
move their head offices out of our country into your country
because you have national procurement requirements," he said.
    In turn, he added, the United States would like to change
some of the procurement requirements that exist at the
provincial government level in Canada.
    Clark declined to forecast the outcome of the discussions.
    "What will come out of it remains for the negotiators, in
the first instance, to propose, and then governments and
congresses will have judge," he said.
    In his prepared remarks, Clark said that the United States
has tended to take Canada for granted, although it exports to
its northern neighbor more than twice what it exports to Japan.
"Yet you bought almost 10 per cent more from Japan last year
than you bought from Canada," he said. REUTER

sanctions soon on imports of Japanese microchips, senators said
today after a private meeting with Commerce Secretary Malcolm
Baldrige.
    Although the senators said Baldrige told them no decision
would be taken until a final determination is made on whether
Japanese microchips were dumped in the United States, they said
they were virtually sure Japan would face penalties.
    President Reagan's trade policy advisory group, of which
Baldrige is a member, will meet on the issue Wednesday.
    "I am confident we will see action taken," Sen. John McCain,
an Arizona Republican, told reporters.
    "I am expecting sanctions at least, and even more than
sanctions," Sen. Pete Domenici, a New Mexico Republican, said.
    The senators, several congressmen and U.S. semiconductor
industry representatives met with Baldrige and State Department
officials to discuss Japan's alleged violations of a September
1986 agreement to stop dumping its microchips in the United
States and other countries.
    They recommended Japanese firms be penalized through
tariffs or import duties over the next six to 12 months for
continuing to dump microchips. The violations were worth 100
mln dls to the Japanese semiconductor industry, they said.
    Asked if Baldrige intended to recommend sanctions, Sen.
Pete Wilson told reporters, "The clear import of what he said is
that there will be."
    "Japan can't just say they will comply. We think sanctions
must be applied," for past violations of the agreement, the
California Republican said.
    The semiconductor industry produces microprocessor chips
which are used in high technology products ranging from radios
to defence missile guidance systems.
    Sen. James McClure, an Idaho Republican, said Baldrige told
them the administration had not made a final determination that
Japanese companies had dumped semiconductor microchips below
the cost of production in the United States or other countries.
    But McClure said senators told him, "There is no doubt
dumping is going on," based on evidence such as invoices of
purchases of the Japanese products.
    The two countries signed a pact last September in which
Japan agreed to stop selling its microchips in the United
States and other countries below production costs and to allow
the U.S. semiconductor industry access to the Japanese market.
    In return, the United States waived its right to impose
import duties on the Japanese microchips.
    Japanese officials have said they have lived up to the pact
and have asked Japanese chip-makers to further slash output to
save the pact.
    Japan has frequently been the target of congressional
discouragement over last year's record 169-billion-dlr trade
deficit. Tokyo had a 59-billion-dlr surplus with the United
States last year and had large surpluses with other countries.
    The Senate yesterday unanimously passed a resolution
calling for action against Japan for violations of the pact
since September. The resolution will be introduced in the House
next week by Rep. Bob Matsui, a California Democrat.

nations were told by New Zealand that the next international
negotiations on liberalising trade would be the last this
century and the cost of failure could not be measured.
    Trade minister Mike Moore told his colleagues at a
welcoming ceremony before two days of talks here that great
progress had been made in preparing for the negotiations which
must not be sidetracked.
    "We live in troubled and dangerous times for the world
trading system," he said.
    "We have seen that the failure of the world trading system
has caused great depression and conflict in the past. Our
failure to maintain the momentum will be at great cost to us
all," Moore said.
    He added: "The cost of failure is beyond calculation. It is
our last hope and best opportunity this century. We will not
get another chance before the year 2000."
    The ministers are in New Zealand to review world trade
since the "Uruguay round" talks last Sepember. The meeting is
also part of preparations for a full-scale conference of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Venice in
June.
    The Uruguay meeting is considered by most countries to have
been particularly successful, with northern hemisphere
countries managing to have service industries such as banking
and insurance included in the next full round.
    The southerners' goal of including agricultural and
tropical products also was met.
    The meeting at this North Island tourist resort is
described by participants as informal and no declaration is
expected.
    Moore said one aim was to "instil a sense of political
urgency to avert potential economic tragedy."
    Another was to seek ways of popularising freer trade to
people who felt the pain of readjustment but could not see the
benefits, as well as preventing "bush fires of confrontation
while we proceed with orderly negotiations."
    The meeting is being attended by 25 overseas delegations
including representatives of GATT and the Economic Community.
    The delegates include U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
Yeutter.
    American sources say he is ready to state that the best way
to reverse protectionist sentiment in the United States is to
implement four key Uruguay proposals:
    -- an end to agricultural subsidies;
    -- inclusion of trade in services and investments in GATT
regulations;
    -- tightening of restrictions on pirating of so-called
intellectual property such as trademarks, patents and
copyrights;
    -- new rules to resolve trade disputes among GATT's 92
member states.

for domestic political reasons.

protectionist."
    "Members of Congress, that is the contemplative members of
Congress, have begun to realise protectionism is not the answer
to the 170 billion dlr trade deficit," Yeutter said.
    "They've also begun to realise that you cannot legislate
solutions to a 170 billion dollar trade deficit so they are
more realistic and, in my judgement, more responsible on that
issue than they were 12 or 18 months ago."

of trade ministers it is making every effort to expand domestic
demand and restructure its economy.
    Japanese trade representative Tsomu Hata told an informal
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) meeting that, in
addition to demand boosting measures adopted last September, a
comprehensive economic program will be prepared after the
1987/88 budget is approved.
    Hata, speaking at the first session of the two-day meeting,
said agriculture is no exception to the goal of restructuring
the economy, but did not elaborate.
    Hata said protectionist pressures in the international
economy are as strong as ever, reflecting financial deficits,
payment imbalances and serious unemployment in many countries.
    Despite great potential, developing economies are still
confronted by grave difficulties, particularly debt, he added.
    The basis for the talks is the GATT ministerial declaration
last September in Punta del Este, Uruguay, and the subsequent
trade negotiating plan agreed in Geneva.
    "It is essential that we first reaffirm here our commitment
to implementing that plan as scheduled," Hata said.
    Hata added it is not constructive to speed up negotiations
in some areas at the expense of others.
    In order to rebuild the free trade system, it is important
for each participant to have domestic policies that will serve
this end.
    As part of its contribution, Japan plans in April to
fundamentally improve its generalised system of preferences for
industrial and mining products to make Japan's domestic market
more open to developing countries, he said.

John Dawkins said if the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT) does not give high priority to agricultural trade reform
it will be neglecting the area of greatest crisis.
    In a statement to the informal GATT trade ministers
conference here he said agriculture is a problem which involves
all countries and seriously affects the debt servicing
abilities of a number of developing countries.
     He said major countries should be showing leadership on
this problem.
    "We will be giving close attention to the processes in the
OECD (Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development) and
elsewhere leading to the Venice economic summit where we will
be looking to the participants to adopt a strong commitment to
agricultural trade reform," Dawkins said.
    The Venice summit is scheduled for June.
    He said Australia's interests in the Uruguay Round, the
eighth under the GATT, are wide ranging. Dawkins said he sees
the round as providing a timely opportunity to secure further
meaningful trade liberalisation in all sectors and to restore
confidence in the multilateral system.
    Dawkins said initial meetings of the negotiating groups
established in Geneva after the GATT declaration last September
in Punta del Este, Uruguay, have made a reasonable start, but
it is vital that trade ministers maintain the pressure on these
processes.
    "We must see that the commitments made at Punta del Este on
standstill and rollback are carried into practice."
    The standstill and rollback of protection offers the global
trading system a chance to hold and wind back protection during
the negotiations which are expected to last up to four years,
he said.

salvage its computer micro-chip pact with the United States -
sending a letter to top American policy makers setting out its
case and instructing its producers to cut output further.
    "We must make our utmost effort to ward off any catastrophe,"
Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) Deputy
Director General Masaji Yamamoto told reporters.
    "If hasty action is taken in the United States, it will
create very serious problems."
    The Reagan Administration's Economic Policy is expected to
meet Thursday to review Japanese compliance with the bilateral
agreement hammered out last year. Under the pact, Tokyo agreed
to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to
increase its imports of American semiconductors.
    Washington has accused Japan of reneging on the deal by
selling low priced chips in Asia and by failing to boost
American imports, and has threatened to take retaliatory
action.
    In an effort to save the agreement, MITI is asking Japanese
chip makers to limit production in the hope that will boost
domestic demand and reduce the incentive to export.
    Yamamoto said that Japan will slash output of 256 kilobit
dynamic random access and erasable programmable read only
memory chips by 11 pct in the second quarter. This follows a
cutback of more than 20 pct in the first three months of the
year.
    He said the cutbacks were already drying up the supply of
chips available for export through unregulated distributors in
the so-called grey market.
    "We have almost no grey market," he said. "Supply is
diminishing."
    To help ensure that the cutbacks are implemented, MITI
called in the president of Japan's largest semiconductor maker,
NEC Corp <NIPN.T> last week, he said. It is also issuing
specific instructions on production to the Japanese subsidiary
of <Texas Instruments Inc>.
    Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura spelled out the
steps Japan was taking to salvage the pact and appealed for
U.S. Understanding in a letter to top American policy makers.
    The letter was sent today to U.S. Secretary of State George
Schultz, Treasury Secretary James Baker, Commerce Secretary
Malcolm Baldrige and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter.
    The four, who make up the Economic Policy Council, are
expected to consider evidence presented by U.S. Chip maker
Micron Technology Inc <DRAM.O> of cut-price Japanese sales in
Hong Kong.
    Yamamoto admitted that <Oki Electric Industry Co>'s Hong
Kong subsidiary had sold chips at an inappropriate level but
denied that it was dumping chips at rock-bottom prices.
    "If the United States uses this as proof of dumping...We
will present our rebuttal," he said.
    The sales though were inappropriate in the light of MITI's
advice to semiconductor makers to sell chips at well above
production costs to avoid any hint of dumping, he said.
    He also called the case "strange," but he stopped short of
endorsing Japanese newspaper accusations that Oki had been
trapped into making the sales. He did say though that Micron
publicized the invoice documenting the sales on the same day
they were made and that Oki was unable to locate the person who
had bought the chips when it tried to buy them back last week.

Clayton Yeutter said trade ministers meeting here have reached
a general consensus on agricultural trade reform under the
latest Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (GATT).
    Yeutter gave no precise details of the understanding but
told journalists the consensus covers the principles involved
in agricultural trade reform and what needs to be done to
improve the global situation in agriculture.
    Delegates from 22 countries are meeting informally to
discuss progress made since the latest GATT round was launched
in Punta del Este, Uruguay, last September.
    Yeutter said "at least people seem to be going down the same
road...But how that translates ultimately into negotiations is
another matter entirely."
    There seems to be an understanding of the need to deal with
the problem quickly and "a more common understanding of how we
are going to get from here to there," Yeutter said.
    However, the hard work is still to come, with a couple of
years of tough negotiations ahead, he said.
    "It is ludicrous for the nations of the world to plough
immense amounts of financial resources into the production of
items that nobody wants to buy," he said.
    He said the long-term answer is to switch some of the
financial resources now committed to agriculture to other more
productive areas. This would help agriculture because some its
inefficient non-productive segments would stop operating, he
said.
    Individual segments in many countries may lose in the
process, but it should result in a more rational system of

    It is important that the agriculture negotiations reach a
relatively early conclusion because the U.S. Is spending 26

trade reform) done in two to three years it's going to have to
be as part of a larger package."

(General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) round is needed to
halt growing bilateral trade problems between major trading
partners, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said.
    Yeutter, in New Zealand for informal GATT ministerial
talks, told Reuters bilateral trade disputes are increasing
because the multilateral system is inefficient.
    "That is really a strong rationale why we need a new GATT
round," he said. "The very existence of all these bilateral
irritants clearly emphasises the need to develop multilateral
solutions to some of these problems."
    The eighth GATT round of negotiations was launched at Punta
del Este in Uruguay in September 1986. Agriculture and services
were included in the negotiations for the first time.
    The growing debt burden of Latin American and African
nations will also provide impetus for the GATT round to
succeed, he said.
    "Clearly those countries need to develop their export
endeavours and they need open markets for that to happen and
that's the basic objective of the new GATT round," he said.
    But he said the GATT round is a long term endeavour. It
will not give any short term relief for debt ridden countries,
but it will make a difference in 10 to 15 years.
    "It's a worthwhile activity from their standpoint because
these debts are not going to go away in the next year or two,"
he said.
    "They ought to be very strongly supported in the GATT round
as a mechanism for relieving their debt burdens or making
possible debt amortisation in the future," he said.

intervened to try to resolve Japan's escalating dispute with
the U.S. Over semiconductor trade, government officials said.
    At today's Cabinet meeting, Nakasone told Trade and
Industry Minister Hajime Tamura to redouble his efforts to calm
U.S. Anger over what it sees as Japan's unfair trade practices
in semiconductors.
    Nakasone intervened only two days before a scheduled
meeting of the Reagan administration's Economic Policy Council
to consider whether Japan is reneging on its microchip pact
with the U.S.
    That pact, agreed last year after months of negotiations,
calls on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets
and to raise its imports of U.S. Semiconductors.
    Senior U.S. Officials have accused Tokyo of failing to live
up to the accord and have threatened retaliatory action.
    Yesterday, Tamura's Ministry of International Trade and
Industry (MITI) launched a last-ditch attempt to salvage the
pact by writing letters to U.S. Policy makers setting out
Japan's case and telling Japanese chip makers to cut output.
    In his letter, the contents of which were released today,
Tamura said a MITI survey carried out at the beginning of March
showed Japanese producers were not selling at cut-rate prices
in Asian markets.
    In a separate letter sent to senior U.S. Officials, MITI
vice minister for international affairs Makoto Kuroda suggested
the two countries could conduct a joint investigation into

Carney said that agricultural policies should not hurt world
international trade and should therefore become more price
responsive over time.
    She told delegates at the informal meeting of trade
ministers that this was one of five principles Canada wanted
adopted in reforming agriculture in the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Secondly, support for agriculture
should avoid production incentives, and thirdly, countries
should freeze and seek to reduce government aid measures that
distorted world prices, Carney said.
    Carney said the fourth principle was that countries should
not introduce new import barriers not mandated by existing
legislation and the fifth was that these basic principles must
be implemented collectively.
    Carney later told Reuters the Canadian guidelines are
basically compatible with the seven point Australian proposals
announced in Davos, Switzerland, in January.
    European trade sources said the conference welcomed the
Canadian initiative but some delegates, and not only the
European Community, voiced reservations about some of the
principles.
    Carney said there was a lot of political will among the
ministers here to complete the Uruguay Round of GATT in under
four years and that there is also a realisation that it has to
be done in a balanced way.
    "The consensus view was to proceed as fast as we can on a

doubts about agreements produced at international conferences,
said he was pleased with the latest gathering here.
    Concepcion told Reuters in an interview that the informal
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) meeting gave
ministers from more than 20 nations the chance to examine
issues with which GATT did not have the political will to deal.
    "Also, the role of the developing countries has been
emphasised in this particular meeting. Somehow it has been the
perception of developing countries that GATT is a club of rich
countries," he added in an interview with Reuters.
    "In fact many of the issues that have been tabled for
discussion (in the Uruguay round of trade negotiations) will be
of more benefit to the developed countries," he said.
    Concepcion said at the start of the Taupo meeting that the
Uruguay round was meant to be a "shining act of faith" in the
world trade system.
    Concepcion said the Philippines would address the issues of
trade in tropical fruit and the improvement of GATT machinery
to make it more responsive.
    He said tropical fruit came from developing countries but
faced non-tariff barriers, quantitative restrictions or very
high duties in other nations. Concepcion named Japan and South

Clayton Yeutter said trade ministers meeting here have reached
a general consensus on agricultural trade reform under the
latest Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (GATT).
    Yeutter gave no precise details of the understanding but
told journalists the consensus covers the principles involved
in agricultural trade reform and what needs to be done to
improve the global situation in agriculture.
    Delegates from 22 countries are meeting informally to
discuss progress made since the latest GATT round was launched
in Punta del Este, Uruguay, last September.
    Yeutter said "at least people seem to be going down the same
road...But how that translates ultimately into negotiations is
another matter entirely."
    There seems to be an understanding of the need to deal with
the problem quickly and "a more common understanding of how we
are going to get from here to there," Yeutter said.
    However, the hard work is still to come, with a couple of
years of tough negotiations ahead, he said.
    "It is ludicrous for the nations of the world to plough
immense amounts of financial resources into the production of
items that nobody wants to buy," he said.
    He said the long-term answer is to switch some of the
financial resources now committed to agriculture to other more
productive areas. This would help agriculture because some its
inefficient non-productive segments would stop operating, he
said.
    Individual segments in many countries may lose in the
process, but it should result in a more rational system of
world-wide production within 10 or 15 years, he said.
    It is important that the agriculture negotiations reach a

linked increased borrowing by Indonesia, the Third World's
sixth largest debtor, to fresh measures to deregulate trade and
dismantle protectionist barriers.
    "We would like to see the Indonesian government continue the
adjustment process ... To move towards increased deregulation
of the economy," Conable told a press conference at the end of a
three-day visit to Jakarta.
    Conable directly linked further Bank help for Indonesia's
hard-pressed balance of payments to further measures by the
government to reduce protectionism and increase efficiency.
    The World Bank last month granted Indonesia a 300 mln dlr
trade adjustment loan. He said further loans would depend on
the economic policies Indonesia adopted.
    But he said that in meetings with both President Suharto
and leading Indonesian ministers he had not called for specific
policy changes.
    "The initiative will have to rest with the Indonesian
government. We are not here to dictate to them," he stated.
    Indonesia, the only Asian member of Opec, has been badly
hit by last year's slump in oil prices which cut its revenues
from crude exports in half.
    Conable had what he termed a frank meeting this morning
with Suharto.
    He voiced support for measures already taken, including
September's 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah, and efforts to
deregulate imports and stimulate exports.
    "The government can rely on the support of the World Bank in
a continuing program of adjustment to the economic realities of
today's world," he said.
    The Bank has loaned Indonesia 10.7 billion dlrs over the
past 20 years. Lending is now about one billion a year.
    The World Bank would probably like to see further
dismantling of tarrif barriers and measures to reduce
Indonesia's protected monopolies in areas like steel, plastics
and cement, western bankers and diplomats said.
    The government has already said it will announce further
deregulation measures, but has given no timetable. It is also
considering selling off loss-making state companies.
    Conable said the Bank would try to help Indonesia find
funds to cover its share of development projects, which
otherwise would have to be scrapped or postponed. Japan's Ex-Im
bank announced a 900 mln dlr untied credit last month.

Committee voted to ease restrictions on exports that are now

    The Democratic-controlled committee said the
administration's export control policies, which restrict
shipment of thousands of products, contributed to last year's
record 169 billion dlr U.S. trade deficit.
    The committee said the legislation will cut government red
tape and make it easier for U.S. companies to compete with
foreign producers since many of the goods are readily available
from other countries.
    Rep. Don Bonker, chairman of the International Economic

the U.S. 17 billion dlrs in exports a year.
    "This is Congress' number one opportunity to attack the
trade deficit in a positive way by exporting more," the

    The legislation would order the Commerce Department to lift
controls on 40 pct of goods on the restricted export list over
the next three years unless other countries agree to comparable
controls.
    Most of these are of the least sophisticated type of

    He said in a statement a crash program was needed in the

becoming "one of the world's industrial lightweights."
    Bywater's remarks came as the White House Economic Policy
Council prepared for a Thursday meeting to decide what
sanctions if any should be taken against Japan for alleged 
violations of a U.S.-Japanese semiconductors agreement.
    The pact, agreed to last July, called for Tokyo to end
selling semiconductors at below cost and to open its home
market to U.S. goods. In return, Washington agreed to forego
antidumping duties on Japanese semiconductors.
    But U.S. officials have said that while Japan has stopped
dumping in the U.S. market, it has not ended third country
dumping; nor has it opened its market to U.S. semiconductors.
    Japan yesterday, in an effort to ward off U.S. action,
ordered a cutback in semiconductors production as a way to
force prices up and end the dumping.
    Bywater, in his statement, said he backed a Defense Science
Board task force proposal to set up a consortium to develop new
electronic products and manufacturing processes and make the
U.S. industory more competitive.
    But he added the industry could not wait for legislation to
pass and that action was required now to help the depressed
electronic industry.

retaliatory steps that are permitted under U.S. law and GATT

today vowed to do everything possible to fight the U.S. action
against Canadian potash exports, but also warned against
raising the alarm too early in the dispute.
    In the latest flashpoint in Canadian-U.S. trade relations,
the U.S. International Trade Commission ruled unanimously
Monday that Canadian potash shipments valued at 270 million
U.S. dlrs last year were injuring the U.S. industry.
    "We certainly intend to do everything we can to insure that
Canadian interests are well protected," Clark told the House of
Commons in the daily question period.
    But he said the opposition parties should be careful "not
to raise false alarms too early."
    The case now goes before the U.S. Commerce Department's
trade division to determine if a duty should be imposed. Potash
producers from New Mexico, claiming unfair government
subsidies, are seeking a 43 pct tariff on Canada's shipments.
    Canada, the world's largest potash producer, exported 9.8
mln metric tonnes of potash last year, with nearly a third
going to the U.S.
    Most of the potash, used in the production of fertilizer,
comes from provincially owned mines in Saskatchewan.
    In the Commons, Liberal member Lloyd Axworthy branded the
ruling as just another "trade harrassment" from the U.S. and
criticized Clark's assurances the country's interests would be
protected.
    "We received exactly the same kind of assurances in the
softwood lumber case that was totally fumbled and bumbled,"
Axworthy said.
    Canada's Progressive Conservative government agreed to
impose a 15 pct duty on its softwood lumber exports earlier
this year to end a long and bitter bilateral trade dispute with
the U.S.
    Axworthy urged the government to present Canada's case to
world trade authorities under the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade.
    But Clark maintained the potash dispute was another example
of why Canada needs to find a new way to settle bilateral
irritants in the free trade negotiations under way with the
U.S.
    "What we are seeking to do is put in place a better
system," Clark said.
    Meanwhile, Saskatchewan Trade Minister Bob Andrew expressed
confidence Canada would win its case, claiming the problem
stems from low international commodity prices and not
government subsidies.
    "The reality of the problem and the injury is caused
worldwide," he said. "It's caused by a downturn in the
commodity price for fertilizer, whether it's potash fertilizer,
nitrogen fertilizer or whatever."

    The Ways and Means Committess' trade bill forces President
Reagan to retaliate against unfair trade practices that violate
international trade agreements but it allows him to wave
retaliatory tariffs or quotas if the action would hurt the U.S.
economy.
    The trade bill gives U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
Yeutter more authority in trade negotiations and in decisions
to grant domestic industries import relief.
    It also gives him authority to decide whether foreign trade
practices are unfair and violate U.S. trading rights. These
powers are currently held by President Reagan.
    The administration has strongly objected to this transfer
of authority from Reagan to Yeutter.
    The bill also extends U.S. authority to negotiate

other trade legislation and voted on in the House in April.

dominate the world electronics market.
    Baldrige told the Senate Finance Committee the United

    Asked after his testimony if this meant the United States
would close its markets to Japan if they did not open theirs,
Baldrige said, "I'm not prepared to say that, but it certainly
would be one of the alternatives studied."

committee with jurisdiction over trade said he was concerned
about a resolution on bilateral trade negotiations adopted by
the Canadian House of Commons last week.
    The resolution supports negotiation of a bilateral trading
agreement with the United States while protecting Canadian
political sovereignty, social programs, agricultural marketing
systems, the auto industry and Canada's cultural identity.
    Senate Finance Committee chairman Lloyd Bentsen said the
resolution may jeopardize the viability of the proposed free
trade agreement between the two countries, which are each
other's largest trading partners.
    "We need a truly free trade agreement, which means both
countries have to work toward a deal that is mutually
beneficial and comprehensive, a large agreement," the Texas
Democrat said in a statement.
    "I do not question Canada's right to protect its political
sovereignty or cultural identity. However, if these phrases
mean the government of Canada means to take important economic
issues off the table in these negotiations, I am deeply
concerned," he added.
    Bentsen said Canada restricts trade 15 different ways while
the United States uses only six trade restriction methods. He
said if Canada proposes an agreement where both countries get
rid of six methods of trade restriction, it would not be fair
and might not win Senate approval.
    "I am deeply concerned that when the President visits Prime
Minister (Brian) Mulroney next month, he will be presented with
this kind of argument, and I hope he makes it clear -- as I did
when I was in Canada -- that only a mutually beneficial
agreement will be successful," Bentsen said.
    Reagan and Mulroney are scheduled to meet April 5-6 in
Ottawa.
    Bentsen urged Mulroney to withdraw a proposal that would
ban imports of independently produced films into Canada by
non-Canadians, which the senator called a protectionist
measure.

talks on agricultural trade reform to be inseperable from talks
on other trade reform in the present GATT round, Willy de
Clercq, external relations commissioner of the EC, said.
    He told reporters here the EC would not bow to pressure to
reach an early, seperate agreement on agricultural trade.
    He said the EC wanted to stick to the four-year schedule
agreed by members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT) in Punta del Este, Uruguay, last year. That included
agricultural trade liberalisation for the first time in the
lengthy program to re-negotiate the GATT.
    Other trade issues being discussed in the current GATT
round include reform of trade in merchandise and services.
    De Clercq is on his way to China after attending a two-day
conference for 22 GATT trade ministers held in New Zealand.
    Several of those ministers criticised the EC for what they
saw as restrictive agricultural trade practices and called for
urgent reforms. U.S. Trade representative, Clayton Yeutter,
also said it was important agreement on agricultural trade
reform was reached as early as possible.
    But de Clercq said the GATT program had been reached after
long and hard negotiations, and the EC did not want changes.
    "We just want to stick to the agreement which was reached,
and that was very clear -- that the new round would be one

prospects even though foreign markets have become more
difficult because of the mark's strength the Economics Ministry
said.
     The ministry's parliamentary state secretary Ludolf Georg
von Wartenberg, told a business conference German exports could
start rising again in real terms during 1987, reversing the
lower export trend which emerged in mid-1986.
    But even if the turnaround did not occur, there would be no
need to worry about the economy as long as the weakness of
exports did not affect currently good domestic demand.
    Von Wartenberg said consumer demand remained quite good but
noted there had been a cooling in the investment climate. "This
is certainly a reason for heightened watchfulness but not for
stimulative steps," he said.
    The best way for Bonn to help its exporters is to work
actively to promote free world trade, he added.
    Von Wartenberg said the economy still had good export
opportunities. Price alone was not the only factor in
international competitiveness, he said, adding German firms
have a reputation for high quality standards, prompt delivery
times and good service.
    Von Wartenberg said the government was in a difficult
position on its trade figures.  It faced international pressure
to reduce its trade surplus, but West Germans were worried
about the effect of the mark's strength on the country's
exporters.
    Reports about the trade surplus, especially overseas,
tended to concentrate on nominal trade figures, which rose to a
record 112.2 billion marks in 1986, he said. But this rise was
due entirely to the lower value of imports caused by the
decline of both the dollar and oil prices. German exports have
in fact been falling in real terms for sometime, he said.

and I'm quite confident that President Reagan doesn't think
it's a very good idea," Baker said in an interview on Cable
News Network's "Moneyline" television program.
    He said U.S. taxpayers are taxed at a rate of 19 pct of GNP
which is traditionally where it has been, but the Federal
Government is spending at a rate of 24 pct of GNP. Baker said
spending cuts are clearly the best way to cut budget deficits.
    Baker said he opposed a stock transactions tax proposed by
House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Tex, or other special taxes.
    "The stock transfer tax would be a particularly unfortunate
approach to take," the Treasury Secretary said. He said the
United States has some of the most efficient capital markets in

lending to developing countries. He was questioned about this
after the Standard and Poor's Corp downgrading today of the

because of their heavy developing nation loan exposure.

foreign trade deficit is misplaced and the country's real
problem lies in its large federal budget deficit, the General
Agreeement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) said.
     By stressing its record trade deficit of 169.8 billion
dlrs last year, the U.S. Was fuelling protectionist pressure
which threatens the world trading system, it said in an annual
report.
    The fundamental problem, the size of the U.S. Federal
budget deficit, could be remedied only by cutting government
spending or encouraging personal savings to finance the debt,
it said.
    GATT also predicted world trade would grow by only 2.5 pct
in 1987 -- a full percentage point lower than in each of the
previous two years.
    GATT experts urged Washington to resist protectionism and
instead seek macroeconomic changes to reduce the current
account payments deficit -- higher private savings, lower
investment and a smaller federal budget deficit.
    Raising U.S. Trade barriers "would result in little or no
reduction in the current account deficit. It would, however,
increase inflation and reduce world trade," it said.
    "The basic cause -- some combination of insufficient
domestic savings and an excessive budget deficit -- would
remain," the report said.
    GATT economists said trade expansion would slow this year
because of slower growth forecasts in Japan and some West
European nations as they adjust production and workforces to a
low dollar, risk of higher U.S. Inflation, concerns over Third
World debt management and looming protectionism.
    The report also said imbalances in the current accounts of
Japan, West Germany and the U.S. Had increased in 1986.
    The most likely explanation was that exchange rate changes
were not backed by changes in macroeconomic policies, it added.
    "Thus the prediction that these imbalances would be reduced
as a result of the major realignment of exchange rates was not
borne out last year," the report said.
    GATT warned there was a risk of a sizeable increase in the
U.S. Inflation rate under the combined impact of a rapidly
expanding money supply and low dollar.
    "Such a development could worsen the business climate by
increasing uncertainty and pushing up interest rates, which, in
turn, would adversely affect world trade."
    But the report noted a surprising rise in imports to the
United States, despite the dollar's depreciation which makes
foreign products more expensive.
    It suggested that resources idle in the U.S., Both human
and in underutilised factories, were not geared to produce the
goods and services sought from abroad.
    World trade in manufactures grew by only three pct in 1986,
about half of the rate of the previous year.
    Trade in agricultural goods expanded by just one pct,
continuing a stagnant pattern in that sector this decade, GATT
said.
    Developing countries' exports declined significantly, while
their imports increased moderately, although full statistics
are not available yet, GATT said.
    The combined export earnings of 16 major indebted nations
were sharply lower, and only five of them (Chile, Colombia,
Philippines, South Korea, and Thailand) had higher exports.

    There was no immediate announcement on the council's

    U.S. Officials said President Reagan would probably act on

semiconductors in world markets and to open its own market to
U.S.-made semiconductors.

Japanese market remains closed.
    The pressure on Reagan to retaliate included a unanimous
call by the Senate last week to impose penalties on Japanese
high technology products containing semiconductors.
    A call for retaliation also came from the semiconductor

visit Washington next month in a bid to defuse mounting U.S.
Anger over Japanese trade policies, but Western diplomats said
they believed his chances of success were slim.
    Boxed in by powerful political pressure groups and
widespread opposition to his tax reform plans, Nakasone will be
hard-pressed to come up with anything new to tell U.S.
President Ronald Reagan and key U.S. Congressmen, they said.
    News of the week-long visit starting April 29 coincided
with news that Japan recorded a 8.14 billion dlr trade surplus
last month, more than 70 pct higher than a year earlier.
    It also came one day after the Reagan Administration's
Economic Policy Council decided to take retaliatory action
against Japan for its alleged failure to live up to a joint
trade agreement on computer microchips.
    Nakasone wants to go armed with two separate packages - one
designed to pep up Japan's sagging economy and imports in the
short-term, the other to redirect the country in the medium
term away from its over-dependence on exports for growth.
    But government officials said political infighting could
rob both packages of much of their punch and might even prevent
one from seeing the light of day.
    Nakasone has insisted that the government would not draw up
a package of short-term economic measures until after its
1987/88 budget passed parliament because he feared that would
amount to a tacit admission that the budget was inadequate.
    But his hopes for quick passage of the budget in time for
his trip have been shattered by a parliamentary boycott by
opposition parties protesting over the sales tax plan.
    Faced with the possibility that he might have to go to the
U.S. Virtually empty-handed, Nakasone today ordered his ruling
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to come up with its own
measures.
    He can then tell Reagan the LDP package will form the basis
of the government's plans, without losing face in parliament
over the budget, political analysts said.
    Officials working on the government's short-term economic
package said it would probably include interest rate cuts on
loans by government corporations, deregulation, measures to
pass on some of the benefits of the strong yen to consumers in
the form of lower prices, and accelerated public investment.
    They said a record portion of state investment planned for
the entire 1987/88 fiscal year will take place in the first
half, probably over 80 pct.
    Diplomats said that was unlikely to be enough to satisfy
Reagan, who is under pressure from the Democrat-controlled U.S.
Congress to take greater action to cut the huge American trade
deficit.
    To complement the short-term measures, Nakasone is also
likely to present Reagan with details of Japan's longer-term
economic plans.
    A high-ranking advisory body headed by former Bank of Japan
governor Haruo Maekawa is expected to come up with a final
report outlining concrete steps to redirect the economy days
before Nakasone is scheduled to leave for Washington.
    Its recommendations are designed as a follow-up to
Maekawa's report last year on economic restructuring and are
likely to cover such potentially politically explosive areas as
agricultural reform and land policy, officials said.
    While wanting to make the report as explicit and detailed
as possible, they said the political realities might force them
to water down some of the committee's recommendations.
    A subcommittee is considering what the Japanese economy
might look like in the medium to longer term after it undergoes
massive restructuring, officials said. The subcommittee
projects that the current account surplus will fall to less
than two pct of Japan's total output, or gross national
product, around 1993 or 1995. Last year the surplus, which
measures trade in goods and services, amounted to over four pct
of gnp.
    The subcommittee also projects annual economic growth for
Japan of nearly four pct over that period and a very gradual
appreciation of the yen, to about 130 to the dollar by around
1993, from 150 now.

countertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit and
conserve foreign exchange.
    Wheat, tobacco, tea, coffee, jute, engineering and
electronic goods, as well as minerals including iron ore, are
all on offer in return for crude oil, petroleum products,
chemicals, steel and machinery, trade sources told Reuters.
    Most of the impetus behind countertrade, which began in
1984, comes from two state trading firms -- the State Trading
Corp (STC) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp (MMTC).
    "The two state trading corporations are free to use their
buying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indian
exports," a commerce ministry spokeswoman said, adding that
private firms are excluded from countertrading.
    One trade source said India has targetted countries that
depend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreign
imports.
    However, countertrade deals still make up only a small part
of India's total trading and are likely to account for less
than eight pct of the estimated 18.53 billion dlrs in trade
during the nine months ended December, the sources said.
    Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India's 25.65
billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985/86 ended March,
against almost nothing in 1984/85, official figures show.
    However, the figures exclude exchanges with the Eastern
Bloc paid in non-convertible Indian rupees, the sources said.
    Total trade with the Soviet Union, involving swaps of
agricultural produce and textiles for Soviet arms and crude
oil, is estimated at 3.04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986/87,
against three billion in 1985/86.
    Indian countertrade, which is being promoted mainly to help
narrow the country's large trade deficit, is still
insignificant compared with agreements reached by Indonesia,
Venezuela and Brazil, the trade sources said.
    The trade deficit, which hit an estimated record 6.96
billion dlrs in 1985/86, is expected to decline to 5.6 billion
in the current fiscal year.
    But the push to include non-communist countries in
countertrade is also due to other factors, including the slow
growth of foreign reserves, a tight debt repayment schedule,
shrinking aid and trade protectionism, businessmen said.
    One source said India is showing more dynamism in promoting
countertrade deals than in the past, when the deals were made
discreetly because they break GATT rules. As a member of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), India cannot
officially support bartering.
    The MMTC's recent countertrade deals include iron ore
exports to Yugoslavia for steel structures and rails.
    "MMTC's recent global tenders now include a clause that
preference will be given to parties who accept payment in kind
for goods and services sold to India," a trade official said,
adding that the policy remains flexible.
    "We also take into account other factors such as prices at
which the goods and services are offered to India," the trade
official said.
    Early this year the commerce ministry quietly told foreign

licences of selected Japanese banks and securities companies
operating in London's financial City when they come up for
renewal next summer if progress is not made towards opening up
Japan's markets to foreign competition, government sources
said.
    "We can't say "yes, we are going to do it (revoke licences)"
but this is definitely being considered," an official said.
    His comments came after the government was formally urged
today by a cross-section of influential MPs to take joint
retaliatory action with the United States against Japan.
    Britain has grown increasingly impatient with Japanese
trade practices. "There's a sense of urgency here now, but the
emphasis is on securing - not undermining - our interests in
Japan," another government official told Reuters.
    Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said on Thursday that
Britain would not hesitate to use new powers contained in the
Financial Services Act 1986 and the Banking Bill to retaliate
against countries that do not offer reciprocal market access.
    She clearly had Japan in mind, government sources said.
    The U.K. Last year showed a trade defict with Japan of 3.7
billion stg, official figures show.
    A parliamentary motion, signed by 98 MPs, today urged the
U.K. Government to "coordinate action with the President of the
United States, and through the Department of Trade and
Industry, to suspend all further applications from Japanese
communications companies for equipment approval by the British
Approvals Board for Telecommunications, and all further
applications from Japanese financial institutions for licences"
until authorities in Japan stopped imposing what the MPs called
"restrictive conditions" on the bid by (Cable and Wireless PLC)
(cawl.L) and its U.S. And Japanese partners for a stake in
Japan's international telecommunications market.
    The motion for retaliatory steps came from a cross-section
of MPs, reflecting the strength of feeling inside Parliament.
Parliamentarians said their action would increase pressure on
the Conservative government to take firm action.
    Officials said another option now being considered by the
U.K. Is to refuse issuing new banking licences to Japanese
institutions. That could be done under the government's
proposed Banking Bill now moving through parliament.
    58 Japanese financial institutions are authorised to deal
in London, of which 29 are banks. In Tokyo, 14 London-based
firms are authorised to do financial business, officials said.
    The new financial services and banking acts offer Britain
an alternative for retaliation which would be otherwise denied
under legally-binding international trade agreements.
    "The Financial Services Act gives (Trade and Industry
Secretary Paul) Channon power to stop firms from engaging in
investment, banking and insurance," one official said.
    "This point has been made to the Japanese at official level
a number times," the official added.
    Britain and France are now working together to urge that
the European Community take collective action against Japan,
but by working within EC treaties, another official said.
    British Trade Minister Alan Clark said this week in a radio
interview that the European Community should build barriers
against Japanese imports through certification procedures
similar to those facing European exporters in Japan.
    "There comes a point where you cannot resist any longer," he
said, adding "(such barriers) can't be put in place overnight."
Clark said the issue of reciprocity regarding visible trade
"strikes at the basis of whether British industry is to have a
fair access to an extremely large market (Japan) which is
itself in a very dominant position (in) certain aspects of our
own domestic market ... It is really a question of fairness."
    The situation is only likely to worsen following news that
Japan's trade surplus with the rest of the world rose by more
than 70 pct in February, year-on-year, to 8.14 billion dlrs
from 5.7 billion in January, political sources said.
    But Clark said in his interview that the issues of visible
trade and access to financial markets should be kept separate.
    Should Britain decide to act against Japanese financial
institutions, it would most likely focus on the smaller, rather
than larger ones, to minimise any risks to its role as a global
business centre, government sources said. Japan's four largest
securities houses are members of the London Stock Exchange.
    In Washington, White House officials said President Reagan
was ready to impose retaliatory trade action against Japan for
breaking its semiconductor agreement with the United States.
    There was no immediate indication when Reagan might act on
the recommendations of his Economic Policy Council to curb
Japanese exports to the United States but officials said the
move could come today or early next week.
    Trade sources said the actions being weighed by Reagan
included tariffs on a wide variety of Japanese exports which

angrily to news the United States plans to take retaliatory
action against them for allegedly failing to live up to an
agreement on trade in computer microchips.
    Electronic Industries Association of Japan (EIAJ) Chairman
Shoichi Saba stated: "EIAJ believes that it is premature and
even irrational to attempt an assessment of the impact of the
agreement and our efforts to comply with it only six months
after concluding the agreement."
    "We urge U.S. Governmental authorities to reconsider the
decision made, to evaluate fairly the results of Japanese
efforts in implementing the objectives of the agreement, and to
resist emotional biases," he said.
    Yesterday, Washington announced plans to slap as much as
300 mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese imports in retaliation for
what is sees as Japan's failure to comply with the terms of the
pact.
    The agreement, struck late last year after months of heated
negotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips
on world markets and to buy more American-made semiconductors.
    To salvage the pact, Tokyo has instructed its chip makers
to slash production and has helped establish a multi-lateral
organisation designed to promote chip imports.
    Saba said that Japanese chip companies have pledged three
mln dlrs over the next five years to the new organisation and
expressed regret that no American company has seen fit to join.
    "This suggests that American semiconductor manufacturers may
not be really interested in participating in the Japanese
market," he said.

a conciliatory note in Japan's increasingly bitter row with the
United States over trade in computer microchips.
    "Japan wants to resolve the issue through consultations by
explaining its stance thoroughly and correcting the points that
need to be corrected," he was quoted by Kyodo News Service as
saying.
    While expressing regret over America's decision to impose
tariffs on imports of Japanese electrical goods, Nakasone said
Tokyo was willing to send a high-level official to Washington
to help settle the dispute.
    Government officials said Japan would make a formal request
next week for emergency talks and that the two sides would
probably meet the week after, just days before the April 17
deadline set by Washington for the tariffs to take effect.
    Tokyo is expected to propose a joint U.S./Japan
investigation of American claims that Japanese companies are
dumping cut-price chips in Asian markets.
    Yesterday, Washington announced plans to put as much as 300
mln dlrs in tariffs on imports of certain Japanese electronic
goods in retaliation for what it sees as Tokyo's failure to
live up to their bilateral chip pact.
    That agreement, hammered out late last year after months of
heated negotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-price
chips in world markets and to buy more American-made chips.
    Nakasone's comments seemed distinctly more conciliatory
than those of his Trade and Industry Minister, Hajime Tamura,
who earlier today said Japan was ready to take "appropriate
measures" if Washington went ahead with the sanctions.
    Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)
officials later sought to downplay the significance of Tamura's
remark and said that his main message was that the two sides
need to talk urgently about the issue.
    But they admitted that Japan was considering taking the
United States to GATT, the Geneva-based international
organization which polices world trade, if Washington imposed
the tariffs.
    Any Japanese action would probably be taken under Article
23 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), they
said. If that article were invoked, GATT would set up a panel
to consider the legality of the U.S. Action.
    But officials here said they hope that can be avoided. "It
may be wishful thinking but there is a possibility the United
States may lift its decision at an early date," Tamura said.
    In announcing the U.S. Sanctions yesterday, President
Ronald Reagan said he was prepared to lift them once he had
evidence that Japan was no longer dumping chips in world
markets and had opened up its own market to imports.
    Japanese government officials said they are confident they
can make the pact work.
    They said that the export of cut-price Japanese chips
through unregulated distributors has all but dried up after
MITI instructed domestic makers to cut output.
    While acknowledging that it is harder to increase Japanese
imports of American chips, MITI officials said that the
ministry is doing all it can to ensure that happens.
    The Ministry recently called on Japan's major chip users,
some of whom are also leading producers, to step up their
purchases of foreign semiconductors.
    A spokesman for one of the companies, Toshiba Corp <TSBA.T>
said his firm would do just that and could announce its plans
in the next week or so. He expects other Japanese companies to
do likewise.

trade war, government officials said.
    "We hope that the dispute on this specific issue won't have
an adverse effect on our overall relationship with the United
States," a Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)
official said.
     On Friday, Washington announced plans for as much as 300

alleged failure to live up to a bilateral computer chip pact.
    That agreement, reached last year after heated
negotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips
in world markets and to buy more American-made semiconductors.
    Foreign Ministry officials immediately tried to isolate the
fall-out from the dispute by seeking to separate it from Prime
Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's planned trip to Washington at the
end of April.
    While Japan has already done about all it can to make sure
the chip pact is working, the government is studying measures
it can take in other fields to defuse American anger and ensure
the trip's success, they said.
    "The perception of Japan in the (U.S.) Congress is very bad,"
one official told Reuters. "We would very much like to do
something to respond to that."
    In an apparent effort to prevent the chip dispute from
spreading to other areas, MITI officials sought to depict the
U.S. Action as a severe warning to Japanese semiconductor
makers, not to the government.
    Faced with a belligerent domestic chip industry and an
angry American Congress, the Japanese government has been
forced to walk an increasingly fine line in the semiconductor
dispute, trade analysts said.
    They said that it was an open secret that Japan's largest
chip maker, NEC Corp, was not happy with what it viewed as the
draconian measures MITI was taking to implement the pact,
included enforced production cuts.
    The angry response of Japanese chip makers yesterday to the
announcement of the U.S. Tariffs highlighted the difficulties
the government faces in taking further action.
    "Japanese semiconductor manufacturers have complied with the
U.S./Japan agreement," said Shoichi Saba, Chairman of the

 ]]></BODY><BODY><![CDATA[The Japanese government appears to have
little new to offer to settle a dispute with the U.S. Over
computer chips, trade analysts and government officials said.
    The U.S. Has threatened to impose tariffs worth up to 300
mln dlrs on Japanese electronics exports to the U.S., In
retaliation for Japan's alleged failure to keep a pact on the
microchip trade signed last September.
    A Foreign Ministry official told Reuters "Japan has done
what it can, and now we must persuade the United States to wait
for those steps to take effect."
    The U.S. Alleges that, in defiance of the September
agreement, Japan is still selling microchips at below cost in
non-U.S. Markets and refusing to open Japan further to U.S.
Chip sales. U.S. Tariffs are due to take effect on April 17.
     Analysts noted Japan's Ministry of International Trade and
Industry (MITI) has already ordered chipmakers to cut
production in order to dry up the source of cheap chips sold in
third countries at non-regulated prices.
    "I'm not sure MITI can do much more than it has," said
Jardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd analyst Nick Edwards.
    A MITI official said the Ministry was not planning to call
for production cuts beyond those already sought, although it
would continue to press chip users to buy more foreign goods.
    Spokesmen for some Japanese electronics firms said they
would consider buying more U.S. Chips. But a Matsushita
Electric Industrial Co spokesman said a rapid increase in
imports was not likely.
    Most analysts said Japanese exporters would be hard hit if
the United States did implement the tariffs, which would be
levied on consumer electronics products rather than on
microchips themselves.
    "If the tariffs remain in place for any length of time,
there will be complete erosion of exports to the United States,"
said Tom Murtha, analyst at James Capel and Co.
    "The Japanese electronics industry is too powerful to be
stopped altogether, but recovery for the industry will be
delayed for another year," he said.
    Some analysts said tariffs would also harm U.S. Industry by
stepping up offshore production and by reducing demand in Japan
for semiconductors U.S. Firms are trying to sell here.
    "The American approach is full of contradictions," Jardine
Fleming's Edwards said.
    "If they want to expand (U.S.) exports, the last thing they
want to do is hit the makers of the final products because that
hurts the final market," Edwards said.
    But other analysts said the dispute reflects not just U.S.
Concern over what it sees as a strategic industry, but also
frustration with Japan's vast trade surplus. Some analysts
argued that to solve the semiconductor problem Japan may have
to take action beyond that pledged in the semiconductor pact.
    Carole Ryavec, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd,
said "The major overall issue is to stimulate the domestic
economy and move away from an export-dependent economy."

 ]]></BODY><BODY><![CDATA[The U.S. Congress is making Japan,
with its enormous worldwide trade surplus, the symbol of the
U.S. trade crisis and the focus of its efforts to turn around
America's record trade deficit.
    "Japan has come to symbolize what we fear most in trade: the
challenge to our high technology industries, the threat of
government nutured competition, and the multitude of barriers
to our exports," Senate Democratic Leader Robert Byrd said.
    "If we can find a way to come to terms with Japan over trade
problems, we can manage our difficulties with other countries,"
the West Virginia Democrat said at a Senate Finance Committee
hearing on the trade bill.
    Byrd and House Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat, have
made trade legislation a priority this year and a wide-ranging
bill is being readied for probable House approval next month.
    Japan's bilateral trade surplus jumped from 12 billion dlrs
in 1980 to 62 billion dlrs last year. Its surplus rose to 8.14
billion dlrs in February from 5.7 billion dlrs in January.
    Congress points to the record 169 billion dlrs U.S. trade
deficit in 1986 and the slow response in the trade imbalance to
the dollar's decline in world currency markets as a reason to
press Japan to buy more U.S. goods.
    They are particularly dismayed by the rapid deterioration
in U.S. exports of sophisticated computer technology.
    In response to the growing anger and pressure by the U.S.
semiconductor industry, President Reagan Friday announced he
intended to raise tariffs as much as 300 mln dlrs on Japanese
electronic goods in retaliation for Japan's failure to abide by
a 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor agreement.
    Congress also has been been angered by the administration's
lack of success with Japan on a host of other trade issues
including beef, citrus, automobile parts, telecommunications
goods, and financial services.
    The bulk of the House trade bill was written last week in
four committees. It is a package of trade sanctions and
measures to force the administration take tough action against
foreign trade barriers and unfair competition.
    Although most provisions do not single out Japan, in many
cases their impact would be to restrict imports of Japanese
products or make them more expensive with higher duties.
    The cornerstone of the trade legislation passed the House
Ways and Means Committee by a vote of 34 to 2. Its focus is to
force President Reagan to retaliate against unfair foreign
competition and to make it easier for U.S. industries to win
temporary relief from surges in imports.
    The most controversial issue, an amendment to restrict
imports if countries such as Japan with large surpluses do not
buy more U.S. goods was left for an April vote by the House.
    Rep. Richard Gephardt, a Democratic presidential aspirant
from Missouri, has the support of Wright and other key
Democrats to press for passage of the amendment.
    The measure would have the most impact on Japan, West
Germany, Taiwan and South Korea. If Japan, for example, does
not reduce its barriers by mid-1988, the United States would
set import quotas or tariffs to cut Japanese surplus by ten per
cent a year for three years.
    "I'm tired of going into companies and having managers say
to me, 'We're not over competing in Japan because we can't
compete in the marketplace.' That argument needs to be taken
away from American business," Gephardt said.
    The administration has said it could not support a trade
bill containing such a provision.
    
 ]]></BODY><BODY><![CDATA[A high level U.S. trade official
said it would be foolish for Japan to strike back against the
United States for its sanctions on Japanese semiconductor
electronics products.
    Asked by reporters if Japan was expected to retaliate
against U.S. exports, Deputy Under Secretary of Commerce Bruce
Smart replied, "That would be the height of foolishness."
    In addition, he doubted Japan could show enough progress in
meeting the conditions of the agreement to avoid the actual
imposition of the 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on April 17.
    Japan's 58.6 billion dlr trade surplus with the United
States last year has come under fire in Congress concerned
about the loss of jobs to foreign competition and with the
record 169 billion dlrs U.S. trade deficit in 1986.
    President Reagan's sanctions decision won praise today from
the two Democratic leaders of Congress.
    "I think it's about time," Senate Democratic Leader Robert
Byrd of West Virginia told reporters. House Speaker Jim Wright
of Texas told reporters before the opening of the House
session, "It just shows we were right all along when we said
something needs doing."
    Smart testified before a Senate Labor Committee hearing
that last Friday's U.S. trade action would help U.S.
negotiations on access to Japan for U.S. auto parts.
    Since last August Smart has been leading talks to open up
Japan to purchases of more U.S.-made automotive parts. Last
year, Japan racked up a 3.6 billion dlr trade surplus with the
United States in these products.
    Both countries expect to conclude the talks by August 1987.
    "It's amazing to me that the Japanese were surprised. I
hope it will persuade them we're serious," Smart said of the
White House trade sanctions.
    The United States has tried to convince Japanese car
companies of the quality of American-made parts and to draw
them away from their traditional Japanese suppliers.
    "All we ask is a chance. We have a job to do persuading them
we can do better than our reputation seems to be," he said.
    Measured per car, each American-made car contained about
700 dlrs in Japanese auto parts while each Japanese-made car
contained about 26 dlrs in U.S. auto parts, Smart said.

been dealt a fatal political blow by the yen's renewed rapid
rise and the threat of a trade war with the United States,
political analysts said.
    Nakasone, already under fire over an unpopular tax reform
plan, may now be forced to resign before the June economic
summit of seven industrialised nations if local elections later
next month go against candidates from his ruling Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP), they said.
    "The close relationship between Nakasone and President
Reagan was an important element of Nakasone's power base,"
Waseda University Political Science Professor Mitsuru Uchida
told Reuters. "So the emergence of U.S. Criticism damages
Nakasone."
    Even before the latest trade friction flared, Nakasone was
encountering criticism not only from opposition parties but
also within his own LDP over his proposal to levy a sales tax.
    "Many factions within the LDP are distancing themselves from
Nakasone," Uchida said. "His position within the LDP itself is
not so strongly established today."
    Nakasone, who has been more popular with the general public
than with many LDP members, is now seeing his public support
eroded, the analysts said.
    The yen's rise to record highs and the U.S. Threat on
Friday to impose tariffs on Japanese electronics goods in
retaliation for Japan's alleged violation of a microchip trade
pact are now giving Nakasone's critics fresh ammunition, the
analysts said.
    "Apparently the special relationship between Reagan and
Nakasone hasn't worked effectively," Rei Shiratori, director of
the Institute for Political Studies in Japan, said.
    This is making the Japanese people doubt Nakasone's
credibility, Shiratori told Reuters.
    The cumulative impact of the sales tax issue, the yen's
rise and mounting trade friction could mean serious LDP losses
in the April 11 and 26 local elections, analysts said.
    "If the elections go against the LDP, Nakasone may have to
resign early," Shiratori said.
    But Nakasone still has a chance to soothe U.S. Tempers
before or during his week-long Washington visit from April 29,
some analysts said.
    However, "unless the Japanese political system can move more
quickly to give Nakasone some nice present to take to
Washington on smouldering trade issues, he will face a very
hostile audience," said Merrill Lynch Securities economist
William Sterling.
    "If the trip is a major disaster, it would seem to put the
final nail in his coffin," he said.
    Reagan's own weakened domestic position, and growing
Republican as well as Democratic anger with Japan, argue
against a quick settlement to the trade dispute, the analysts
said.
    But a desire on both sides to find some solution, coupled
with uncertainty at home and abroad over likely successors to
Nakasone, could still lead to an attempt to paper over the
differences and aid Nakasone, they said.
    "One factor against a trade war may be that Washington is
not anxious to push Nakasone into his grave," Sterling said.

electronic goods may upset West European officials, but they
generally seem prepared to stay on the sidelines in the latest
trade row between the United States and Japan.
    Japan's huge trade surplus is a sore point in West Europe,
as it is in the United States. But U.S. Charges of unfair trade
practices involving computer microchips leave Europeans cold.
    The European Community ran a 18.2 billion dlr trade deficit
with Japan last year, and seeks redress when it feels Japanese
trade policy hurts Europeans, diplomats and economists said.
    But only in Britain has there been any suggestion of acting
with the U.S. To do something about Japan's huge trade surplus.
    "The EC is no more illiberal on trade issues than is the
U.S.," said Martin Wolf, director of studies at the Trade Policy
Research Centre in London. "Basically, their policies are pretty
much the same."
    But that did not mean Europe would support the U.S., Or
that the EC would climb on the bandwagon to take advantage of
the U.S. Dispute to press its own claims, Wolf said.Basically,
Europeans have a different approach to trade problems, he said.
    "In the U.S., People talk about fair trade, but not here," he
added. "In the U.S., It all has to do with the general ethic of
free competition, while in Europe, the general approach is that
liberal trade is good because it makes countries rich."
    Wolf said this basic U.S. Attitude explains Washington's
tendency to impose so-called "countervailing duties" - an import
tax designed to offset advantages alleged to be unfair.
    In Western Europe, the approach to trade disputes tends to
be to try to reach a settlement through negotiation, Wolf said.
    In the latest U.S.-Japan trade row, President Reagan has
threatened to raise tariffs on selected Japanese electronic
goods by as much as 300 mln dlrs, alleging that Japan has
failed to abide by a 1986 U.S.-Japan pact on microchip trade.
    But the European Community has challenged the agreement as
a violation of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)
practices that discriminates against its microchip producers.
    "It follows that they're not likely to rally to the side of
the United States in defence of the agreement," said Wolf.
    Although British parliamentarians are pushing for a tough
line on Japanese trade issues, government officials in the rest
of Europe told Reuter correspondents they would let the EC take
the lead in any response to the U.S.-Japan trade row.
    A spokeswoman for the EC Commission in Brussels told
Reuters there has been no change in the Community's position
since a March 16 meeting of foreign ministers which sent a
strong warning to Tokyo on trade imbalances.
    In a statement issued after that meeting, EC foreign
ministers deplored Japan's continued trade imbalance and
appealed for a greater Japanese effort to open up its markets.
    EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq said after
the talks there was a growing impatience with Japan in the EC.
    Diplomats accredited to the EC in Brussels said they saw no
signs of any immediate intention to impose any broad-ranging
sanctions against Japan. The EC is anxious to avoid provoking a
trade war, they said.
    Instead, the Community is trying to target problem areas in
European trade with Japan, including wines and spirits,
cosmetics, and financial services, and will continue talking to
try to improve the situation, the diplomats said.
    In Britain, where the government is angered over the
difficulties telecommunications giant Cable and Wireless has
faced in its bid to crack the Japanese market, officials said
last week that retaliatory action is being considered.
    But government officials said last night, "We are not
talking about days or weeks. This is going to take time."
    They said the government would consider its options at a
cabinet meeting on Thursday, but added that no final decisions
were expected. The main thing the British would threaten the
Japan with is denial of access to London's booming financial
markets, government officials said.

    Earlier, she told a meeting of Soviet and British

will boost imports and cut production of key memory microchips
from next month in line with government attempts to ward off
U.S. Trade sanctions, company spokesmen said.
    The moves might persuade the U.S. To call off the
sanctions, despite obstacles to full implementation of the
plans, analysts said.
    The tariffs will affect about 300 mln dlrs worth of
products and are in retaliation for Japan's alleged failure to
honour a semiconductor trade pact.
    In announcing the sanctions last Friday, President Reagan
said Japan had not fulfilled its promise to halt predatory
pricing and open Japan's market to foreign products.
    But U.S. Trade representative Clayton Yeutter said
yesterday on U.S. Television that the U.S. Is willing to drop
the tariffs if Japan shows a "clear indication" that it will open
its markets to U.S. Goods.
    The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) has
urged producers to slash output of the chips by 11 pct in the
second quarter, following a call to reduce production by more
than 20 pct the previous quarter.
    MITI also urged makers to boost chip imports.
    Analysts said the moves could encourage Washington to
cancel the tariffs ahead of next month's meeting between Prime
Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and President Reagan.
    "The U.S. Wants to be satisfied. It has rattled its sword
and shown that it can and will do business," said analyst Nick
Edwards at Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd in Tokyo.
    But analysts cautioned that although Japanese producers can
cut output, boosting imports -- the key to U.S. Withdrawal of
the sanctions -- is more difficult.
    "The U.S. Does not have the low-end consumer IC's
(integrated circuits) that the Japanese need for consumer
products. They're well supplied here," said Richard May, senior
analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd in Tokyo.
    The U.S. Leads in production of medium and high-end IC's,
but Japanese makers are keen to develop their own high-end
production skills, the analysts said.
    "The Japanese must be prepared to trade some losses on
semiconductors in return for free access to other areas," said
Edwards.
    A spokesman for Hitachi Ltd <HIT.T>, said the firm's
reduced output of 256 kilobit dynamic random access memory
(256K DRAM) was unrelated to MITI's efforts to ward off the
trade sanctions. Decreased production was a natural result of
the company increasing output of one-mln bit DRAM's, he said.
    Company officials unveiled the following plans -
    - NEC Corp <NESI.T>, Japan's largest chipmaker, plans to
slash production of 256K DRAM semiconductors by 29.41 pct to
six mln per month from a monthly average of 8.5 mln last
quarter.
     In the year beginning April 1, NEC will boost chip
imports, which comprised some 20 pct of all NEC chip
consumption the year before.
    - Hitachi Ltd's <HIT.T> April output of 256K DRAM's will
fall by 25.93 pct to four mln compared to 5.4 mln in March. The
company is trying to boost imports but has not set a specific
target. Imports are currently very low.
    - Toshiba Corp <TSBA.T> will reduce April 256K DRAM
production by 16.67 pct to just over four mln and is
considering ways to boost imports, a company official said.
    Toshiba has an agreement with Motorola Inc (MOT.N) to sell
the U.S. Firm's chips in Japan. The firms are planning a
joint-venture production of memory chips in Sendai, northern
Japan.
    - Mitsubishi Electric Corp (MIET.T) will trim second
quarter output by about 10 pct to between 5.5 mln to 5.6 mln
chips compared to the first quarter. Plans call for increased
imports but an official said "boosting imports will be difficult
as it depends on sales demand."
    - Fujitsu Ltd (ITSU.T) will cut production in accord with
MITI guidelines and boost imports from currently low levels.
    - Oki Electric Industry Co Ltd (OKIE.T) will reduce April
production by 10 pct from March's 3.2 mln. Oki is studying ways
to increase imports by 10 pct in the fiscal year beginning
April 1 from the previous year's total of more than five
billion yen, a company official said.

and Industry, Hajime Tamura, will meet representatives from 151
of the nation's largest companies next week and appeal to them
to do their best to increase imports, ministry officials said.
    The meeting was unveiled as part of a plan to boost imports
and help head off protectionist legislation in the U.S.
    Senior officials from the Ministry of International Trade
and Industry told reporters that such personal appeals appeared
to have paid off in the past, as Japanese imports of
manufactured goods have climbed.
    Leading domestic semiconductor makers will boost imports
and cut production of key memory microchips next month in an
attempt to help ward off U.S. Trade sanctions, company
spokesmen said.
    The officials also said they expect the government's new
trade insurance law to boost imports and encourage Japanese
companies to set up production facilities overseas.
    Under the new law, the government will insure Japanese
companies who pre-pay for imports against loss arising from
everything from war to bankruptcy of the foreign firm they are
dealing with. MITI estimated that it would help solve Japan's
trade problem to the tune of about $10 billion dlrs a year.

Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) is seen as a test case by
the Soviet Union, which will probably demand to follow China, a
top European Community official said.
    Willy de Clercq, External Relations Commissioner of the
European Communities, told a news conference that China's
application would involve long and difficult negotiations.
    China formally applied to join GATT in July 1986 and in
February presented a memorandum backing its application, which
De Clercq said was now being studied. Questions would then be
presented to China.
    "After China, other important state-trading countries
including the Soviet Union, will probably demand accession.
China's application could be considered a test case," he said.
    He said the EC strongly backed China's application, but
others among GATT's 92 contracting parties took a tougher line.
    Among the numerous problems of a huge centrally-run economy
entering a free trade system are tariffs and reciprocity and
the expectation that China will practice an open-trade policy
without trade discrimination, de Clercq added.
    De Clercq noted the different dimensions of the Chinese
economy and those of Hungary and Yugoslavia, the two current
Socialist GATT members.
    On China's import potential, he said a foreign exchange
shortage would force China to import less this year and next
than in the past, with an emphasis on technological equipment
and capital.
    During his visit, De Clercq has met top Chinese leaders and

    Matsunaga returned on Sunday to report to Japanese leaders

 ]]></BODY><BODY><![CDATA[French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac
opened talks with President Ronald Reagan expected to focus on
superpower arms control moves and trade issues.
    French officials said a major aim of Chirac's visit was to
present France's concern that the United States might ignore
European security interests in any accord with Moscow on
removing medium-range nuclear missiles from the continent.
    But Reagan was expected to assure Chirac that he will not
agree to a deal at the Geneva superpower talks that would give
the Russians superiority in shorter-range systems, diplomats
said.
    France has expressed doubts about removing U.S. missiles
from Europe so long as the Soviet Union maintains an edge in
other weaponry, particularly shorter-range rockets,
conventional forces and chemical weapons.
    Speaking last night, Chirac set out the French position
saying: "Any agreement on intermediate nuclear forces should
mention how equality can be achieved in short-range missiles."
    Reagan and Chirac meanwhile signed an agreement ending a
dispute between two leading research institutes over patent
rights to a blood screening test for the deadly disease AIDS.
    In a joint statement, Chirac and Reagan said the Pasteur
Institute in Paris and the National Cancer Institute, of
Bethesda, Maryland, agreed to give part of the royalties from
the test to a new foundation dedicated to the wordwide fight
against AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome).
    "This agreement opens a new era in Franco-American
cooperation, allowing France and the United States to join
their efforts to control this terrible disease in the hopes of
speeding the development of an AIDS vaccine and cure," Reagan
said at the signing ceremony. 
    He said the two parties would share the patent and give 80
per cent of the royalties received to the new foundation.
    The foundation would also raise private funds and would
donate 25 per cent of its money to combat AIDS in less
developed countries. 
    Both leaders stressed the long ties between France and the
United States during a welcoming ceremony in the White House
East Room, with Reagan describing France as "America's oldest
ally in war and peace." 
    "I have come to tell you that we are remain motivated by the
same ideals of freedom, by the same will to face the dangers
which we both confront -- terrorism, war, hunger, poverty, new
diseases and drugs," Chirac replied.
    But the two countries are likely to have less to agree on
over the issue of trade, where Chirac is worried about a rise
in protectionism in the U.S. Congress. 
    A senior U.S. official yesterday dismissed a French idea to
sell cut-price grain to poor countries in Africa as a way of
lessening surplus stocks.
    Chirac is expected to canvass support for the idea, first
proposed by French Agriculture Minister Francois Guillaume,
during his two-day visit to Washington.
    The U.S. official described the idea as a "grain producers'
OPEC" -- a reference to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries -- and said it went against the Reagan
administration's desire to lessen government intervention in
trade.

United States and Japan is just the kind of shock that
economists say could send world stock markets into a tailspin.
    But they are not so sure if that would be a brief
corrective dip, or whether this week's falling share prices
mark the start of a "bear" market.
    "It's the billion dollar question," said Richard O'Brien,
economist at American Express International Bank in London.
    Japan's trade surplus -- 92.7 billion dlrs last year -- has
poured into share and bond markets around the world, and funded
a good chunk of the huge U.S. Budget deficit. Around a third of
any new sale of U.S. Treasury bonds has been bought by the
Japanese. However, Japanese investors have lost money as the
dollar falls and will lose more if the United States lets it
fall further to cut the trade deficit. The counterpart of
improving the trade deficit either through a lower dollar or
because the U.S. Increases duties on Japanese electronic goods,
may be to hit the capital inflow which has financed the budget
deficit.
   And if the U.S. Trade deficit does fall, the Japanese will
have less money to invest. To entice U.S. Investors to fill the
gap that would be left if the Japanese stopped buying U.S.
Bonds, interest rates would have to soar, O'Brien said. The
subsequent shift from shares to bonds could cause major falls
on the world stock markets.
    "A year ago, we could be pretty confident about the markets,"
said O'Brien. "Now, it is much less certain."
    Buoyant share prices are supposed to reflect a booming
economy. But the world economy, with sluggish growth at best in
the industrial nations, a massive load of Third World debt and
huge trade imbalances is not in good shape, said O'Brien.
    Nevertheless, New York analyst William Raferty, of Smith
Barney Harris Upham said  "We're still in a bull market," adding
that corrections are a normal part of a rising market and "The
bear usually strikes slowly."
    Economist Evelyn Brody, at Morgan Grenfell and Co in
London, said the huge sums of money going through the world
financial system will keep a floor under share and bond prices.
    Although interest by the Japanese in putting their money in
non-dollar denominated bonds and stocks has increased it's very
difficult to see where else they can put their money than in
U.S. Dollars and especially the U.S. Treasury (bond) market,
according to David Butcher, a senior executive at Yamaichi
Securities Co Ltd's bond operation in London.
    He said the Japanese are paying much closer attention now
to the French franc and West German mark.
    In the longer run, he worries about what trade tensions and
the dollar's slide will mean for securities markets.

opposition to protectionism and his chief spokesman said trade
sanctions imposed on Japan were unlikely to start a trade war.
    "We don't want to go down that road," Reagan was quoted as
telling Prime Minister Jacques Chirac after the visiting French
official expressed concern about the rising tide of
protectionist sentiment in the United States.
    Later, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater defended the
new sanctions against Japan and said administration officials
"do not believe this will result in a trade war."
    "It is the first time that the United States has taken an
action of this type and it is significant but it is nothing to
be alarmed about," the presidential spokesman added.
    "We do not want protectionism ... We do not want a trade
war," he said.
    Fitzwater said the president was forced to act in the
Japanese microchip case because Tokyo had failed to fulfill "an
agreement to make some corrections."
    Noting that there are "enormous pressures in the Congress
and the land" for the United States to take a tough stand, he
said, "This was a case where we felt we simply had to act."
    Fitzwater said the decision to impose sanctions was "well
considered by this administration and not taken lightly."
    While the White House official held open the possibility
that Washington and Tokyo will settle their trade dispute, he
indicated a settlement probably would not come in time to head
off the sanctions.
    "We are always open to negotations ... Whether it (a
settlement) could occur in time to prevent this (the sanctions)
from going into effect is questionable at this point," the
spokesman said.
    The sanctions take effect in mid-April.

sure the United States and Japan could work out their dispute
over unfair Japanese trade practices in semiconductor trade,
but "I am sure the sanctions will go in before we work it out."
    Sanctions are to be imposed on April 17.
    He also said he did not think there would be a trade war
with Japan, because Japan had too much value in exports to the
United States to risk such a war.
    "Those fears are unfounded," he said.
    He told reporters later that the sharp drop in the
securities market was not due to fears of a trade war, but fear
of inflation and that the Federal Reserve may act on that fact.
    Market reaction was also due, he said, to the drop in the
value of the dollar, although trade issues did have some
effect.
    Baldrige said that observers who were attributing the drop
in the market to trade sanctions were "barking up the wrong
tree."
    He said the market observers will realize this shortly.
    Baldrige said his remarks did not mean to suggest anything

Agriculture Committee said they will propose amendments
tomorrow to a pending trade bill increasing funding for the
export enhancement program, EEP, and significantly expanding
the scope of the program.
    At a press conference, Republican lawmakers said they would
propose expanding EEP to include all countries "willing to
purchase additional commodities at reasonable prices."
    In addition, the Congressmen said they would propose
extending the life of EEP to five years from the current three
years and increasing the EEP funding ceiling to 2.5 billion
dlrs from 1.5 billion at present.
    The Agriculture committee tomorrow will begin drafting
amendments to an omnibus trade bill now before the House.
    Responding to the Republican plan, Agriculture Secretary
Richard Lyng and Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said they
favor a flexible, targeted use of EEP instead of an
across-the-board program which they termed too costly.
    The Republican Congressmen also said they will offer an
amendment to the trade bill instructing the U.S. Agriculture
Department to value the bonus commodities used for EEP at the
market value, rather than the cost of acquisition.
    But Lyng said USDA already plans to change to market value
accounting rather than acquisition value, in order to avoid
hitting a funding ceiling for eep of 1.5 billion dlrs.
    Lyng said under market value accounting only about 700 mln
dlrs of EEP commodities have been used to date. Using
acquisition value, USDA officials said the value is higher.

Armacost will visit Tokyo next week for meetings with
high-level officials that will include talks on the growing
trade row over Japanese semiconductor electronics products.
    He is the first high-level U.S. official to visit Japan
since President Reagan announced last week plans to impose
tariffs worth up to 30 mln dlrs on Japanese electronic goods on
April 17 in retaliation for Tokyo's alleged failure to live up
to a pact on microchip trade signed last September.
    Deputy State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said the
trip is set for April 6 to 8.
    U.S.-Japanese talks of this kind are regularly held each

    The Armacost discussions with Deputy Foreign Minister
Ryohei Murata and other senior Japanese officials will focus on
U.S.-Japanese foreign aid programs and political security
issues of mutual concern, she added.
    "Although an exchange of views on bilateral relations is
expected, the talks are not directly related to U.S.-Japanese
trade relations," she insisted.
    But, in response to questions, Oakley acknowledged that
trade will be discussed.
   Japan's 58.6 billion dlrs trade surplus with the United

    A department official attributed the increase to growing
domestic investment by the private and public sectors. It is
expected to rise to 4.68 billion U.S. Dlrs from 3.79 billion a

widespread U.S. criticism of its trade policies by publishing
an extensive list of U.S. actions which pose obstacles to EC
exports.
    A spokeswoman for the EC Commission said the detailed
25-page report of alleged malpractices was in response to a
similar document issued by U.S. Administration officials in
November, and updated a previous EC list.
    EC External Trade Relations Commissioner Willy De Clercq
said its object was to show such actions were not solely taken
by trading partners of the U.S. And that "the U.S. Were not
innocents in the matter."
    The report covers the entire field of EC-U.S. Commercial
relations and lists more than 30 obstacles ranging from tariff
measures, import quotas, customs duties, anti-dumping
procedures, fiscal barriers and export subsidies.
    The Commission said not all the barriers mentioned were
necessarily inconsistent with U.S. International obligations,
and emphasised many of them could be removed at upcoming
international trade talks. "The purpose of the report is to make
clear that trade practices which impede exports are not a
unique problem only faced by U.S. Exporters. Europeans face
similar problems in the U.S.," it said.
    Among the obstacles detailed in the report are import
restrictions on food products, such as cheese, sugar and syrup,
certain wines, beers and juices, as well as on firearms and
machine tools.
    It also criticises programs to boost U.S. Cereals exports.
The document said the U.S.'s three-year export enhancement
program (EEP), which began in 1985, had subsidised exports of
9.7 mln tonnes of wheat, two mln tonnes of wheat flour and 2.8
mln tonnes of barley up to mid-March this year. The subsidies
granted so far were worth about 620 mln dlrs, it added.
    "The Community has already reacted where necessary to U.S.
EEP subsidies by increasing its exports refunds, and will
continue to do so," it said, adding the current GATT round would
also provide an opportunity to address the subject.
    The document also says import quotas maintained by the U.S.
On a range of farm products, including sugar, peanuts and
certain cottons, restrict EC exports.
    In addition, the report deplores a recent U.S.-Japan accord
on semi-conductors, export controls on technology transfers,
standards tests in the telecommunications arena and the U.S.
Administration's "buy American" public procurement policy.

interest rate increases and trade confrontations,
finance ministers and central bankers meet next week to discuss
a deteriorating global debt and economic situation.
    The meetings, under the auspices of the International
Monetary Fund and World Bank, come as interest rates are
turning higher and the already-weak dollar has sunk further,
upsetting bond and stock markets.
    Uncertainty is growing about the vitality of the global
economy and whether the heavily-indebted countries can continue
to carry the burden of their growing debt without vast new
assistance.
    Monetary and diplomatic sources said there are no signs
any new debt initiative of the sort that Treasury Secretary
James Baker unveiled 18 months ago in Seoul is in the works.
    The strategy has drawn a serious challenge from Brazil,
which suspended interest payments on 67 billion dlrs of
commercial bank debt last month. The Banks have responded by
laying the groundwork for writing down Brazilian loans.
    Separately, French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, in a
visit earlier this week with President Reagan, sounded out the
administration on a plan to funnel worldwide grain surpluses to
the very poorest states.
    The French plan is certain to be discussed by the ministers
in detail during next week's meetings and will undoubtedly be
embraced by the developing countries.
    "There's interest on the part of some countries for looking
at the support of the special problems of the very poorest
countries, because their position is so extreme," a Reagan
administration official said.
    He suggested Washington was open to disussing the issue.
    The meetings will also assess the success of the Baker debt
initiative, which called for new funding to help debtor
countries grow out of their problems.
    The largest industrial countries have been attempting to
coordinate economic policy in the hope of controlling the
decline of the dollar, U.S. trade and budget deficits and other
problems.
    At the same time, the industrial countries see little
evidence of a strengthening of economic activity and the Fund
forecasts they will grow 2.5 pct.
    The United States sees 3.2 pct growth for itself, 
continuing its expansion for a fifth year, and has asked other
industrial countries to stimulate their economies.
    These issues directly affect the debt problem and the
ability of the debtor countries to grow out of their
difficulties.
    In recent years, U.S. markets have absorbed the exports of
developing country, allowing them to earn critical foreign
exchange. But the United States wants to cut its trade deficit,
running at a record 169.8 billion dlrs, and is pressing others
to import more from developing countries.
    The discussions, from April six to 10, will be
wide-ranging, touching everything from interest rates to the
impact of development loans on the environment, according to
monetary sources.
    The talks will include an examination of trade
protectionist pressures in the wake of a decision by the Reagan
administration to place some 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on
microchip products from Japan, the sources said.
    The move accelerated the dollar's decline as financial
markets grew alarmed that trade war was in the offing.
    There is concern that the action, prompted by U.S. charges
that Japan has been selling computer chip products below fair
market value and has kept its own market closed to imports,
further undermining the international trading system.
    At the same time, the ministers will discuss the
fundamental price weakness in basic commodities, the export
mainstay of many developing countries.
    The so-called Group of Five industrial countries -- the
United States, Japan, West Germany, France and Britain -- will
gather for the first time since their February talks in Paris,
where they agreed to keep the dollar from sliding further.
    The Five will be joined later by Italy and Canada for
further debate on economic policy coordination.
    As part of the Paris accord, surplus countries such as
Japan agreed to stimulate their economies, while America
said it would reduce its federal budget deficit.
    Other major issues of the meetings include a U.S. bid to to
have a larger say in approving loans of the Inter-American
Development Bank, strengthening the link between loans and
economic policy changes in debtor nations.
    Washington is also pressing the World Bank to take more
account of the environment when making loan for dams and other
projects.
    The new head of the Bank, Barber Conable, has said this
issue is being reviewed and will be part of a reorganization
plan for the Bank, now being prepared.

expressed concern that trade protectionism, at the heart of a
new showdown between the United States and Japan, might spread
throughout the industrial world.
    But in an interview with Reuters, Conable said the action
by the United States to slap tariffs on certain electronic
goods from Japan did not mean the countries were heading for a
full-scale trade war.
    Conable said the World Bank has been pressing developing
countries to open their markets, arguing that a free trading
environment increased the possibility of global economic
growth.
    "We have, in fact, been making adjustment loans to many
countries in the developing world which have encouraged the
opening of their markets and we want to be sure that the
developed world doesn't close at the same time," he said.
    He said the U.S. action against Japan was "a significant
retaliatory step but it did not constitute a basic change in
trade policy."
    The interview came just before next week's semi-annual
meetings of the Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
    Referring to Brazil's recent interest payments moratorium,
Conable also said the global debt situation was very serious
and must be closely watched.
    He said the Bank, which in the past has concentrated on
making loans that assist the basic underpinnings in the
developing world such as dams, roads and sewers, will
increasingly make assistance available for economic reform.
    The Bank has increased these loans, in part because of the
debt crisis that has found countries desperately in need of new
funds for balance of payments adjustment and economic reforms
aimed at opening their markets, encouraging foreign investment
and reducing government's role in the economy.
    "We're comfortable with adjustment lending, we expect,
however, that it will never reach a majority of our portfolio,"
Conable said.
    He made clear, however, that adjustment lending would
continue to increase as a proportion of overall Bank lending
for some time.
    He noted, "the problem of debt was a severe one and many
countries are asking for adjustment assistance because of the
problem of debt."
    Conable, is a a former Republican Congressman from New York
chosen by President Reagan for the Bank position last year. He
is an associate of Treasury Secertary James Baker who launched
the U.S. strategy for shoring up indebted nations in October,
1985 which included a call for increased adjustment lending by
the World Bank.
    Conable also said that he expected the result of a major
study of the Bank's organization to be completed in the next
several weeks.
    He said the decision to seek a reorganization was based, in
part, on the fact that the Bank had come under fire from the
poorest countries for not doing enough to help and from the
richest countries because of inefficiency.
    the reorganization is considered a major initiative by
Conable, and is being closely-watched by the agency's 151
member-countries as an indication of his management style and
priorities.
    "I want to be sure this institution is viewed by those who
must support it as soundly constituted so that it will be
permitted to grow," Conable said.
    However, he said "I don't believe there is anything
basically wrong with this institution and I don't believe it
has to have any redefinition of its purpose."
    He said, however, that it was apparent that the debt
initiative proposed by Baker has given the Bank a central role
in dealing with the debt crisis.
    Conable added that cooperation between the Bank and its
sister agency, the International Monetary Fund, was good and
that he talked often with IMF Managing Director Michel
Camdessus on a variety of issues.
    On a personal level, Conable said that he not feel a need
to put his personal stamp on the Bank noting that "I don't have
a particular mission here except to be useful to the
institution and to the process of development."
    He added, "so I don't feel a great calling to personalize
the institution."
    On the development needs of sub-Sahara Africa, Conable said
that the Bank was constantly reviewing new ways for assisting
the region, noting that half of the recently agreed financing
of 12.4 billion dlrs for Bank's International Development
Association was earmarked for Africa.
    Leading industrial nations are expected to consider new
forms of debt relief for the very poorest nations, like those
in the Sub-Sahara, during next week's meetings.

Howard told Japan to resolve the row over the U.K. Firm Cable
and Wireless Plc's <CAWL.L> shareholding in a new Japanese
telecommunications company or face an abrupt deterioration in
trade relations.
    In meetings with both the foreign and telecommunications
ministers Howard said he expressed deep concern about the way
Tokyo had handled the dispute and about the continuing trade
imbalance between the two countries.
    "I put it to the (post and telecommunications) minister that
I was sure he did not want to be responsible for an abrupt
deterioration in the trading relations of our countries which
would have widespread reverberations elsewhere in the world,"
Howard told reporters.
    "He listened very carefully and I have little doubt the
message got home," he added.
    British frustration over the lopsided trade balance -
nearly six billion dlrs in Japan's favour last year - has
reached boiling point over the telecommunications issue, Howard
said.
    Howard has accused Japan of trying to shut out Cable and
Wireless from having a major role in the international
telephone market in Japan.
    "I want a fair crack of the whip for Cable and Wireless as I
want a fair crack of the whip for Britain generally in trading
relations," Howard said. "We simply aren't prepared to continue
to accept the imbalance which has been the position for such a
long time."
    Post and Telecommunications Ministry officials were unable
to comment on Howard's meeting with their minister.
    But Foreign Ministry officials said Foreign Minister
Tadashi Kuranari said that British exports to Japan are
increasing, but acknowledged the continuing imbalance in trade.
    Kuranari said he wants everyone in the telecommunications
dispute, including Cable and Wireless, to be satisfied.
    Howard told reporters that Britain was actively considering
possible retaliatory measures if it did not get its way on the
telecommunications issue.
    "There are measures which are under consideration if we
continue to suffer from the imbalance in our trading relations,"
he added, but gave no details.
    He said he had received a reassuring response from the
Japanese he has spoken with.
    "But of course we've had reassuring signs from the Japanese
for quite some time," he added. "What I've made plain is we
expect to see action."
    Howard ruled out using powers in Britain's Financial

stronger powers for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT) to enforce world trade rules.
    The call by U.S. Deputy Trade Representative Michael Smith
at a special committee meeting into the future of GATT follows
a series of bilateral trade rows which have clouded efforts by
the 93-nation body to promote fair trade.
    Today's meeting was part of the Uruguay trade round
launched by ministers last September. The round, which covers
13 areas of trade in agriculture, manufactured goods and
services will take four years to negotiate.
    Smith called for boosting GATT's links with financial
institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and World
Bank. He also urged greater involvement of trade ministers to
ensure the success of the Uruguay Round.
    "The GATT as an institution needs to be strengthened to
assure that the GATT plays its proper role in management of the
world trading system and the global economy," Smith said.
    "Rules can and will be ignored if the institution is weak,
or perceived as unable to adapt to the changing world economy."
    He also also urged that member states be accountable to
each other for their trade policies.
    Smith, who flies to Brussels today for talks with European
Community (EC) officials, told Reuters the committee wanted to
stress GATT's importance and did not discuss specifics.
    "We are interested in more periodic ministerial
involvement...Whether in formal or informal meetings," he said.
    GATT's ruling council is due to hear a complaint from the
12-nation EC on April 15 about the U.S.-Japanese accord on
semiconductors. The EC charges the accord breached GATT trade
rules by allowing Tokyo to set minimum prices for Japanese
chips sold in third countries and is requesting a GATT dispute
panel be set up to review the agreement.
    President Reagan, who strongly supported the Uruguay trade
round to promote freer trade, has said Washington will impose
tariffs against Japanese electronic goods.
    He said Tokyo had not shown willingness to open its markets
to U.S. Exports.

Volcker said that debtor nations have made much progress in
laying the groundwork for economic growth, but a solution to
world debt difficulties was endangered by inaction on new
financing.
    "There is clearly a danger that adequate financing
arrangements are not being negotiated and put in place in a
timely way," Volcker told the Senate Banking Committee.
    The borrowing countries need to be able to proceed with
confidence that the necessary funds will be available to them,
he said.
    Brazil has the potential for becoming a leading world
economic power, but it is in a difficult position today,
Volcker said.
    He said it will take a concerted effort to regularize
Brazil's external payments.
    "The key prerequisite is clearly in the hands of Brazilian
authorities," he said.
    Both Brazil and its creditors have a strong incentive to
work together, Volcker said.
    Regarding trade imbalances, Volcker said that it was
critically important that markets be kept open by the
industrial nations.
    In addition, the United States must reduce its budget
deficit and foreign nations need to provide stimulus to their
domestic economies, Volcker said.
    "We need time for those actions and the earlier
depreciation to work their effects," he said.

semiconductor production to forstall the 300 mln dlrs in U.S.
tariffs on Japanese electronic goods set to take effect April
17, industry analysts said.
    The move is likely to create a sharp price rise and a
possible shortage of the key computer components in the next
few weeks, the analysts said.
    "Prices have gone up for memory components, the mainstay of
the Japanese semiconductor industry," analyst Drew Peck of
Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette said.
    But analysts said the price rises have been slight so far,
and some questioned whether Japan would be successful in
forcing Japanese companies to cut production in the long run.
    Others, however, were more optimistic, saying evidence was
already in hand that Japan has cut back prodution and halted
sales to the grey market, the third country brokers that sell
chips at below production costs.
    "We've seen the grey market begin to dry up for D-RAMS, and
it has virtually dried up for EPROMS," said Merrill Lynch
analyst Thomas Kurlack of the two key memory chips used in
computers.
    "Prices are inching up and lead times on deliveries are
stretching," Kurlack added.
    Industry analysts said Japan's Ministry of International
Trade and Industry, or MITI, had requested the cut backs in
production to meet the terms of last year's semiconductor
accord with the U.S.
    The Reagan adminsitration recently proposed tariffs on
Japanese electronic goods, alleging that Japan had failed to
live up to the accord and continued to dump the computer
components in the U.S. market.
    But some analysts said Japan's attempt to mollify the U.S.
was a double edged sword, and might be read at a subtle form of
trade retaliation for the tariffs proposed by the U.S.
    As production in Japan is cut, these analysts argue, prices
will rise in the U.S. and few American semiconductor
manufactures will be able to take up the slack since most long
ago exited the market for memory chips. U.S. computer makers
that use the chips in their machines will then be pressured.
    "The Japanese are looking for ways to reduce trade
pressures from Washington, but at the same time they're
demonstating their muscle," analyst Peck said.
    The cut backs in Japanese production are expected to
benefit U.S. chip makers.
    "I think this could be a very important factor for U.S.
semiconductor manufacturers," industry analyst Elliot Levine of
Ladenburg Thalmann Co said.
    But analyst Peck said, "it will take a few weeks to see
whether Japan has genuinely cut production."
    He said Japanese manufactures were likely to view MITI's
request unfavorably because chip capacity was still high and
production cut backs would lead to significant write-offs in
plant and equipment.

    In a briefing ahead of this week's semiannual IMF and World

    He reaffirmed the U.S. would press ahead with efforts to
reduce its budget deficit, resist protectionism and boost U.S.

    The official also said that he expected trade issues, like
the dispute between the U.S. and Japan over microchips, to be
included in the discussions.
    The official made no direct comment on the content or
schedule of forthcoming Group of Five and Group of Seven
discussions. He said that industrial countries are concerned
that the large external imbalances remain a threat to the
international monetary system.
    He added that the meetings will also provide an opportunity
to discuss economic policy coordination efforts.
    The official said indicators would be used to measure
policy objectives of industrial countries and their economic
projections.
    They would also be used to assess progress of policy goals.
    Asked whether the U.S. was proposing a new initiative
regarding the indicators, the official said the issue would be

Ontario today asked their U.S. counterparts to exempt Canada
from the mandatory trade retaliation provisions in a major
trade bill being considered by the U.S. Congress.
    At a meeting of the Northeast-Midwest Coalition, an
organization of U.S. legislators, David Cooke, chairman of the
Ontario Parliament's Select Committee on Economic Affairs, said
the exemption would help trade relations.
    The trade legislation to be considered by the full House in
late April would require President Reagan to retaliate against
foreign unfair trade practices unless the trade actions would
harm the U.S. economy.
    Currently, Reagan can reject trade sanctions on any
grounds.
    Cooke, a member of the Liberal party, told the U.S.
congressmen, "I can understand (the trade bill). I think it has
to do with concerns you have with the other parts of the world."
    "I would suggest to you that we are your best friends. You
do not have those concerns with Canada and you should sincerely
consider exempting our country from that bill," he added.
    Canada is the United States' largest trading partner, with
two-way trade more than 113 billion dlrs in 1985, according to
the coalition. But the U.S. ran up a 23 billion dlr deficit in
manufactured goods that year compared to a 14 billion dlr
surplus in services trade with its neighbour.

U.S. And Japan has raised fears among many of Asia's exporting
nations that the row could inflict far-reaching economic
damage, businessmen and officials said.
    They told Reuter correspondents in Asian capitals a U.S.
Move against Japan might boost protectionist sentiment in the
U.S. And lead to curbs on American imports of their products.
    But some exporters said that while the conflict would hurt
them in the long-run, in the short-term Tokyo's loss might be
their gain.
    The U.S. Has said it will impose 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on
imports of Japanese electronics goods on April 17, in
retaliation for Japan's alleged failure to stick to a pact not
to sell semiconductors on world markets at below cost.
    Unofficial Japanese estimates put the impact of the tariffs
at 10 billion dlrs and spokesmen for major electronics firms
said they would virtually halt exports of products hit by the
new taxes.
    "We wouldn't be able to do business," said a spokesman for
leading Japanese electronics firm Matsushita Electric
Industrial Co Ltd <MC.T>.
    "If the tariffs remain in place for any length of time
beyond a few months it will mean the complete erosion of
exports (of goods subject to tariffs) to the U.S.," said Tom
Murtha, a stock analyst at the Tokyo office of broker <James
Capel and Co>.
    In Taiwan, businessmen and officials are also worried.
    "We are aware of the seriousness of the U.S. Threat against
Japan because it serves as a warning to us," said a senior
Taiwanese trade official who asked not to be named.
    Taiwan had a trade trade surplus of 15.6 billion dlrs last
year, 95 pct of it with the U.S.
    The surplus helped swell Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves
to 53 billion dlrs, among the world's largest.
    "We must quickly open our markets, remove trade barriers and
cut import tariffs to allow imports of U.S. Products, if we
want to defuse problems from possible U.S. Retaliation," said
Paul Sheen, chairman of textile exporters <Taiwan Safe Group>.
    A senior official of South Korea's trade promotion
association said the trade dispute between the U.S. And Japan
might also lead to pressure on South Korea, whose chief exports
are similar to those of Japan.
    Last year South Korea had a trade surplus of 7.1 billion
dlrs with the U.S., Up from 4.9 billion dlrs in 1985.
    In Malaysia, trade officers and businessmen said tough
curbs against Japan might allow hard-hit producers of
semiconductors in third countries to expand their sales to the
U.S.
    In Hong Kong, where newspapers have alleged Japan has been
selling below-cost semiconductors, some electronics
manufacturers share that view. But other businessmen said such
a short-term commercial advantage would be outweighed by
further U.S. Pressure to block imports.
    "That is a very short-term view," said Lawrence Mills,
director-general of the Federation of Hong Kong Industry.
    "If the whole purpose is to prevent imports, one day it will
be extended to other sources. Much more serious for Hong Kong
is the disadvantage of action restraining trade," he said.
    The U.S. Last year was Hong Kong's biggest export market,
accounting for over 30 pct of domestically produced exports.
    The Australian government is awaiting the outcome of trade
talks between the U.S. And Japan with interest and concern,
Industry Minister John Button said in Canberra last Friday.
    "This kind of deterioration in trade relations between two
countries which are major trading partners of ours is a very
serious matter," Button said.
    He said Australia's concerns centred on coal and beef,
Australia's two largest exports to Japan and also significant
U.S. Exports to that country.
    Meanwhile U.S.-Japanese diplomatic manoeuvres to solve the
trade stand-off continue.
    Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party yesterday outlined
a package of economic measures to boost the Japanese economy.
    The measures proposed include a large supplementary budget
and record public works spending in the first half of the
financial year.
    They also call for stepped-up spending as an emergency
measure to stimulate the economy despite Prime Minister
Yasuhiro Nakasone's avowed fiscal reform program.

open talks with American trade negotiators in a last-ditch
effort to avert new high U.S. tariffs to be imposed on a wide
variety of Japanese electronic exports.
    Makoto Kuroda, vice minister of Japan's Ministry of
International Trade and Industry (MITI), is to hold two days of
meetings with the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, Michael
Smith, and the Under Secretary of Commerce, Bruce Smart.
    The new tariffs, to go into effect on April 17, are in
retaliation for Japan's failure to adhere to an agreement to
end dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost and
to open its home market to U.S. semiconductor shipments.
    They are to be imposed on goods which use semiconductors,
including television and audio equipment and computers.
    Both U.S. and Japanese officials have said there was little
likelihood the talks would do anything to avert the 100 pct
duties on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese shipments.
    President Reagan announced the planned tariffs on March 27
after he said that close monitoring of the July 1986
U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact convinced U.S. officials that
Japan was not honoring the agreement.
    In making the annoucement, Reagan said "I am committed to
the full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to
provide American industry with free and fair trade."
    Trade analysts said his move was aimed as much at Japan's
semiconductor trade practices, which are said to have injured
the U.S. semiconductor industry, as Congress, which has
complained about presidential timidity on trade issues.
    Congressional Democrats have pledged to enact aggressive
trade laws to counter what they contend has been Reagan's
inaction to redress the growing U.S. trade deficit, which last
year reached 169.8 billion dlrs.
    About one-third of the deficit was with Japan.
    Reagan said there were recent signs Japan was beginning to
adhere to the pact and that was why he was not terminating it.
    Kuroda said on leaving Tokyo today he had no new proposals
but did have an explanation of the semiconductor situation.
    He told the daily newspaper Ashai Shimbun that Reagan's
decision was based on inaccurate data and an exaggerated sense
of MITI's power to control Japanese traders.
    "The United States has excessive expectations.," he said. To
stabilize supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by
excess inventories since 1985 will take some time."
    He also said that U.S. firms had not been aggressive enough
in trying to sell in the Japanese market.

 ]]></BODY><BODY><![CDATA[Financial analysts say they are
pleased with congressional moves to trim next year's federal
budget deficit but believe the actions will do little to help
improve the U.S. trade deficit or buoy the economy.
    The House of Representatives is expected to vote tomorrow
to approve a trillion-dollar budget blueprint for the coming
fiscal year that reduces the deficit by 38 billion dlrs.
    Similarly, the Senate Budget Committee has approved a plan
that would cut federal red ink by about 37 billion dlrs next
year.
        "In terms of the economy, 37-38 billion dlrs is
infinitesimal, so cuts of this magnitude will have little
impact on the economy and the trade deficit," said Stanley
Collander, a Touche Ross federal budget policy analyst.
    "At best, it will have a small positive effect," Collander
said in an interview.
    Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker has repeatedly
told Congress that cutting federal red ink would go a long way
to help reduce the massive trade deficit and also help ease
some of the downward pressure on the value of the dollar.
    The U.S. government has attempted to remedy the trade
imbalance by driving down the value of the dollar. But Volcker
has warned that a further fall in the dollar's value is fraught
with danger.
    Such a decline, he has said, could refuel inflation as
imported goods become more expensive and chase away foreign
capital needed to finance the federal budget deficit.
    In addition, in February, U.S. officials meeting with other
major industrialized nations in Paris agreed that the value of
the dollar had dropped enough and that world exchange rates
should be stabilized at around current levels.
    As part of that agreement, Japan and West Germany agreed to
take steps to stimulate their economies and the United States
agreed to cut its budget deficit.
    The alternative to driving down the dollar any further as a
way to deal with the trade deficit, Volcker said recently, is
to reduce U.S. consumption, particularly federal spending.
    "If you don't deal with the budget deficit, everything else
you do is going to be counterproductive," Volcker said in recent
testimony before the Senate Banking Committee.
    Volcker also said he would prefer to further tighten the
government's purse strings than have the Fed tighten the credit
supply if action was needed to fight inflationary pressures or
to assure the continued flow of foreign capital into the United
States.
    Analysts say that Fed tightening now could choke off the
current modest economic expansion and threaten a recession.
    Kemper Financial Services economist John Silvia stressed
that any deficit reduction was better than none.
    But he said the size of the cuts under consideration were 
not enough to give the Federal Reserve Board the flexibility it
needs to steer the economy or to keep the value of the dollar
from plunging further in world exchange markets.
    "There's no doubt that some deficit reduction helps, but if
your objective is to stabilize the dollar and perserve the
Fed's flexibility to conduct monetary policy, then the answer
is, it's not enough," Silvia told Reuters.
    The U.S. trade deficit has become one of the government's
most vexing and persistent problems.
    The 1986 deficit was 169.8 billion dlrs and there is as yet
little indication that this year's figure will be any lower,
though administration officials have predicted it will drop by
about 20 to 30 billion dlrs by year's end.
    In the past, Volcker has joked that he never lost sleep
worrying whether Congress would cut too much fat from the
federal budget.
    On the other hand, he also has made it clear he is not
attached to the gradually declining deficit ceilings set for
the 1986-1991 period by last year's Gramm-Rudman balanced
budget law.
    While the new law set a ceiling of 108 billion dlrs for
next year's federal deficit, both the House and Senate Budget
Committees have conceded that their budget plans would fall
short of the deficit reduction goal by about 25 billion dlrs.
    "For political reasons, 35 to 40 billion dlrs is about the
most you're going to get" out of Congress at the present time,
said Touche Ross's Collander. "To do something more than that
would be extraordinary, remarkable and very, very difficult."
    Collander said the real danger for Congress was to end up
short of the deficit reduction goal set by its Budget panels.
    "To an extent, this has become the minimum acceptable
reduction level," he explained. "Anything less than that will now
look like a failure to Wall Street."
    The budget plan now under debate on the House floor would
lower an estimated 171 billion dlr deficit for the year
beginning on October one to about 133 billion dlrs by cutting
defense and domestic programs by 38 billion dlrs from their
anticipated spending levels for next year.
    The Senate Budget Committee has called for a deficit of
nearly 134 billion dlrs with about 18.5 billion dlrs in new 
taxes and about the same amount in spending cuts.

considerably, underscoring economists' predictions the sector
would post a long awaited recovery this year.
    The federal government reported today that the monthly
surplus soared to 1.25 billion Canadian dlrs in February,
double January's 623 mln dlrs surplus and sharply higher than
February 1986's 189 mln dlr tally.
    "Hopefully it's the beginning of a trend," said Richardson
Greenshields of Canada Ltd economist Susan Clark in Toronto.
    Economists generally don't expect such large gains over the
next months, but are looking for an upward trend throughout the
year.
    "We thought the trade balance would improve ... over the
year, and it certainly looks as if this morning's figure is
indicative of that," commented economist James Donegan at the
Toronto securities firm of Midland Doherty Ltd.
    Statistics Canada reported the surplus was driven by a 23
pct gain in automobile product exports to a record 3.2 billion
dls in the month.
    "Recovery in the automotive sector helped push the value of
exports up by 5.9 pct in February," the agency said in its
monthly report.
    Total exports expanded to 10.44 billion dlrs from 9.85
billion dlrs in February, while imports slipped to 9.19 billion
dlrs from 9.23 billion dlrs.
    Economists have predicted the 1987 trade surplus would end
up three to five billion dlrs higher than last year's dismal
10.1 billion dlr total. In 1985 the surplus was 17.48 billion

    Money market analysts said the positive trade news touched
off a modest rally in the Canadian dollar, which rose to 76.85
U.S. cts on North American markets early this morning after

    Economists have been banking on an improved trade
performance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish
Canadian economy.
    They say the country's consumers, who have been spending at
a torrid pace in recent years, will sharply curtail outlays
this year and this should help curtail the flow of imports into
the country.
    Meanwhile, demand for Canadian exports in the United
States, by far the country's largest market, is expected to be
strong as a result of a projected rise in American consumer
spending and the relatively low value of the Canadian currency.
    "We maintain what's going to drive Canada's export
performance is income growth in the U.S.," said Midland's
Donegan.
    But at the Bank of Nova Scotia, deputy chief economist
Warren Jestin was less optimistic about the U.S. outlook and
said it could be a mistake to read too much into February's
trade upturn.
    Jestin said, "Given the fact the U.S. economy is showing
signs of weakening--particularly car sales--it would indicate
that part of the strength (in Canada's trade figures) is
probably transitory."

take retaliatory measures if the United States imposes its
planned trade sanctions on April 17, a senior government
official said.
    Shinji Fukukawa, Vice Minister of the International Trade
and Industry Ministry, said in a statement Japan would consider
measures under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and
other actions if the United States imposes 100 pct tariffs on
some Japanese exports as planned next week.
    However, Fukukawa said Japan was ready to continue trade
talks with the United States despite its failure to convince
America to call off the threatened tariffs during two days of
emergency talks which ended in Washington yesterday.
    Last month President Reagan announced the sanctions in
retaliation for what he called Japan's failure to honour a July
1986 agreement to stop dumping computer microchips in markets
outside the United States and to open its home market to
American goods.
    Fukukawa said the United States had regrettably not
listened to Japan's explanation of its efforts to live up the
pact and said Washington had not given any detailed explanation
of why it planned to impose the tariffs.

of import tariff cuts on 862 foreign goods shortly before trade
talks with Washington which officials described as a move to
help balance trade with the United States.
    Wang Der-Hwa, Deputy Director of the Finance Ministry's
Customs Administration Department, told reporters the list of
products included 60 items asked by Washington.
    "The move is part of our government efforts to encourage
imports from our trading partners, particularly from the United
States," he said.
    He said the ministry sent a proposal today to the cabinet
that the tariffs on such products as cosmetics, bicycles,
apples, radios, garments, soybeans and television sets be cut
by between five and 50 pct.
    The cabinet was expected to give its approval next Thursday
and the new tariff cuts would be implemented possibly starting
on April 20, he added.
    Taiwan introduced a sweeping tariff cut on some 1,700
foreign products last January aimed at helping reduce its
growing trade surplus with the United States, the island's
largest trading partner.
    Washington however was not satisfied with the cuts and
pressed for more reductions as a way of cutting its huge trade
deficit with Taipei.
    Washington's deficit with Taipei rose to a record 13.6
billion U.S. Dlrs last year from 10.2 billion in 1985. It
widened to 3.61 billion in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.78
billion a year earlier, Taiwan's official figures show.
    Today's announcement came before a departure later today of
a 15-member Taiwan delegation for Washington for a series of
trade talks with U.S. Officials.
    The delegation's leader, Vincent Siew, told reporters last
night he was leaving with "a heavy heart," meaning that he would
face tough talks in Washington because of rising protectionist
sentiments in the U.S. Congress. Taiwan's 1986 trade surplus
with Washington was the third largest, after Japan and Canada.
    Siew said the talks, starting on April 14, would cover U.S.
Calls for Taiwan to open its market to American products,
purchases of major U.S. Machinery and power plant equipment,
import tariff cuts and protection of intellectual property.
    "I am afraid this time we have to give more than take from
our talks with the U.S.," he said without elaborating.

Japanese government a clear warning of sanctions against
Japanese companies if Tokyo did not allow more access to its
internal markets "and it was clearly understood."
    Corporate Affairs Minister Michael Howard said on his
return from a visit to Japan he thought the Japanese were
beginning to appreciate the need to be "fair and open" about
access to their own markets.
    At an airport news conference Howard denied opposition
charges that his trip had been a failure because he had
returned empty-handed.
    "I did what I set out to do. I was sent to deliver a clear
message to the Japanese government, and I delivered it very
clearly, and it has been clearly understood."
    Howard said that under the Financial Services Act the
govenment had considerable flexibility in taking sanctions
against Japanese companies and finance houses operating in
Britain.
    "It is not simply a question of withdrawing or refusing
operating licences. We can ban firms from certain countries
from carrying out certain kinds of business, while allowing
them to carry out other kinds."
    "I hope we don't have to use these powers, but I made it
clear in Japan that if our timetable isn't met, we shall use
them."
    He said it would be unfortunate if Britain and Japan became
involved in a tit-for-tat exchange, adding that Japan gained
more than anyone else from an open trading relationship.
    "I think they are beginning to appreciate that if this
relationship is to continue, it is very important for them to
be fair and open about access to their own markets."
    On the question of the British firm Cable and Wireless Plc
<CAWL.L>, which is trying to win a significant share of
telecommunications contracts in Japan, Howard said he had told
the Japanese this was being widely regarded as a test case.
    He said there were signs of movement on the case. Cable and
Wireless was due to take part in talks in Japan next Tuesday,
he said.
    Earlier this week British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
said Britain could not go it alone on sanctions against Japan,
but would have to coordinate action with its European Community
partners.
    Community sources said after a meeting of trade officials
yesterday that the group might impose steep new tariffs on a
range of Japanese goods to prevent diversion from United States
markets if Washington imposes trade sanctions against Tokyo as
it has threatened.

Community are starting to run out of patience with Japan which
they believe has repeatedly promised major initiatives to open
its market to imports, but as often made only minor moves.
    Diplomatic sources here said several recent actions by EC
countries bear witness to a new disillusionment with the
willingness, or at least the ability, of the Japanese
government to reduce its massive trade surplus with the EC.
    However, they said an all-out trade war may be far off, as
EC states know they would suffer almost as much as Japan.
    Senior EC diplomats gave a generally favourable reaction to
an EC executive commission proposal under which the EC could
raise tariffs on a range of Japanese products if the U.S.
Carries out a threat to make a similar move on April 17.
    The EC tariffs, which would involve renouncing obligations
entered into with the world trade body GATT, would be designed
to stop a diversion of exports to the EC market from that of
the U.S.
    The diplomats were meeting as Tokyo announced that the EC's
trade deficit with Japan reached a record 2.13 billion dlrs in
March, up from 1.94 billion in February.
    In 1986, Japanese exports to the EC totalled 30.67 billion
dlrs, up 4.5 pct from 1985, while EC exports to Japan fell one
pct to 12.43 billion dlrs.
    In Paris, trade minister Michel Noir said France has
decided to give Japan a taste of its own medicine.
    Burgeoning imports of microwave ovens and of frozen
Coquilles St Jacques will be restricted by a strict application
of French quality standards -- something EC states say often
happens to their own exports entering Japan.
    Britain has threatened to withdraw the licences of Japanese
banks and insurance companies to operate in the City of London,
because the British Cable and Wireless company lost out in
competition for a Japanese telecommucations contract.
    However, British officials in London have said that the
government may have gone too far in implying that it would take
immediate drastic action unless the contract was reopened.
    By contrast, West Germany, with the EC's most successful
economy, has never threatened Tokyo with sanctions, preferring
to rely on firm diplomacy and encouragement of its own
industries to surmount obstacles to export to Japan.
    The EC Commission itself has switched its tactics in recent
years, substituting general calls for action by Japan to open
its market with specific demands for moves in key areas.
    At present, it is, for instance, pressuring Japan to end
allegedly discriminatory taxation of imported wines and
spirits, to ensure EC companies have a chance to win contracts
for the building of a new international airport, and to
simplify certification and safety checks on imported cars.
    EC officials say these tactics yield some benefits, but
often the Japanese announce modifications of their non-tariff
barriers which open the door to imports by only a token amount.
    They stress, however, that any action must be taken by the
EC as a whole to stop beggar-my-neighbour action.
    One of the problems Britain could face if it were to
withdraw licences for Japanese banks would be that the bankers
would be welcomed with open arms in Frankfurt or Amsterdam,
they point out.

effectively given Japan six weeks to take moves to open its
market to imports before it decides on possible tough
retaliatory trade measures, EC diplomats said.
    They said EC foreign ministers will meet on May 25 and 26
to review the state of trade relations between the two sides.
    The EC executive commission was asked by representatives of
member states on Friday to propose a renunciation of some EC
pledges to the world trade body, GATT, unless there are
"adequate and early measures to open the Japanese market."
    Such a renunciation would be the first step to imposing
stiff increases in duties, or quantitative limits, on Japanese
exports.
    The diplomats said it was unlikely that the issue would be
discussed in detail at the next meeting of EC foreign ministers
on April 27 and 28 in Luxembourg as time was needed to prepare
proposals for possible retaliatory action.
    They said the commission has powers to take some limited
action before getting ministerial approval to prevent Japanese
exports of electrical, photographic and other goods being
diverted to Europe following of possible U.S. Tariff moves.
    In May, the ministers are also likely to discuss how to
prevent Japan from getting an extra trading advantage as a
result of Spain and Portugal joining the bloc, which obliges
them gradually to reduce tariffs on many industrial goods.

sector is a key to shifting its economy away from export to
domestic-led growth, a vital step if it is to trim its trade
surplus, securities analysts said.
    The farm sector, which is protected by import tariffs and
quotas, propped up by subsidies and price supports, and
sheltered by the tax system, has ample room for change, they
said.
    "In economic terms, reform would be a plus," said Christopher
Chew of brokerage firm James Capel and Co.
    The ultimate cost of the existing system is food prices
twice those in Europe and two to three times those in the U.S.,
The analysts said.
    Spending on food accounts for about one quarter of the
average household's budget and roughly 10 pct of the gross
national product (GNP), according to a study by Chew.
    Reducing these prices could increase household spending
power by five pct, his study said. The money could be spent on
products which would have a more direct impact in boosting
domestic growth, it added.
    "There's a lot of slack," a U.S. Government official in Tokyo
said. "All that money could be spent on something else."
    Direct central government subsidies to the farm sector
amount to some five billion dlrs per year. Independent
estimates put total subsidies from all sources as high as 37
billion and the analysts said much of that money is wasted.
    Changing tax laws to encourage city residents who only farm
on weekends to put their land up for sale for residential
development would also give a boost to domestic spending,
economists said.
    "Housing construction is the key strategic variable in the
expansion of domestic demand," wrote Chihiro Nakajima, professor
at Kyoto Gakuen University.
    Japanese business groups are calling for staged farm reform
to shift some of the burden of trade friction and economic
restructuring away from the manufacturing sector and onto the
farm sector. Employers groups also want change. "If you really
want to expand domestic demand, the way to do it is not to
raise wages recklessly, but to reduce commodity prices," Bumpei
Otsuki, President of the Japan Federation of Employers'
Associations told a recent press conference.
    External pressures are rising as the U.S. And Europe seek
removal of tariffs and quotas to help reduce their trade
deficits with Japan.
    But vested Japanese interests opposed to change remain well
entrenched, dimming prospects for quick reform, analysts said.
    Although the full-time farm population is falling and there
are signs the LDP is paying more attention to urban
constituencies, the ruling party remains heavily dependent on
farm votes in the rural areas. One rural vote is worth several
city votes due to the pattern of constituency borders.
    The LDP is already in political trouble over its tax reform
plan and does not want to raise another sticky issue so soon,
the analysts said.
    Consumer groups are politically weak and tend to accept the
traditional view that higher prices are a small fee to pay for
national food security, they said.
    Powerful agricultural cooperatives are fiercely opposed to
import liberalisation, but are more flexible about reforms
aimed at stepping up productivity, they said.
    Reform, when it comes, will be in response to specific
pressure rather than an all-embracing program, said Chew.

announce a decision on tough new tariffs on Japanese exports to
retaliate for what he calls Japan's failure to end its unfair
practices in semiconductor trade.
    The 100 pct tariffs are to be imposed on 300 mln dlrs of
Japanese goods recommended for curbs by a special panel of
experts headed by the U.S. Trade Representative's Office.
    Reagan announced last March 27 he would impose the tariffs
on certain goods taken from a list that ranged from computors
and television sets to power tools and photographic film.
    The panel this week winnowed through the list of the some
20 products and sent their recommendations yesterday to Santa
Barbara, where Reagan is vacationing.
    In his March annoucement, Reagan said "I am committed to
full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide
American industry with free and fair trade opportunities."
    He added the tariffs would be lifted once Japan honored the
pact it signed last year to end dumping semiconductors in world
markets and opened its home market to U.S. products.
    U.S. officials said Japan had done nothing since the March
announcement to alter Reagan's plan to invoke the sanctions.
    White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said yesterday:  "we
do not want a trade war, but we feel that this is the kind of
action that requires meaningful action."
    Reagan's move follows steadily rising U.S. trade deicits,
with last year's hitting a record $169.8 billion.
    About one-third of the deficit is in trade with Japan.
    Congress is weighing a trade bill to force the president to
retaliate in certain cases of unfair trade practices.
    He has opposed the legislation, saying it would prevent
negotiated solutions to trade disputes and, in any case, that
existing law was adqeuate to end unfair trade practices.
    Trade experts say his tough action against the Japanese was
as much to penalize the Japanese as to show Congress he did not
need any new trade legislation.
    The Japanese have complained that they have been honoring
the semiconductor pact, but that it would take time before the
results showed up.
    U.S. officials, however, have said their monitoring of
Japanese semiconductor shipments to East Asian countries and
Western Europe showed no letup in the dumping and that the
Japanese home markets remained shut to American exports.
    Japan has said that if Reagan imposed the tariffs, it would
file a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade
(GATT).
    It said hoped GATT would find the U.S. retaliation had

Yeutter said it was all but certain President Reagan would go
ahead today and impose curbs on Japanese exports as planned.
    Asked in a television interview what the chance was for
Reagan to cancel the scheduled 100 pct tariffs on Japanese
electronic exports, he said "slim to none."
    Reagan announced on March 27 he would impose the tariffs to
retaliate for Japan's failure to honor a 1986 agreement to end
dumping computer semiconductors in world markets at less than
cost and to open its home markets to U.S. products.
    Yeutter, on the NBC program "Today," said the United States
did not want to terminate the agreement and would drop
the tariffs once Japan began fulfilling the agreement.
    He said Japanese negotiators last week told U.S. officials
they were honoring the pact, but Yeutter said it would take
time to monitor any compliance.
    Asked how long that would take, he said "We want to see a
pattern of compliance, so in a minimum I would say that would
take a few weeks."
    Yeutter said he did not think there would be much consumer
impact by the tariffs on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods
because the items selected are also readily available from
other countries and manufacturers.
    He said he did not think Japan would retaliate.
    "It seems to me it is not in the interests of either country
to get in an escalating conflict.  The Japanese understand that
full well," Yeutter said.
    He added Japan might challenge the tariffs in the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), but "that's more of a
paper kind of exercise and I don't really expect to see any
adverse impact on U.S. trade."
    Yeutter also said he did not see any way the semiconductor
issue could be resolved before or during a Washington visit
later this month by Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone.
    He said he hoped the visit, which is to have trade as a
major issue, would be productive but "I don't see any practical
way to resolve this particular dispute before or during his
visit."

insurance and freight costs for imported goods of 1.45 billion
dlrs were included in the February trade deficit of 15.1
billion dlrs reported on Tuesday.
    The department is required by law to wait 48 hours after
the initial trade report to issue a second report on a "customs
value" basis, which eliminates the freight and insurance
charges from the cost of imports.
    Private-sector economists emphasized that the Commerce
Department was not revising down the deficit by 1.45 billion
dlrs but simply presenting the figures on a different basis.
    A report in the Washington Post caused a stir in the
foreign exchanges today because it gave the impression, dealers
said, that the underlying trade deficit for February had been
revised downward.
    The Commerce department would like to have the law changed
to permit it to report both sets of figures simultaneously.
    "My feeling is the second one is a better report but there's
legislation that requires us to delay it two days," said Robert
Ortner, Commerce undersecretary for economic affairs.
    "But this has been going on for a long time and no one pays
any attention to the second figure."
    The 15.1 billion dlr February trade deficit compared with a
revised January deficit of 12.3 billion dlrs.
    The law requiring a 48-hour delay in publishing the monthly
trade figure excluding freight and insurance was passed in
1979.
    Reportedly the feeling was the first figure, which includes
customs, freight and insurance, allowed a better comparison
with other countries that reported their trade balances on the
same basis.
    The second figure, which would always be lower by deducting
freight and insurance, presents the deficit in a more favorable
light for the Reagan administration.
    Ortner said he would like to see the law changed to
eliminate the 48-hour delay in reporting the two figures.
    "We're considering it," he said, "It's one of those dinosaur
laws and I think it's time has come."

Reagan imposed on Japanese exports are not only a shot across
Japan's bow but also a sign Reagan will attack unfair trade
practices worldwide, U.S. officials said.
    But Robert Crandall, a trade specialist at Brookings
Institution, a think tank, said "a shot across their bow can
often result in a shot in our stern."
    He said it left the United States open to retaliation.
    The U.S. officials said the 100 pct tariffs Reagan ordered
on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods will also show Congress
that a tough pro-trade stand can be taken under existing laws,
and no new protectionist legislation is needed.
    In the past year tough trade action had been taken against
the European Community over corn and sorghum, Taiwan over beer
and wine, South Korea over counterfeiting of copyrights,
patents and trademarkets and Japan on tobacco.
    White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters the
tariffs - up from five pct - should be seen as a "serious signal"
to other nations on the need for fair trade practices.
    Reagan said he imposed the sanctions on certain computers,
television sets and some hand tools because Japan did not honor
an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at
less than cost and to open its markets to U.S. products. The
tariffs were placed on items which were available from other
sources so there would be little effect on the American
consumer, Fitzwater said.
    Reagan has come under heavy pressure to take tougher action
- especially against Japan - to end global unfair trade
practices and reverse the growing U.S. trade deficit.
    The alternative was that if he did not, Congress would.
    The U.S. trade gap last year was a record 169.8 billion
dlrs, and continues to rise, with Japan accounting for about
one-third of America's overall deficit.
    But there are other two-way deficits - with Canada, West
Germany, Taiwan and South Korea - and Reagan officials said the
president is ready to fight them all.
    Reagan said in announcing the sanctions today that "I regret
that these actions are necessary," but that the health and
vitality of the U.S. semiconductor industry was essential to
American competitiveness in world markets.
    "We cannot allow it to be jeopardized by unfair trading
practices," Reagan added in the statement from his California
vacation home at Santa Barbara.
    He said the tariffs would remain in force until Japan
abided by the agreement.
    U.S. officials say the action today will show Congress -
which is about to write a trade bill he does not like - that he
already has the tools needed to fight unfair trade.
    The White House aide said of the tariff action, "it wasn't
done to appease Congress, but because there was an unfair trade
practice."
    The aide added, however, "on another plane, it was an
example of how the administration uses the trade law to fight
unfair practices, an that it is not necessary to make a major
overall of our trade laws."
    But the analyst, Crandall, said the tariff action was not
in the best interests of the United States, and that
negotiations should have been pursued to resolve the issue.
    "It's very dangerous to go down the retaliatory route," he
said, "because it leads to more retaliation and restrictions in
trade."
    Crandall said, "the administration is doing this for its
political impact across the country, and therefore its impact
on Congress."
    He said, "I don't think it makes a lot of sense."
    But other analysts said it made little difference whether
the tariffs were aimed at U.S. trading partners or Congress,
and that the main point was that the trading partners were on
notice that retaliation was a weapon Reagan was ready to use.
    Spokesman Fitzwater said "we don't want a trade war," but the
imposition of sanctions showed the United States would act when
it had evidence that trade pacts were being violated.

praised South Korea's new surplus-cutting trade policies but
warned of possible protectionist retaliation if Seoul's market
liberalisation efforts falter or fail.
    In a press conference after talks with South Korean
leaders, Baldrige called the government's announced intention
to regulate exports and boost imports "a very, very important
step, the right direction for the Korean government to take."
    The government adopted the new policies last week in the
hope of heading off a trade war with the U.S.
    Baldrige said the policies "showed an understanding of the
fact that this country cannot go on indefinitely growing by
exports alone."
    "There has to be enough of a change so that domestic growth
begins to take more of the load," he said.
    South Korea had a 7.2 billion dlr trade surplus with
Washington in 1986, thanks largely to booming sales of cars and
consumer electronic goods. It racked up another 1.4 billion
dlrs in surplus in the first quarter of this year.
    Baldrige said Seoul's package of measures was "broad enough
and comprehensive enough so that ... Actions can be taken for
liberalising imports (and) increasing the domestic economy, if
the government is willing to follow through."
    "We will be watching the implementation of this new policy
direction very closely," he said. "Because of the protectionism
growing in the U.S., We see a real problem if Korea does not
keep on the same path ... Of steadily increasing
liberalisation.... If that should falter or fail or turn
backward, I'm as sure as I'm standing here that we'd see
protectionist movement in the U.S."
    Baldrige said he and South Korean Trade Minister Rha
Woong-bae spent much time discussing trade problems in specific
product categories.
    These included service industries, which he said were still
too much of a closed sector in South Korea, and computers and
cars. Baldrige said he urged speedy action on removing the
tariffs and taxes on imported U.S. Cars which can make them
sell for up to three times their American prices.
    "We want to stop that. With this sort of thing, there's
going to be trouble somewhere down the road," he said. "We are
just pointing this out."
    Asked if Seoul's measures could succeed without a
revaluation of the won, which Washington has been urging for
months, Baldrige declined to comment. "We don't have any target
for any particular currency, but we do feel that currencies
around the world, if we are going to be successful as a world
economy, have to reflect the fundamentals of the various
economies involved," he said.
    Baldrige said he had agreed to Rha's proposal for
cooperation on forming U.S.-South Korean joint ventures in
third countries. The American government would be pleased to
encourage U.S. Firms to get involved, he added.
    Commenting on President Reagan's decision to increase
tariffs on certain Japanese imports to the U.S., Baldrige said
Washington's trade problems with Japan were not comparable to
its difficulties with South Korea.
    "I think the attitude in Korea is both reasonable and fair,"
he said. "It's a firm attitude. We don't get anything for
nothing or just by asking for it.
    "But our negotiations are friendly and reasonable and they
usually end up with something good happening at the end that
both countries live up to."

Howe called on industrial and developing countries to combat
trade protectionism and remove barriers which impede free
trading in agricultural products.
    Howe said in an address to the annual meeting of the U.N.
Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP)
that success in fighting protectionism hinges on the current
Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
    He said Britain is committed to resisting and combatting
protectionism because free trade is vital to Britain where 30
pct of the gnp comes from trade in goods and services.
    Howe urged developing countries to open up their markets,
remove measures distorting free trade in services and provide
protection for intellectual property rights.
    He said industrial nations should also adopt macro-economic
policies which help reduce trade imbalances and promote stable
currency relationships.
    Howe said the agricultural industry, plagued by surpluses
and falling commodity prices in recent years, is over
subsidised and over protected. But the problem of farm
surpluses must be tackled despite the fact that it is
politically difficult for any government to reverse the trend
of growing farm subsidies.
    "This problem of over-subsidisation and over-protection of
agriculture will dog us in the years ahead and it will need the
sustained application of all our energy and our imagination to
find solutions," Howe said.

an ambitious proposal calling for a one billion U.S. Dollar
investment by private and public companies in the United States
over the next five years, ministry officials said.
    John Ni, director of the Ministry's Industrial Development
and Investment Centre (IDIC), said under the IDIC proposal,
Taiwanese firms would be encouraged to set up factories and
invest in property and securities markets in the U.S..
    Taiwan's 1986 investment in the U.S. Totalled 46 mln U.S.
Dlrs, official statistics show.
    The investment was mainly in the electronics, food, service
and trading sectors.
    The new proposal, approved by Economic Minister Lee Ta-hai
yesterday, calls for investment of 80 mln U.S. Dlrs in 1987,
120 mln in 1988, 160 mln in 1989, 240 mln in 1990 and 400 mln
in 1991, he told Reuters.
    It will be discussed soon by officials of the Finance
Ministry, the Central Bank and the Council for Economic
Planning and Development before being submitted to the cabinet
for final approval, he said.
    "This is the first ambitious proposal with government
initiatives to encourage our businessmen to invest in America,"
Lee said.
    He said government incentives to prospective Taiwanese
investors would include bank loans and a five-year income tax
holiday. Applications for investing in the U.S. Would also be
simplified.
    A ministry spokesman told reporters the proposed investment
would be helpful in creating job opportunities for Americans
and avoiding U.S. Import quotas or restrictions on Taiwanese
products.
    The plan will also help reduce Taiwan's trade surplus with
the U.S., Which rose to a record 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs in
1986, up from 10.2 billion in 1985, the spokesman said.
    The rising surplus has enabled Taiwan to accumulate some 54
billion U.S. Dlrs in foreign exchange reserves.
    Economists described the proposal as a significant step by
the government to head off U.S. Protectionism.
    "Time is running out for us. Taiwan has lagged far behind
Japan and South Korea in encouraging its businessmen to invest
abroad," said Hou Chia-chi, economics professor at Soochow

    The official Peking Review yesterday accused the United

over its huge trade surplus and recognizes that it must act
more quickly to refocus its export driven economy, a senior
Foreign Ministry official said.
    "The sense of crisis among the Japanese public as well as
the government is increasing," Deputy Director General Hiroshi
Hirabayashi told reporters. "The need to accelerate the efforts
(to restructure the economy) is well recognized."
    Hirabayashi said that gradual progress had been made to
refocus the Japanese economy, but admitted that it might not
seem all that spectacular to foreign observers.
    Difficulties had been encountered in implementing the
so-called Maekawa report since it was unveiled a year ago, he
said. But, he added, foreign governments should appreciate the
efforts that have been made.
    The report, named for its principal author, former Bank of
Japan governor Haruo Maekawa, called for a shift in Japan's
economy away from its dependence on exports for growth. The
Japanese cabinet today reviewed progress made since its
release.
    According to Hirabayashi, Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone
told his fellow ministers that Japan must follow the direction
set out by Maekawa and urged them to make efforts to achieve
it.
    Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari added that not enough had
been done to publicize the action Japan was taking to refocus
its economy.
    Listing some of those actions, Hirabayashi said imports of
manufactured goods have increased, interest rates have fallen,
and coal, steel and non-ferrous metal output have been reduced.
    He expressed hope that Japan will act more quickly in the
future to implement the report and scoffed at a suggestion that
it would take ten years for Maekawa's goals to be met.
    "It will not take very much time to fulfill the (goals) set
out by the Maekawa report," he said.

 ]]></BODY><BODY><![CDATA[Congress returned from its Easter
recess ready for the annual Spring budget battle that promises
to be a partisan dispute.
    The budget fight pitting Democrats against President Reagan
and Republicans is expected to get underway this week in the
Senate late this week and last at least another week. It is
taking on new prominence because of current trade woes.
    That is because the budget problems and its associated huge
deficits are said to be at the root of related international
trade friction currently worrying financiers.
    As the dollar slides downward on global markets and stock
exchanges gyrate wildly, the trade dispute involving the United
States and Japan once again is spreading fears of a major trade
war between the two trading giants for the first time since
World War II.
    Ostensibly that dispute is over U.S. charges that Japan is
refusing to open its markets to semi-conductor chips and the
resulting U.S. tariffs doubling prices of Japanese televisions
and small computers.
    Behind the elements of a brewing trade war which neither
side wants, is the dilemma of the U.S. budget and its deficit.
    Some analysts say the financial markets may be waking up to
the economic realities that the huge debt cannot continue to
grow without repercussions.
    A large portion of the U.S. debt has been financed by
foreigners from their accumulated trade surpluses. But if they
withdraw this support the result can only be further problems,
including higher interest rates for Americans.
    In a nutshell, the U.S. budget process has now moved to the
showdown stages in Congress. Reagan's own trillion dollar
spending budget for the government year 1988, starting Oct. 1,
was trounced badly in the House on April 9.
    The Senate takes up a plan similar to one that passed the
House, calling for slashing the deficit from its estimated 171
billion dlr level next year to about 134 billion dlrs, through
defense and domestic spending cuts and about 18.5 billion dlrs
in new, unspecified, taxes. As the Senate prepares to take up
its own budget plan, majority Democrats predict there will be
passage of a bill, only after a protracted partisan battle.
    In the House, not one Republican voted for the budget,
which passed by 230 to 192. In the Senate, none of Reagan's
Republicans voted for the budget as it passed out of the Senate
Budget Committee for full Senate consideration.
    A key Senate Budget Committee source told Reuters he
believes this very unusual unanimous opposition was by design
among congressional Republicans, perhaps with the tacit
approval of the White House.
    "Republicans want Democrats to take the heat for any tax
hikes and defense cuts," he said.
    In the coming weeks, the source said, Democrats will press
for a bipartisan budget and seek a negotiated budget with
Reagan -- who already is opposed to the idea. But "it is not
clear how the Republicans will act," he added.
    He said Republicans may propose their own plan for lower
taxes and more defense spending, which they did not offer after
Reagan's budget was clobbered in an early vote in the House.
     When Reagan entered the White House in 1981, he inherited
what was labelled a huge deficit from Jimmy Carter that wound
up to be nearly 79 billion dlrs that year.
    Despite Reagan's promise to balance the budget by 1983,
critics note that his administration's record of accumulated
debt is estimated over one trillion dlrs, or 1,100 billion
dlrs.
    That is money the government must borrow, and pay back, and
many analysts say it is what kept the dollar high and caused
the worst U.S. trade deficit ever.
     Last year the United States bought goods from the world
worth 169.8 billion dlrs more than what it sold, including
purchases of 58.6 billion dlrs in Japanese goods.
    While Congress is trying to attack the trade deficit on one
front through a get-tough trade bill promising retaliatory
measures unless all markets are opened, its success so far
against the budget deficit has been marked by limited progress.
    Congress, which controls the pursestrings, has put the
deficit on a downward path from its record high of 220.7
billion dlrs accumulated in fiscal 1986, which ended Sept. 30.
    Because of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings balanced budget law
enacted in late 1985, there has been pressure on Congress to do
more than talk about deficits.
    That law, named after Republican Senators Phil Gramm of
Texas, Warren Rudman of New Hampshire and Democrat Ernest
Hollings of South Carolina, calls for a balanced budget by 1991
through a series of set deficit targets that Congress must meet.
    The law has been followed, even though an enforcement
mechanism to mandate automatic across-the-board cuts if
Congress misses its goal was stricken by the Supreme Court.
    The legislators have followed the targets -- on paper. But
in reality, the goal has actually been missed. For example,
Congress last year approved legislation to meet the 1987 target
of a 144 billion dlr deficit. But even after approving the
numbers, the deficit for 1987 is estimated at over 170 billion
dlrs -- far off the target.
    This year the target is 108 billion dlrs and that goal is
expected to be missed widely.

extended their textile export agreement after negotiations in
Washington this week, a spokesman for the Taiwan Textile
Federation said.
    Charles Chen told Reuters the original three year accord
has been extended by one year to the end of 1989. The U.S. Has
agreed to raise the limit on annual growth of Taiwan's textile
and apparel exports to one pct from 0.5 pct for calendar 1989,
he said. "The new accord is more fair and gives breathing space
to our textile makers (so they can) diversify their exports to
other nations," he added.
    Chen said the revised agreement puts Taiwan on similar
textile exporting terms to Hong Kong and South Korea. But
despite the changes, Taiwanese firms have lost orders to rivals
in Hong Kong and South Korea because of the strong Taiwan
dollar, he said. The Taiwan currency has risen 17 pct against
the U.S. Dollar since September 1985 while the Korean won rose
by some six pct and the Hong Kong dollar was stable.
    Taiwan's textile exports to the U.S. Amounted to 2.8
billion U.S. Dlrs last year out of total exports to the U.S. Of
7.8 billion. Textile exports are expected to remain the same
this year, Chen said.

(LDP) drew up a final plan to expand domestic demand and boost
imports in time for Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's visit to
Washington next week, LDP officials said.
    The plan calls for additional fiscal measures worth more
than 5,000 billion yen, a large-scale supplementary budget for
the current fiscal year started April 1, and concentration of
more than 80 pct of the annual public works budget in the first
half of the year, they said.
    Nakasone will explain the measures to U.S. Officials during
his visit to Washington starting April 29.

    The LDP plan will be the basis for a government package of
pump-priming measures expected to be unveiled in late May.
    The LDP said Japan should do more to reduce its trade
surplus. Its plan is expected to help increase economic growth
led by domestic demand, officials said.
    The government was also urged to review the ceiling on
budgetary requests for investment purposes in 1988/89. The
government has imposed a five pct cut in investment outlays in
the past five years in line with Nakasone's avowed policy of
fiscal reforms.

    The plan called on Japan to promote government purchases of
foreign goods and private sector imports of manufactured goods
by improving import financing, and to make clear official
procurement procedures for foreign supercomputers.
    The LDP also said Japan should contribute further to
society at large through measures such as doubling its official
development assistance to 7.6 billion dlrs in five years or so
instead of seven years as the government had originally
promised.
    The government was urged to work out a program to recycle
funds from Japan's trade surpluses to debt-ridden countries.

    The officials said the funds to be recycled would include
those from the private sector and others provided through the
government Export-Import Bank of Japan and Japan's Overseas
Economic Cooperation Fund.
    The plan also calls for the government to take steps to
help the development of African and other less developed
nations.
    The LDP called for adequate and flexible management of
monetary policy, such as a cut in interest rates on deposits
with the Finance Ministry's Trust Fund, and a tax cut to
promote plant and equipment investment.

Japanese envoy has done little to defuse Japan's trade
frictions with the United States, U.S. and congressional
leaders say.
    White House and congressional leaders took a wait-and-see
stance, after a series of meetings with former Japanese Foreign
Minister Shintaro Abe, who was here paving the way for the
April 29-May 2 visit of Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone.

    They are withholding judgment until Nakasone's visit, with
one senator saying Japan had promised to stimulate its economy
and open its markets to foreign goods in the past, but it was
time now for action.
    The U.S. trade deficit last year was a record 169.8 billion
dlrs, with more than one-third of it in trade with Japan.
    Congress is ready to approve tough trade legislation to try
to turn around the deficit, which has cost millions of U.S.
jobs and closed thousands of factories.
    Much of the anger has been directed at Japan.
    U.S.-Japan trade friction was further fueled by President
Reagan's April 17 decision to impose 100 pct tariffs on 300 mln
dlrs worth of Japanese goods in retaliation for unfair
practices in semiconductor trade.
    Reagan said he imposed the tariffs on personal computers,
television sets and hand tools because Japan failed to keep an
agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at
less than cost and to open its home market to U.S. products.
 
    Abe had asked Reagan to end the tariffs quickly, but U.S.
officials said the curbs would not be dropped until Japan had
shown it was honoring the pact, which could take several
months.
    White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, asked if Nakasone's
visit might help to defuse trade tensions, said "whether
progress can be made depends on how you want to measure it."
    He added, "I would expect progress to be made. If you want
to measure that in terms of lifting the sanctions, that's more
doubtful."
    Congressmen were equally skeptical.
    Abe met Senate and Democratic leaders active in trade
legislation, telling them of Japan's plan to spur domestic
spending by 34 billion dlrs and open its markets to a wide
range of goods, including supercomputers and farm products.
    Sen. John Danforth, a Missouri Republican, said after the
meeting, "We have heard promises in the past, but the question
now is whether there will be real action."
    Abe also met House leaders pressing for a tough trade bill,
including Congressman Richard Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat.
    Gephardt is sponsoring legislation to penalize nations with
large deficits and which are guilty of unfair trade practices.
    Gephardt's legislation would hit Japan, as well as Taiwan,
South Korea, and West Germany. The bill is expected to pass the
House next week - coinciding with Nakasone's visit - but its
fate in the more moderate Senate is uncertain. A bipartisan
group of senators, however, told Nakasone in a letter released
as Abe was holding Senate meetings, that fresh Japanese-U.S.
trade strife would erupt if Japan's markets were not soon
opened to American goods.
    The signers included Democratic leader Robert Byrd of West
Virginia, Republican leader Robert Dole of Kansas and others
ranging from moderate to hardline on trade issues.
    They said in the letter there was growing U.S. sentiment
that Japan was fighting opening its markets and "evidence to the
contrary is necessary to combat this perception, or it is
likley that additional efforts will be attempted to close off
the American market to Japanese goods.

    In a news conference, the director of the bank's Foreign
Trade Department (Cacex), Roberto Fendt, attributed March's 
weak performance to labour strikes.
    March exports totalled 1.43 billion dlrs, against 1.53
billion dlrs in February, and 2.16 billion dlrs in March 1986.
    March imports amounted to 1.29 billion dlrs compared to
1.27 billion dlrs in February and 1.02 billion dlrs in March
1986.
    Fendt said coffee earnings were up to 220 mln dlrs in March
from 110 mln dlrs in February, while oil derivatives were down
to 54 mln dlrs from 58 mln dlrs in February.
    He said that although the March results were considerably
lower than the same month last year, the government's target of
an eight billion dlr surplus for 1987 should be achieved. The
January-March trade surplus totalled 526 mln dlrs, below the
same period last year, which reached 2.46 billion dlrs.
    Asked to explain the reason for his optimism, Fendt said
the trade surplus should reach one billion dlrs in each of the
last six months of the year.
    Even though results in the exports of steel, shoes and
frozen concentrated orange juice were weaker compared to
February, Fendt said this was not an indication that the United
States was retaliating on account of its dispute with Brazil in
the issue of informatics.
    For the next three months, Fendt estimated a monthly trade
surplus of 400 mln dlrs, for an overall surplus of 1.2 billion

Congress in his weekly radio address against passing what he
called dangerous, protectionist trade legislation that would
tie his hands in trade negotiations with Japan and other
countries.
    Reagan, who will hold talks with Japanese Prime Minister
Yasuhiro Nakasone here this week, said he would lift tariffs
imposed last week against some Japanese products as soon as
Tokyo complied with a U.S.-Japanese pact on semiconductors.
    U.S. Officials gave the same message to former Japanese
Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe in meetings in Washington last
week.
    In his weekly radio address on Saturday, Reagan said he
would tell Nakasone: "We want to continue to work cooperatively
on trade problems and want very much to lift these trade
restrictions as soon as evidence permits.
    Reagan said the 100 pct tariffs he imposed on some 300 mln
dlrs worth of Japanese goods was a special case of trade
retaliation and did not signal a shift in what he called his
staunch anti-protectionist policies.
    "In imposing these tariffs we were just trying to deal with
a particular problem, not begin a trade war," he said.
    But Congress is ready to approve tough trade legislation to
try to turn round the record U.S. Trade deficit, which has cost
millions of U.S. Jobs and closed thousands of factories.
    A vote on a trade bill sponsored by Congressman Richard
Gephardt is expected to come during Nakasone"s visit. It would
penalise nations with large trade surpluses and which are
alleged to use unfair trade practices.
    Reagan warned Congress that such action would undercut his
ability to negotiate on trade issues with Nakasone and others.
    "With my meeting with Prime Minister Nakasone and the Venice
economic summit coming up, it"s terribly important not to
restrict a president"s options in such trade dealings with
foreign governments," he said.
    "Unfortunately, some in the Congress are trying to do
exactly that," he said.
    Reagan said he would keep the American people "informed on
this dangerous legislation because it"s just another form of
protectionism and I may need your help to stop it."

punitive tariffs of 300 mln dlrs a year on Japanese electronic

    Japan also faces more possible sanctions amid calls in the
U.S. Congress for further action to help improve trade
imbalances.
    Japan's trade surplus with the United States reached a
record 58.6 billion dlrs in 1986.
    Nakasone told reporters that special envoy Shintaro Abe,
who has just returned from Washington, told him protectionist
sentiment in the United States is severe.
    "We are well aware of a movement in the United States to
enact legislation," Nakasone said.
    He said friends at home and abroad have advised him not to
go to the United States but it is now more important than ever
that he express Japan's view and carefully listens to the views
of the United States.
    "My visit to the United States at this time will be the most
important visit of all," Nakasone said.
    While in Washington, he said he hopes to have candid and
frank discussions with President Reagan and Congressionl

economic cooperation to developing countries and U.S.-Soviet
disarmament and arms control.
    On the recently imposed trade sactions, Nakasone said he
would present evidence that Japanese semiconductor imports are
increasing and that Japan is monitoring exports to third
countries.
    "We have full confidence we can present clear evidence," he
said. "(Therefore), we will request that the sanctions be lifted
at the earliest possible time."
    On the trade imbalance, Nakasone said Japan has already
taken action. The volume of exports to the United States has
been cut, while U.S. Imports have increased.
    But Japanese imports from Europe and other Asian nations
have recently surged, those from the United States remain weak,
indicating a lack of U.S. Competitiveness, he said.
    Nakasone said Japan will continue to strive to improve the
trade imbalance but the United States will have to become more
competitive and improve its huge budget deficit.
    He said he will also discuss the forthcoming Venice summit
of the seven major industrial nations in June.
    "We can further enhance the efforts for improving peace,
disarmament and the world economies as a whole through
solidarity," Nakasone said.

beleaguered by political turmoil at home, sets out Wednesday on
a tough mission to Washington aimed at defusing the most
serious U.S.-Japanese trade tension in recent memory.
    Two rounds of talks between President Reagan and Nakasone,
scheduled for Thursday and Friday, come on the heels of the
imposition by the United States of punitive tariffs on Japanese
goods for the first time since World War Two.
    In the past, bilateral trade friction involving cotton
goods, steel, television sets, textiles and cars have ended
with Japan taking on voluntary export curbs.
    Nakasone's visit could coincide with the passage of a
protectionist trade bill by the U.S. House of Representatives.
    A proposed amendment to the bill, drafted by Representative
Richard Gephardt of Missouri, will mandate a 10 pct annual
reduction in the trade surpluses of Japan and other nations
which have large trade gaps with the United States.
    The United States last year had a record trade deficit of
169.8 billion dlrs and Japan accounted for about one-third.
    Foreign Ministry spokesman Yoshifumi Matsuda said recently
he was reasonably optimistic about the results of talks between
the two leaders.
    Top U.S. and Japanese officials have shuttled back and
forth across the Pacific to lay the groundwork for Nakasone's
visit. The last of the talks leading up to the main event will
be in Washington next Wednesday between U.S. Secretary of State
George Shultz and Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari.
    Nakasone will have an economic package worked out by the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and by an advisory body
led by former Bank of Japan Governor Haruo Maekawa.
    Japan plans to spend over 5,000 billion yen to boost
domestic demand, increase imports of U.S. products including
supercomputers and give more help to developing countries,
government officials said.
    The government has been making last ditch efforts in time
for Nakasone's trip to address outstanding bilateral issues,
officials said.
    The issues include foreign access to a new Japanese
overseas telecommunications venture and a six billion dlr
international airport project in western Japan.
    Nakasone and his party last week reached a compromise
accord with opposition parties over a controversial sales tax
plan in exchange for parliamentary passage by the Lower House
of a government draft budget for 1987/88.
    The accord, offered by House Speaker Kenzaburo Hara,
virtually killed the Nakasone-sponsored plan, but left room for
future tax reform plans, political analysts said.
    Nakasone, who led his party to a resounding electoral
triumph last July, saw his popularity drop because of the sales
tax.
    His party suffered setbacks in an Upper House by-election
and nationwide local elections in the past two months.
    Mitsuru Uchida, professor of political science at Waseda
University, told Reuters: "I doubt that whatever Nakasone does
in Washington -- no matter how good it might be -- would help
restore his weakened power-base at home."
    Many analysts said Nakasone might step down after the
Venice summit of industrialized nations in June.

United States could lift trade sanctions against Japan soon.
    But he said the United States would do what is necessary to
see that other nations lived up to their trade agreements.
    In a speech prepared for delivery to the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, he said, "I hope that, before long, we can lift these
(Japanese trade sanctions) and that this episode will be
recorded as a small incident in the building of our
relationship."
    But, Reagan added, "we will do what is necessary to see that
other nations live up to their obligations and trading
agreements with us. Trade must be free. It must also be fair."
    Reagan said the decision to impose 100 pct tariffs on 300
mln dlrs worth of electronic exports to the United States sent
a message it was time to complete a U.S.-Japan "trade bridge."
  "The final answer to the trade problems between America and
Japan is not more hemming and hawing, not more trade sanctions,
not more voluntary restraint agreements - though these may be
needed as steps along the way - and certainly not more
unfulfilled agreements," he said.
    Reagan said the answer was genuinely fair and open markets
on both sides of the Pacific - "and the sooner, the better."
    Reagan said the administration's tools for dealing with
unfair trade practices met the need for both firmness and
finesse.
    He said trade legislation pending in Congress would be
dangerous because it would force the administration to use "a
steamroller against unfair practices every time, no matter
whether the steamroller would open the trade doors or flatten
the entire house," he said.
    Reagan said that ending every unfair trade practice in
Japan would cut the U.S. trade deficit by only about 10 pct.
    "If our trade deficit is to come down, more must be done --
and is being done," he said.
    "The change in the dollar's value is part of it, and since
the middle of last year, the actual volume of our exports had
been on the rise," he said.
    He also said he believed America's trading partners should
cut taxes and regulations, as the United States had done, so
that they could create jobs and buy more goods.

    The tariff cuts, of between five and 30 percentage points,
take effect on July 1.
    This brings to 157 the number of goods on which import
taxes have been cut this year, a ministry official said.
    The 157 are among about 290 items on which Washington has
asked Seoul to lower tariffs, he added.
    Today's announcement follows Saturday's removal of import
curbs on 170 products. For 46 of those products, the U.S. Had

the surplus was expected to widen further in 1987 but Seoul
would try to hold it below eight billion dlrs.
    The finance ministry said tariffs would be cut later this

ethylene, by an average 7.7 percentage points in order to check
inflation.
    The officials said the tariff cuts would contribute to

reduce the flow of foreign goods into the United States will do
little to cut the nation's swelling trade deficit, a government
study said.
    In fact, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) report said,
such protectionist policies could make U.S. Products less
competitive in the world marketplace by raising the cost of
imported products that are re-exported in different forms.
    "Such policies are much more likely to hurt, rather than
help, the productive capabilities of the U.S. Economy," it said.
    The 218-page report, written by FTC economists John Hilke
and Philip Nelson, blamed the rising trade shortfall, which
climbed to a record 166.3 billion dlrs last year, on shifting
currency exchange rates and growing U.S consumer demand.
    Other factors commonly blamed for the deficit, such as
foreign trade practices, deteriorating U.S. Industrial
competitiveness, high labour costs and government restrictions
on mergers, added little to the problem, it said.
    "Although each industry's competitiveness affects the level
of imports and exports in that industry, in general we find
that there have been no significant industry-specific changes
affecting competitiveness that would explain the increase in
the overall trade deficit," the study said.
    "To the extent any government action is needed to deal with
the trade deficits, policies should focus on economy-wide
phenomena such as exchange rates and relative economic growth,"
the FTC study said.
    Supporting its conclusion that broad-based economic shifts
were the cause of the increase in the trade deficit, the report
said it found that nearly all U.S. Industries lost some
domestic market share to foreign competitors in the 1980s.
    It also said it found a "fairly direct relationship" between
the increased trade deficit and the influence of shifting
currency exchange rates, U.S. Economic growth and domestic
demand for goods and services, which has outpaced foreign
consumer demand.
    The study examined seven factors which have been commonly
blamed for the trade deficit: foreign government subsidies and
trade barriers to protect foreign industries, a lack of
investment in U.S. Industry, declining research and development
in U.S. Industry, high labour costs, union work rules, the oil
prices rises of the 1970s and U.S. Antitrust regulations.
    In each case, the study found little or no evidence that
the factor had any impact on the trade deficit.

review of Japanese semiconductor trading practices but has not
yet decided whether trade sanctions levied against Japan last
April should be lifted, U.S. officials said.
    They said the president's Economic Policy Council looked at
Japan's adherence to the 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact
yesterday and that an announcement may be made shortly.
    But there was no hint what the announcement might be.
    Officials have said the 100 pct tariffs on 300 mln dlrs of
Japanese exports could be modified if Japan was found to be
honoring a portion of its semiconductor pact.
    But they also noted that the White House has said it was
unlikely the tariffs would be lifted before the meeting of the
world's seven major economic powers in Venice on June 8-10.
    The officials added that while the curbs complicated
U.S.-Japanese economic cooperation, they did serve to blunt 
Congressional criticism that the Reagan Administrtation was not
taking tough actions to reduce he U.S. trade deficit.
    Reagan imposed the sanctions on April 17 in retaliation for
Japan's failure to honor commitments to end dumping
semiconductors in world markets at less than production costs
and to open its own market to U.S. goods.
    The sanctions were levied on certain Japanese television
sets, personal computers and hand-held power tools.
    Reagan, in imposing the curbs, said they would be lifted as
soon as there was evidence of a pattern that Japan was adhering

the 6,000 billion yen economic package announced by Tokyo last
week went further than the U.S. Had expected.
    But he said the U.S. Would not lift the selective economic
sanctions it imposed on Japanese imports in April until Tokyo
changed its sales policies concerning computer microchips.
    Speaking in a televised news conference linking several
European capitals, Shultz said it was heartening that the
Japanese had confronted the problem of stimulating domestic and
global demand.

    "There is an even greater amount of stimulus than was
originally thought," said Shultz, speaking from Washington.
    "It is a lot more than nothing. It is more than was talked
about when (Prime Minister Yasuhiro) Nakasone was here.
    "It involves a major reduction in tax rates and we believe
that getting the tax burden down is one way of stimulating the
economy," he added.
    But asked by Japanese reporters, also linked into the news
conference, whether the positive reaction meant the U.S. Might
decide at next week's Venice summit to lift its sanctions on
some Japanese electronic goods, Shultz replied:
    "These sanctions were undertaken on the basis of an
agreement that had been reached between the United States and
Japan on various sale practices and prices relating to the chip
market.
    "They will be lifted as the facts of change by Japan to the
agreement that it made become evident."
    He said U.S. Officials had only been able to monitor the
situation for a month and that it was impossible to determine a
trend on only one month's data.
    The U.S. Imposed 100 pct import duties on personal
computers, colour televisions and power tools, alleging that
Japan had violated last September's bilateral agreement by
selling computer chips at below fair market value.
    Shultz said West Germany and other nations would also do
well to look at what they could do to stimulate demand.
    Asked whether the U.S. Could reasonably ask its allies to
take action to stimulate the world economy without a bold
American initiative to reduce the size of the federal budget
deficit, Shultz said moves were already underway to tackle the
problem.
    He said by the end of the current fiscal year the deficit
would probably be reduced by around 35 billion dlrs against
last year, and that the budget being worked on this year would
contain a major reduction.

protection, the U.S. textile industry could become competitive
with the most modern foreign producers, analysts from two
congressional agencies said today.
    The Office of Technology Assessment, a nonpartisan arm of
Congress told a House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee hearing
there was still concern for the future of parts of the U.S.
textile and apparel industry, but there was more reason for
optimism than a few years ago.
    "While textile producers are making significant
investments, they could do more," OTA analyst Henry Kelly said.
    The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the nonpartisan
budget analysis arm of Congress, said federal loans or loan
guarantees would be preferable options for Congress rather than
increased trade protection which could lead to foreign
retaliation.
    CBO analyst Edward Gramlich said past trade protections,
first imposed in the 1950's have had only a small benefit for
profits and investments of domestic firms.
    Trade Subcommittee chairman, Rep. Sam Gibbons, said the
agencies analyses seemed to agree with his opinion against
congressional approval of protectionist textile quota
legislation aimed mainly at Western Europe, Japan and other
Asian textile producing countries.
    President Reagan last year vetoed a textile protection bill
but it was reintroduced in this session of Congress and is
expected to be voted on in the House this year.
    However, approval this year is in doubt because passage of
a major trade bill without specific protections for textiles
showed a weakening of support for the legislation.
    Most U.S. producers have fallen behind other foreign
producers in the use of modern textile and apparel production
equipment and net imports are growing faster than the domestic
markets, Kelly said.
    He added that private investment in the textile and
clothing industry in 1983 of 0.5 pct was less than one-seventh
the average manufacturing investment of 3.9 pct.
    Despite existing import quotas and tariffs, imports of
textiles grew 26 pct in 1986 and imports of apparel grew 14 pct
while U.S. production rose only 1.9 pct.
    "The traditional industry seems destined to be replaced by
new technology, imports, or some combination of both. While the
industry may not be able to compete in all domestic markets
that it enjoyed twenty years ago, the results of our research
indicate that portions of the domestic market can be recovered,
and that exports can be expanded," Kelly said.

representative in Washington, warned the United States against
setting a rule that trading partners running a surplus should
be "beaten over the head" for not removing trade barriers.
    Denman, in an Op-Ed piece in today's Washington Post, said
trade disputes should be dealt with through negotiations,
either bilaterally or multilaterally, through the Geneva-based
United Nations agency, General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,
GATT.
    Denman's comments came as the Senate was to begin debate
this week on a major trade bill.
    "It is dangerous to establish a rule that trading partners
running a surplus with the United States should be beaten over
the head if trade barriers objected to by the United States are
not removed within a certain time-scale," said Denman in an
apparent reference to some of the measures in the congressional
trade bill.
    "If we turn to the path of unilateral action, retaliation
and counter-retaliation, the one-world (GATT) trading system
will very quickly unravel," he said.
    Denman said the 170 billion dlr U.S. trade deficit was not
purely the result of unfair trade practices by foreign nations.
    "The trade deficit results from a combination of
macroeconomic factors (the U.S. budget deficit), the exchange
rate and the competitiveness of (U.S.) domestic industry,"
Denman said.
    He also said that Washington employed what he termed unfair
trade prctices.
    He said the European Community had recently updated a list
of some 30 U.S. trade barriers that impede EC exports.

aggressive intent. We did so to set the record straight," Denman

United States of violating a political commitment to free trade
through practices including a tax on imported gasoline and a
customs user fee.
    EC ambassador Tran Van-Thinh made the formal charge to the
surveillance body of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT), GATT spokesman David Woods told reporters.
    Woods also said the EC was joined by the United States in
criticising Brazil for extending its list of products for which
import licenses have been temporarily suspended, so as to
improve its balance of payments.
    The United States charged Japan with violating GATT rules
by restricting imports of agricultural products through an
import licensing system. The United States asked for
consultations with Tokyo on the issue.
    Tran charged that the trade measures contravened a
political commitment to halt and reverse trade barriers,
pledged by ministers in Punta del Este last September.
    When ministers established the four year Uruguay round to
negotiate freer trade in 13 areas, they set up the GATT
surveillance body to monitor this commitment, known in GATT
jargon as "standstill and rollback."
    Tran criticised Washington for the "superfund" tax on oil
imports, a customs user fee, and the removal of a special
machine tool (known as category FSC34) from its government
procurement list for reasons of national security.
    Warren Lavorel, a U.S. Trade official, defended the
policies, saying they did not violate GATT trade rules.
    The surveillance body will send a record of today's talks
to the Trade Negotiating Committee, which oversees the round,
to decide any further action on the charges.
    The oil tax and customs user fee have already been the
subject of formal GATT dispute panels set up outside the
Uruguay Round to rule on the legality of the practices.
    The ruling GATT Council yesterday adopted a dispute panel's
report and ruled that the U.S. Superfund tax on oil imports

the two nations are unable to reach a free trade pact,
according to a study published by two nonpartisan public policy
research groups.
    The Cato Institute of Washington and the Fraser Institute
of Vancouver said removing the remaining tariffs on cross
border trade would benefit both countries.
    But Cato chairman William Niskanen added "the two nations'
generally harmonious trade relations are probably not
sustainable without a new agreement."
    The United States and Canada, whose cross-border trade
totaled about 125 billion dlrs last year, have been holding
talks since last June on a pact to end the few trade barriers
remaining between their two countries.
    The U.S. put a deadline on the talks of October 1, but both
sides have said an agreement is likely despite tough bargaining
remained.
    Niskanen said if no pact is reached, bilateral trade ties
could deteriorate because of Congressional pressure on
President Reagan to implement trade laws more aggressively, and
this could hit some Canadian trade practices.
    He noted Canada is seeking foreign investment in its auto
industry, which could put strains on the considerable bilateral
free trade in U.S. and Canadian autos and parts.
    Niskanen also said the Canadian government is vulnerable to
a resurgence of economic nationalism which could restrict U.S.
exports to Canada.
    A free trade pact, backed by President Reagan and Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney, would open new markets for Canada and
enable its industries to achieve economies of scale, which
would also help it widen exports worldwide, he said.
    It would also increase the gross national products of both
countries.
    Niskanen said the goal of a pact should be to end all
tariffs within 10 years, lower subsidies on exports, set rules
for trade in services and investments, end curbs on government
procurement and agree ways to resolve trade disputes.

Caribbean nations formally opposed trade legislation pending in
Congress, saying it would curb their exports, slow development
and hinder its ability to repay foreign debt.
    Mario Rodriguez Montero, president of an Organization of
American States special committee on trade, said he was aware
of the large U.S. trade deficit, but added "the region should
not be the one affected by the trade bills."
    He said the causes of the deficit were the strong dollar
and the budget deficit, and "it is regrettable to solve it by a
trade bill that would only serve private U.S. interests."
    Rodriguez made the comment at a news conference after two
days of meetings with U.S. officials on trade bills now in
Congress that are designed to reduce the U.S. trade deficit,
which last year hit a record 166.3 billion dlrs.
    Congressional observers say the bills are aimed mainly at
Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and a few other nations with large,
annual trade surpluses with the United States.
    Mexico, Brazil and Venezuela are the only Latin nations
with large trade surpluses last year with the United States,
but even Mexico, with the largest, had a surplus of only 5.2
billion dlrs, against Japan's of 58.6 billion dlrs.
    The European Community has also opposed the bills.
    Rodriguez said the Latin and Caribbean nations backed the
Reagan Administration's opposition to many of the sections in
the legislation, including those to curb imports and to require
retaliation for foreign unfair trade practices.
    He told reporters the committee would likely mount a
campaign to fight the legislation when it comes up for debate
on the Senate floor, expected next week.
    Rodriguez said "the region needs trade to continue
development.  We hope this need will not be affected negatively
by trade legislation."
    Rodriguez said: "we need to keep the market opens -
especially the U.S. market - to obtain the necessary foreign
exchange not only to service the debt but also to continue
national development progress."
    President Reagan has said he would veto any legislation he
termed "protectionist," and his aides now are mounting a effort
to water down some of the objectionable provisions in the
legislation.
    Asked whether Reagan was ready to cast a veto, Rodriguez
said as yet "the administration is not in a veto frame of mind."

replace the U.S. tariff schedule with a new system to bring it
into line with international tariff categories, U.S. Trade
Representative Clayton Yeutter said.
    The new system will add such items as fiber optics and more
accurately define new composites, items not widely traded when
the current schedule was devised some 30 years ago.
    Yeutter said the Harmonized System, as the new schedule is
called, will change tariff categories and definitions to meet
the present-day needs of exporters and importers, but they
should pay about the same rates of duties.
    Yeutter said, "American exporters will find it far easier to
deal with one standardized worldwide system than the variety of
differing systems which they now face."
    He said the new system ended 12 years of multinational
negotiations to create the unified tariff schedule.
    Yeutter said government and business moves are based on
data from tariff schedules and the new system will improve
knowledge of trade flows and the quality of decision-making.
    He said 56 nations pledged to bring their standards under
the new system, with about half expected to join the system by
January 1988.

widen in fiscal 1987/88 beginning on July 1 after the
government relaxed restrictions on some imports including
luxury cars.
    The country has set its export target for the year at 1.1
billion U.S. Dlrs against imports of 1.805 billion dlrs,
compared with 1986/7's one billion dlrs of export earnings and
1.113 billion dlrs of imports.
    Commerce Minister Mohammad Abdul Munim said the changes
were aimed at encouraging export oriented industries to boost
foreign exchange earnings and imports of essential machinery
and raw materials, to increase industrial production.
    The government was easing procedures to enhance incentives
especially for exporters of textiles and frozen food and
importers of industrial machinery and raw materials, Munim told
reporters.
    Commerce Ministry officials told Reuters the import policy
covered only commercial imports amounting to 1.805 billion
dlrs. Imports of capital machinery and foodgrains by the
government were not included in the policy, they added.
    They said the country's total import bill (both commercial
and other imports) was expected to reach 2.7 billion dlrs in
the new year compared with 2.4 billion dlrs in 1986/87.
    The minister said ending restrictions on imports of cars
and dropping 50 pct sales tax on small cars would not harm the
economy.
    Munim said Bangladesh feared a further drop in prices for
its main export jute, "which will certainly affect our export
earnings" in the coming year.
    Bangladesh's jute exports fell to 410 mln dlrs from 500 mln
in 1986/87, according official figures.
    But Munim said exports of non-traditional items, which
accounted for over 40 pct of total exports this year, would
play a key role in achieving the 1987/88 export target.

    The U.S. Insists the EC complies with what it regards as an
unambiguous ruling from the world trade body GATT and
dismantles an export subsidy system which has led to Italy
taking an increasing share of the U.S. Pasta market.
    The sources said the EC, which currently provides subsidies
of around 16 cents a pound, offered a compromise in last week's
talks in Brussels but that this was rejected by the U.S.
    U.S. Assistant Special Trade Representative Jim Murphy has
returned to Washington ahead of a theoretical July 1 deadline
for agreement, set last August when the two sides resolved a
related dispute over EC restrictions on U.S. Citrus imports.
    The diplomatic sources said the citrus issue could be
reopened if the pasta dispute was not solved quickly. It was
also possible the U.S. Would reimpose a 40 pct tariff on EC
pasta, lifted when the citrus row was settled.

    In an interview with Reuters, Lyng also acknowledged he was

(EEP) could prove so indispensable to boosting U.S. exports
that the U.S. would have difficulty abandoning it.
    "Yes, I'm troubled with that a little bit," he said. "There's

    In recent months, USDA has offered subsidies on a growing

"just plain nonsensical as a long-term policy" and said he saw an

    "I'm sure there's an end to the expansion, but we are doing
this to accomplish our goal which is to regain the markets that
we've lost, to keep our products competitive and to let those,

we are prepared to continue to do this until we can come to

    September exports were 2.694 billion dlrs, slightly down

to 1.2 billion dlrs, against 1.32 billion dlrs in August.
    Salek said the accumulated surplus in the Jan-Sept period
was 7.857 billion dlrs, compared with 8.667 billion dlrs in a
similar 1986 period.
    Coffee accounted with 320 mln dlrs of exports, up from 222

15.4 billion dlrs of imports.
    He attributed the good surplus on exports of manufactured

additional 84 mln dlrs in trade sanctions against Japan later
this month, Reagan Administration officials said.
    President Reagan imposed 300 mln dlrs in sanctions on
Japanese goods last April for its failure to honor a 1986
agreement to end dumping semiconductors in the U.S. and third
country markets and to open its home market to U.S. goods.
    The move raised tariffs to 100 pct from about five pct on
Japanese color television sets, hand-held power tools and
portable computers.
    Reagan lifted 51 mln dlrs of the sanctions last June  after
Japan ended selling the semiconductors on the U.S. market at
below production costs.
    Semiconductors are the small silicon chips used for memory
and recall purposes in a wide variety of computers.
    The Administration officials said Commerce Department 
monitors showed that Japan was ending its dumping of the
semiconductors in third countries, where they had been taking
sales away from American-made semiconductors.
    They said it was likely the 51 mln dlrs in sanctions would
be lifted by the end of the month.
    The United States and Japan remain at odds over opening the
closed Japanese markets to U.S. goods.
    U.S. and Japanese officials reviewed Japan's compliance
with the agreement earlier this week.
    The periodic reviews are to continue and the remaining
sanctions to stay in force, the officials said, until Japan is
in full compliance with the semiconductor agreement.

international trade talks that most trade-distorting farm
subsidies be phased out over a five year period, Trade Minister
Pat Carney said.
    "Agricultural subsidies and trade barriers have created a
vicious circle which continues to cause problems of
overproduction and low commodity prices," Carney told the House

    Carney was outlining the government's new position on the
farm trade problem that was tabled on Tuesday in Geneva in the

and Trade).
    While few details were released, Carney said the government

new measures to ensure countries do not erect artificial
barriers.
    "Under the Canadian proposal, all countries would have to
ensure that domestic policies and programs to address the
specific needs of their farm sectors do not distort trade," a

 ]]></BODY><BODY><![CDATA[Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter
said on Monday that the U.S. free trade agreements with Canada
and Israel should help to pave the way for liberalizing the
global trading system.
    He said the Canadian and Israeli pacts will not set back
worldwide reform efforts under the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (GATT) as some critics feared but help them.
    The GATT talks began a year ago in Punta del Este, Uruguay
to liberalize the global trading system and to include in it
trade in agriculture and services such as banking.
    Yeutter made his remarks at a U.S.-Israeli trade meeting
marking the second year of their bilateral accord. The
Canadian-U.S. pact, signed by two sides two weeks ago, has yet
been approved by the U.S. Congress and Canadian Parliament.
    The two free trade agreements (FTA) would gradually remove
tariffs and other barriers to cross-border trade in goods and
many services.
    Yeutter said in the aftermath of the Canadian and Israeli
pacts "other countries have realized that if they want to
continue to have access to the world's largest market, they had
better get serious about improving the GATT."
    The pact with Israel, he said, is gradually increasing
shipments both ways and the Canadian pact will substantially
increase the gross national products in both countries.
    Yeutter also said the Canadian and Israeli pacts should
serve as important precedents for progress in GATT.
    Yeutter said, "increasing trade is one of the keys to
enhanced political and economic stability around the globe."
    He said, "a stronger GATT will enhance prosperity, not only
for advanced industrial nations, but also for other countries
that need to increase trade in order to better their standards
of living."
    Yeutter added it was important not to risk the progress
made in the Israeli and Canadian trade pacts by resorting to
protectionism.
    He was referring to trade legislation pending in Congress
that would force the United States to take retaliatory actions
against nations with large trade surpluses with the United
States if the countries practiced unfair trade.
    The legislation was prompted by a growing U.S. trade
deficit that hit 156 billion dlrs last year and is still
rising.
    Yeutter said the pressures for Congress to act were hard to
resist, but the pending legislation would undermine President
Reagan's efforts to liberalize the world trade.
    Yeutter renewed the threat of a White House veto.
    He said, "President Reagan will veto any bill that contains
serious flaws, and I believe that veto would be sustained."
