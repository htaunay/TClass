higher bid than the 27 dlrs per share offered by Waste
Management Inc <WNX>, Wall Street arbitrageurs said.
    Shares of ChemLawn shot up 11-5/8 to 29-3/8 in
over-the-counter- trading with 3.8 mln of the company's 10.1
mln shares changing hands by late afternoon.
    "This company could go for 10 times cash flow or 30 dlrs,
maybe 32 dollars depending on whether there is a competing
bidder," an arbitrageur said. Waste Management's tender offer,
announced before the opening today, expires March 25.
    "This is totally by surprise," said Debra Strohmaier, a
ChemLawn spokeswoman. The company's board held a regularly
scheduled meeting today and was discussing the Waste Management
announcement. She said a statement was expected but it was not
certain when it would be ready. 
    She was unable to say if there had been any prior contact
between Waste Management and ChemLawn officials.
    "I think they will resist it," said Elliott Schlang,
analyst at Prescott, Ball and Turben Inc. "Any company that
doesn't like a surprise attack would."
    Arbitrageurs pointed out it is difficult to resist tender
offers for any and all shares for cash. Schlang said ChemLawn
could try to find a white knight if does not want to be
acquired by Waste Management.
    Analyst Rosemarie Morbelli of Ingalls and Snyder said
ServiceMaster Companies L.P. <SVM> or Rollins Inc <ROL> were
examples of companies that could be interested.
    ChemLawn, with about two mln customers, is the largest U.S.
company involved in application of fertilizers, pesticides and
herbicides on lawns. Waste Management is involved in removal of
wastes.
    Schlang said ChemLawn's customer base could be valuable to
another company that wants to capitalize on a strong
residential and commercial distribution system.
    Both Schlang and Morbelli noted that high growth rates had
catapulted ChemLawn's share price into the mid-30's in 1983 but
the stock languished as the rate of growth slowed.
    Schlang said the company's profits are concentrated in the
fourth quarter. In 1986 ChemLawn earned 1.19 dlrs per share for
the full year, and 2.58 dlrs in the fourth quarter.
    Morbelli noted ChemLawn competes with thousands of
individual entrepreuers who offer lawn and garden care sevice.

market rumors it would spinoff all or part of its Shearson
Lehman Brothers Inc, but some analysts said the company may be
considering such a move because it is unhappy with the market
value of its stock.
    American Express stock got a lift from the rumor, as the
market calculated a partially public Shearson may command a
good market value, thereby boosting the total value of American
Express. The rumor also was accompanied by talk the financial
services firm would split its stock and boost its dividend.
    American Express closed on the New York Stock Exchange at
72-5/8, up 4-1/8 on heavy volume.
    American Express would not comment on the rumors or its
stock activity.
    Analysts said comments by the company at an analysts'
meeting Tuesday helped fuel the rumors as did an announcement
yesterday of management changes.
    At the meeting, company officials said American Express
stock is undervalued and does not fully reflect the performance
of Shearson, according to analysts.
    Yesterday, Shearson said it was elevating its chief
operating officer, Jeffery Lane, to the added position of
president, which had been vacant. It also created four new
positions for chairmen of its operating divisions.
    Analysts speculated a partial spinoff would make most
sense, contrary to one variation on market rumors of a total
spinoff.
    Some analysts, however, disagreed that any spinoff of
Shearson would be good since it is a strong profit center for
American Express, contributing about 20 pct of earnings last
year.
    "I think it is highly unlikely that American Express is
going to sell shearson," said Perrin Long of Lipper Analytical.
He questioned what would be a better investment than "a very
profitable securities firm."
    Several analysts said American Express is not in need of
cash, which might be the only reason to sell a part of a strong
asset.
    But others believe the company could very well of
considered the option of spinning out part of Shearson, and one
rumor suggests selling about 20 pct of it in the market.
    Larry Eckenfelder of Prudential-Bache Securities said he
believes American Express could have considered a partial
spinoff in the past.
    "Shearson being as profitable as it is would have fetched a
big premium in the market place. Shearson's book value is in
the 1.4 mln dlr range. Shearson in the market place would
probably be worth three to 3.5 bilion dlrs in terms of market
capitalization," said Eckenfelder.
    Some analysts said American Express could use capital since
it plans to expand globally.
    "They have enormous internal growth plans that takes
capital. You want your stock to reflect realistic valuations to
enhance your ability to make all kinds of endeavors down the
road," said E.F. Hutton Group analyst Michael Lewis.
    "They've outlined the fact that they're investing heavily
in the future, which goes heavily into the international
arena," said Lewis. "...That does not preclude acquisitions and
divestitures along the way," he said.
    Lewis said if American Express reduced its exposure to the
brokerage business by selling part of shearson, its stock might
better reflect other assets, such as the travel related
services business.
    "It could find its true water mark with a lesser exposure
to brokerage. The value of the other components could command a
higher multiple because they constitute a higher percentage of
the total operating earnings of the company," he said.
     Lewis said Shearson contributed 316 mln in after-tax
operating earnings, up from about 200 mln dlrs in 1985.

a bid by the London-based Swedish financier Erik Penser to
secure a large stake in Swedish Match <SMBS ST>, one of the
companies at the core of their business empire.
    A statement issued by the Wallenberg holding companies AB
Investor and Forvaltnings AB Providentia said they had taken
over an option held by Nobel Industrier Sweden AB to acquire 33
pct of the voting rights in Swedish Match.
    Thre Wallenbergs paid Nobel Industrier <NOBL ST>, in which
Penser group has a 72 pct stake, about 20 pct over the market
price for the Swedish Match option, the statement said.
    Swedish Match's B shares open to foreign buyers closed at
424 crowns on Friday. The A shares -- with increased voting
rights -- closed at 450 crowns for the restricted and 455 for
the free shares.
    The statement said the deal increased Investor's stake to
49.4 pct of the voting rights and 14.8 pct of the share capital
while Providentia is left holding 34.1 pct of the voting rights
and 14.5 pct of the share capital in Swedish Match.
    The Wallenbergs' stake in Swedish Match had previously
amounted to 52 pct of the voting rights in the company.
    The Swedish Match deal will cost the Wallenbergs about 400
mln crowns, share analysts said, making it one of the most
expensise moves the group has undertaken in the last four years
to defend its far-flung interests from outside predators.
    The Wallenbergs originally sold Nobel Industrier, an arms
and chemicals group, to Penser in 1984 to pay for buying Volvo
<VOLV ST> out of two other key group companies, Atlas Copco
<ASTS ST> and Stora Koppabergs <SKPS ST>.
    Since then, the Wallenbergs were ousted as the largest
shareholders in SKF (SKFR ST> by Skanska AB <SKBS ST> and
Frederik Lundberg wrested control of Incentive AB from them.
    Lundberg, a Zurich-based Swedish property tycoon, also
managed to acquire a 25 pct stake in another Wallenberg
company, the diary equipment firm Alfa -Laval AB <ALFS ST>.
    During 1986, the Wallenbergs have been concentrating on
building up their stake in Investor and Providentia to prevent
any raid on the heart of their business empire.
    But analysts say the Wallenbergs' position in the
electrical engineering firm ASEA AB <ASEA ST> is also too small
at 12.6 pct of the voting rights and there has been growing
speculation that the group will be forced to sell off fringe
interests to protect its core activities.

    Bank of New York and the partners will retain about 10 pct

    RMJ is the holding company of RMJ Securities, one of the

    It is also involved in broking notes, obligations and other

    Lacy said Exco had been considering buying a U.S.
Government securities broker for the past four years and had
made an offer for RMJ when it was sold by Security Pacific Corp

    B and C managing director Peter Goldie said RMJ would be
bought at about the same multiple as Exco, suggesting net
income of around 16 mln dlrs.
    The company's earnings had not been hit by the halving of
brokerage fees some 14 months ago as volumes had since doubled.
    Lacy said that RMJ employed some 300 people, with 200 in
the brokerage business and about 70 in its <SMS> unit, which
provided computer software for the financial services

    RMJ Securities had offices in New York, where total market

considering a spinoff of part of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc,
said it is studying a range of options for its brokerage unit
that could improve Shearon's access to capital and help it meet
broadening international competition.
    In a joint statement, American Express and Shearson said
the actions under consideration are an integral part of
American Express' worldwide financial services strategy and
that the two companies have been having both internal and
external discussions on the matters.
    American Express said no decision has been reached on the
strategic options and that it and Shearson could ultimately
decide to follow growth plans already in place.
    Last week, rumors circulated on Wall Street that the
financial services giant was considering a spinoff of part of
Shearson and there was speculation it may be considering
selling a stake to a Japanese firm. Analysts said the
speculation also focused on American Express selling 20 pct of
the profitable brokerage firm to the public.
    There was some speculation that American Express had also
considered a total spinoff of Shearson, but the plan was
considered highly unlikely, analysts said.
     American Express said in the statement on Sunday that it
will not comment on rumors and speculation and a spokesman
would not go beyond the statement. The company also remained
silent last Thursday and Friday, as rumors drove American
Express stock up a total of 5-1/2 dlrs in two days to bring it
to a Friday close at 74.
     It said it issued the statement on Sunday because a
similar statement was being circulated to employees.
    Analysts have been divided on whether it makes sense for
American Express to give up a stake in the wholly-owned
brokerage, which improved its after-tax earnings by about 50
pct in the last year.
    Some analysts said American Express may consider spinning
off part of Shearson because it is concerned that its stock
price does not fully reflect the value of the brokerage firm.
     Shearson contributed 316 mln dlrs of American Express'
1.25 billion dlr net in 1986.
    American Express' ambitious plans for international growth
may be also enhanced by the added cash that spinning out part
of Shearson would bring. Analysts speculated that all of
Shearson would have a market value of about 3.5 billion dlrs.
    To some however, the need for added capital is puzzling.
"(American) Express is in a position where they can raise
capital if they need to," said Larry Eckenfelder of
Prudential-Bache Securities.
    Analysts said rumors were fed by the reorganization of
Shearson management Wednesday. Chief operating officer Jeffrey
Lane got the added, previously vacant, post of president.
     The reorganization also created four new positions for
chairmen of Shearson's operating divisions, a move analysts
speculated would allow Shearson to be a stand alone company.
     Analysts, contacted on Sunday said the statement does
little to clarify last week's market speculation. It does
confirm, however, that the financial services firm, which
unsuccessfully attempted to expand Shearson with a major
acquisition last year, is looking beyond its own walls for
growth and positioning in the global market competition.
    Late last year, Shearson's takeover offer to the E.F.
Hutton Group Inc was rejected by Hutton, and analysts said
there had been speculation that Shearson also was rebuffed when
it approached another major Wall Street brokerage.

Purolator Courier Corp said it has agreed to be acquired for
about 265 mln dlrs by a company formed by E.F. Hutton LBO Inc
and certain managers of Purolator's U.S. courier business.
    Analysts have said that Purolator has been for sale for
some time. Purolator announced earlier it was mulling a
takeover bid, but analysts wrongly predicted the offer was from
another courier company.
    Hutton LBO, a wholly owned subsidiary of E.F. Hutton Group
Inc, will be majority owner of the company.
    Hutton said the acquiring company, PC Acquisition Inc, is
paying 35 dlrs cash per share for 83 pct of Purolator's stock
in a tender offer to begin Thursday. The rest of the shares
will be purchased for securities and warrants to buy stock in a
subsidiary of PC Acquisition, containing Purolator's U.S.
courier operations.
    If all the shares of Purolator are tendered, shareholders
would receive for each share 29 dlrs cash, six dlrs in
debentures, and a warrant to buy shares in a subsidiary of PC
Acquisition containing the U.S. courier operations.
    Hutton said in the merger shareholders would get 46 mln
dlrs aggregate amount of guaranteed debentures due 2002 of PC
Acquisition and warrants to buy 15 pct of the common stock of
the PC courier subsidiary. Hutton said the company has valued
the warrants at two to three dlrs per share.
    Purolator's stock price closed at 35.125 dlrs on Friday.
While some analysts estimated the company was worth in the mid
30s, at least one said it would be worth 38 to 42 dlrs.
    This follows sales of two other Purolator units. It agreed
recently to sell its Canadian Courier unit to Onex Capital for
170 mln dlrs, and previously sold its auto filters business.
    Purolator retains its Stant division, which makes closure
caps for radiators and gas tanks. A Hutton spokesman said the
firm is reviewing its options on Stant.
    Purolator's courier business has been lagging that of its
U.S. rivals because of the high price it paid in the past
several years to add air delivery to its ground fleet.
    E.F. Hutton will provide 279 mln dlrs of its funds to
complete the transaction. This so-called "bridge" financing
will be replaced later with long-term debt most likely in the
form of bank loans, Hutton said. Hutton LBO is committed to
keeping the courier business, its president Warren Idsal said.
    "Purolator lost 120 mln dlrs over the last two years
largely due to U.S. courier operations, which we believe the
management is turning around. We belive it will be a very
serious competitor in the future," said Idsal.
    William Taggart, chief executive officer of U.S. Courier

one of the two groups vying for control of Viacom International
Inc, offered to sweeten his bid for the company by 1.50 dlrs a
share cash and 1.50 dlrs in securities.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Redstone, who controls Dedham, Mass.,-based National Amusements
Inc, a theater chain operator, offered to raise the cash
portion of its Viacom offer to 42 dlrs a share from 40.50 dlrs.
    Redstone also raised the face value of the preferred stock
he is offering to 7.50 dlrs from six dlrs.
    The Redstone offer, which is being made through Arsenal
Holdings Inc, a National Amusements subsidiary set up for that
purpose, which also give Viacom shareholders one-fifth of a
share of Arsenal common stock after the takeover.
    Viacom said earlier today it received revised takeover bids
from Redstone and MCV Holdings Inc, a group led by Viacom
management which is competing with Redstone for control of the
company and already has a formal merger agreement with Viacom.
    The company did not disclose the details of the revised
offers, but said a special committee of its board would review
them later today.
    The Redstone group, which has a 19.5 pct stake in Viacom,
and the management group, which has a 5.4 pct stake, have both
agreed not to buy more shares of the company until a merger is
completed, unless the purchases are part of a tender offer for
at least half of the outstanding stock.
    The two rivals also signed confidentiality agreements,
which give them access to Viacom's financial records provided
they keep the information secret.
    In his SEC filing, Redstone, who estimated his cost of
completing the takeover at 2.95 billion dlrs, said Bank of
America is confident it can raise 2.275 billion dlrs.
    Besides the financing it would raise through a bank
syndicate, Bank of America has also agreed to provide a
separate 25 mln dlr for the limited purpose of partial
financing and has committed to provide another 592 mln dlrs,
Redstone said.
    Merrill Lynch, Pierce Fenner and Smith Inc has increased
its underwriting commitment to 175 mln dlrs of subordinated
financing debt for the Viacom takeover, from the 150 mln dlrs
it agreed to underwrite earlier, Redstone said.
    Redstone said his group would contribute more than 475 mln
dlrs in equity toward the takeover.
    The Redstone equity contribution to the takeover would
consist of all of his group's 6,881,800 Viacom common shares
and at least 118 mln dlrs cash, he said.
    The new offer, the second sweetened deal Redstone has
proposed in his month-long bidding war with management, also
contains newly drawn up proposed merger documents, he said.
    Last week, the management group submitted what it called
its last offer for the company, valued at 3.1 mln dlrs and
consisting of 38.50 dlrs a share cash, preferred stock valued
at eight dlrs a share and equity in the new company. Redstone's
previous offer had been valued at 3.2 billion dlrs.

Inc, one of the largest U.S. entertainment companies, pitted a
management group and other investors against National
Amusements Inc, a closely held theater operator.
    Both sides raised their bids over the weekend. A source
close to the management side insisted that timing was on his
side. He said if outside directors approve the management
proposal, a merger plan could be put to a vote of shareholders
with proxy material going out late this week. "It would take 20
days from the day we mail," said the source.
    The source predicted National Amusements, controlled by
investor Sumner Redstone, would need "half a year" to complete
a tender offer because of the regulatory approvals that must
accompany any change in control of Viacom's broadcast licenses
and cable television franchises.
    Redstone was not available for comment.
    Some of Wall Street's arbitrage players said it was a rare
situation that could only be enjoyed - a true bidding war. One
said Redstone could begin a tender offer whenever he wanted and
if enough people were convinced his proposal was superior to
the Viacom management plan, he would have a chance to win.
    The independent directors of Viacom were called into a
meeting today. Word on a decision was expected early tomorrow.
    Viacom shares climbed 2-1/2 to 50-3/8 by midafternoon. One
major Wall Street firm issued a sell recommendation. "We think
we're at the end now, in terms of bidding," said the firm's
arbitrageur, who spoke on condition he not be identified.
    Both Redstone's proposal and the management proposal would
create a restructured company heavily leveraged with debt. The
management plan would result in a balance sheet with about 2.5
billion dlrs in debt and nearly 500 mln dlrs in preferred
stock, convertible into 45 pct of the common stock.
    Redstone's newest proposal offers holders 42 dlrs in cash,
a fraction of a share of exchangeable preferred stock with a
value of 7.50 dlrs, and one-fifth of a share of common stock
stock of Arsenal Holdings, representing 20 pct of the equity
interest in the restructured Viacom. One arbitrageur calculated
the equity in the Redstone plan was worth 2.50 dlrs making the
total package worth 52 dlrs per share.
    Management offered 38.50 dlrs in cash, exchangeable
preferred stock worth 8.50 dlrs and a fractional share of
convertible preferred. The arbitrageur said the equity portion
was worth about 4.00 dlrs for a total of 51 dlrs.
    Redstone's newest plan raised the amount of interest he
would pay on the cash portion of his offer for every day beyond
April 30 that a merger with Arsenal is not consummated. The
plan calls for intest to be paid at an annual rate of nine pct
during May and 12 pct thereafter. Previously Redstone offered
eight pct interest.
    Other arbitrageurs said both Redstone and the management
group, led by president and chief executive Terrence Elkes,
were offering high prices. "Redstone really wants to own the
company," one said. Another said management seemed to have the
edge on the timing issue.
    Redstone's company owns 19.6 pct ov Viacom's 35 mln shares.
    A Wall Street analyst said it was hard to determine what
the equity in the newly leveraged company would be worth. He
noted as an example that new stock in FMC Corp <FMC>, which
adopted a highly leveraged structure last year, inititally
traded at 12.50 dlrs per share, dipped to nine dlrs, and is now
just over 30 dlrs.
    Last week, Viacom reported fourth quarter earnings fell two
two cts per share from 23 cts. The company said interest costs
from several acquisitions affected results.
    Shares of Warner Communications Inc <WCI> rose 7/8 to
31-1/8. Analysts noted Warner owns warrants to purchase 3.25
mln Viacom shares at 35 dlrs and another 1.25 mln shares at
37.50 dlrs.
    Chris Craft Industries <CCN>, which owns a stake in Warner,
rose 1-1/4 to 22-3/4.
    Viacom was created in 1970 and spun off from CBS Inc <CBS>.

nine satellite television services and owns television and

has had discussions with several American Medical International
Inc shareholders and sees support for a restructuring of the
company.
    Pesch said he has discussed his sweetened, 1.91 billion dlr
takeover bid for American Medical with several large
shareholders, including the biggest investor, the Bass family
of Texas. However, the Bass family has not indicated support
one way or the other for his offer, he said.
    Pesch, in an interview with Reuters, said based on the
conversations he held with shareholders, he could not guage
whether he had majority support. He said, however, there is
support for his offer.
    Pesch would not identify shareholders with whom he held
discussions other than the Bass family and the Wedge Group Inc,
the only other holder of more than five pct of American Medical
stock.
    Earlier today, Wedge Group, which has a 5.5 pct stake, 
said it held discussions with Pesch, American Medical
management and other American Medical shareholders.
    Wedge, in a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, said it believes a restructuring of American
Medical and its business would be "highly desirable and
appropriate at this time."
    "That's the sort of position that I find a large segment of
shareholders of AMI really share," said Pesch.
    Pesch said he held discussions with Wedge about joining his
takeover effort, in which he is offering 17 dlrs cash, four
dlrs in preferred stock and one dlr in common stock for each
American Medical share. Wedge said it has no plans to join in
an effort to seek control of American Medical, but it would not
rule out a future takeover try.
    Pesch said he did not discuss a joint takeover proposal
with the Bass family.
    Some analysts saw the Wedge statement as a boost to Pesch's
takeover effort and a further sign that there could be some
shareholder dissatisfaction following American Medical's
previous rejection of a 20 dlr per share all cash offer from
Pesch.
    American Medical is expected to resist Pesch's latest bid.
Larry Feinberg, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc said a
management-led leveraged buyout cannot be ruled out.
    An American Medical spokesman said the company will comment
on the new Pesch offer by March 10.
    Analysts continue to view the Bass family as a factor in
the outcome of the bid for control of American Medical.
    The Bass family holds an 11. 6 pct stake in American
Medical, and the company has previously said the investors
support management's internal plan to improve the company's
performance. The Bass family would not comment on American
Medical or Pesch.
    Pesch, who led the leveraged buyout of Republic Health Corp
last year, continues to face a credibilty problem on Wall
Street because of the long time it took to finish the Republic
acquisition.
    Republic also has substantial debt, and has left wall
street questioning whether financing can be completed for the
much larger American Medical takeover proposal.
    Pesch's first offer for American Medical was made without
an investment banking firm, another cause for concern to Wall
Street. However, Pesch entered his second offer with
representation from Donaldson, Lufkin, and Jenrette Securities
and Security Pacific Merchant Banking Group.
    "I don't have any doubt that the current transaction can be
worked out and completed, provided we get to the point where
Ami management will sit down and talk in a friendly
environment," Pesch said.
    Pesch would not elaborate on what type of financing
arrangements are being made. He did say if he succeeds in
acquiring American Medical he plans to keep much of American
Medical management in place.
    He said he plans to combine the company with Republic to
form an efficient network of hospitals.
    Analysts said they do not believe a much higher offer could
be made for American Medical.
    Byron Nimocks of E.F. Hutton Group said improved second
fiscal quarter earnings could make American Medical stock worth
about 20 dlrs per share.
    Nimocks estimates American Medical earnings for the second
quarter ended February 28 could be 35 cts, compared to a 95 ct
loss last year.
    Nimocks said Pesch's revised offer is not worth much more
than the 20 dlrs cash offered previously.
    But Feinberg said there is a better chance a transaction
could be completed because of the revised structure of the
offer. "I think it's much more doable," he said.
    Analysts have said American Medical has begun a turnaround
by replacing some members of management and reducing costs.

believe another suitor will top the 265 mln dlr bid for
Purolator Courier Corp by E.F. Hutton LBO Inc and a management
group from Purolator's courier division.
    There had been speculation another offer might be
forthcoming, but analysts mostly believe the 35 dlrs per share
price being paid by Hutton and the managers' PC Acquisition Inc
is fully valued.
    Analysts and some Wall Street sources said they doubted
another bidder would emerge since Purolator had been for sale
for sometime before a deal was struck with Hutton Friday.
    Purolator's stock slipped 3/8 today to close at 34-3/4. It
had been trading slightly higher than the 35 dlr offer on
Friday. At least one analyst Friday speculated the company
might fetch 38 to 42 dlrs per share.
    analysts and wall street sources doubted a competitive
offer would emerge since the company has been for sale for
sometime before the deal with Hutton was struck Friday.
    Hutton had been in talks with Purolator's adviser, Dillon,
Read and Co since late December, a Hutton spokesman said.
    Hutton is offering 35 dlrs cash per share for 83 pct of the
shares. If all shares are tendered, shareholders would receive
29 dlrs cash, six dlrs in debentures, and warrants for stock in
a subsidiary of PC Acquisition containing the Purolator U.S.
courier operation. Hutton values the warrants at two to three
dlrs per share.
    Wall Street sources also said today that a rival bidder
might be discouraged by a breakup fee Purolator would have to
pay if it ends its agreement with Hutton. The sources would not
reveal the amount of the fee, which will be noted in documents
on the transaction to be made public later this week.

Commission (SEC) is looking for possible securities laws
violations in connection with an unsuccessful 1986 bid by
Hollywood producer Burt Sugarman to take over TRE Corp,
attorneys contacted by SEC investigators said.
    During the takeeover attempt, a unit of Sugarman's Giant
Group Ltd at one point held a 9.9 pct stake in TRE.
    It had help in that effort from Jefferies Group Inc, a Los
Angeles investment banking firm which sold it an option on a
portion of the shares Sugarman eventually acquired.
    In addition, a company controlled by Sugarman raised 35 mln
dlrs in a debt offering underwritten by Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc with help from Jefferies, and used a portion of the
proceeds to buy TRE stock.
    Finally, Reliance Group Holdings Inc acquired nearly six
pct of TRE, according to an SEEC filing.
    The attorneys, who asked not to be identified, said the SEC
was investigating whether Sugarman and other firms with TRE
holdings were working together without disclosing their
cooperation, as would be required by the federal securities
laws.
    One attorney said SEC probers also were examining whether
Sugarman and Drexel had made adequate disclosures of its
intended usage of the proceeds in the prospectus for the 35 mln
dlr bond offering.
    A TRE spokesman confirmed that TRE, since December a unit
of Aluminum Co of America, had been contacted by SEC
investigators and was cooperating with the probe.
    The spokesman added that TRE Chairman Leopold Wyler had
been interviewed by the SEC probers.
    A Jefferies spokesman said the SEC had asked for
information a few months ago as part of an informal probe.
    The spokesman said Jefferies had cooperated with the agency
and had heard nothing more since that time.
    "To the best of our knowledge, Jefferies is not the target
of a formal SEC investigation" in connection with the TRE bid,
he said.
    A Drexel spokesman acknowledged that his firm had
underwritten the debt offering for Sugarman but added:
    "We had nothing to do with TRE."
    As a matter of policy, the SEC routinely declines to
comment on its enforcement activities.

Hotels Ltd <SHLH.HK>'s stock soared on speculation of a
takeover battle between major shareholders the Kadoorie family
and the Evergo Industrial Enterprise Ltd <EVGH.HK> group, stock
brokers said.
    They noted heavy buying in Hk Hotel shares after an
announcement by Evergo's <China Entertainment and Land
Investment Co Ltd> unit that it bought about 20 pct of Hk
Hotels from the firm's deputy chairman David Liang for 1.06
billion dlrs. The stock rose 12 H.K. Dlrs to 62 dlrs today.
    Thomas Lau, Evergo's executive director, declined comment
on whether the group is seeking a further stake in Hk Hotels.
But he told Reuters the group will hold the 20 pct stake bought
from Liang as long term investment.
    He said Evergo "was attracted by the underlying strength of
Hk Hotels."
    Analysts said Evergo may be looking for a possible
redevelopment of the Peninsula Hotel, one of Asia's best known
hotels, and another site on Hong Kong island. Both are owned by
Hk Hotels.
    <Lai Sun Garment Co ltd> yesterday said it acquired a 10
pct stake in Hk Hotels from Liang for 530 mln dlrs.
    Lau denied any link between China Entertainment and Lai Sun
on their acquisitions of the Hk Hotels stake.
    "It is purely coincidence," he said.
    But analysts were not so certain, saying that the Evergo
group, which has a reputation as a corporate raider, may team
up with Lai Sun Garment for a takeover.
    Lau also denied any contact with the Kadoorie family, which
analysts estimate has more than 20 pct of Hk Hotels. Michael
Kadoorie is chairman of Hk Hotels.
    Lau said two representatives of Evergo will be nominated to
the Hk Hotels board.
    A source close to the Kadoorie family said the family has
not considered any countermoves so far.
    Analysts said it would be difficult for Evergo and the
Kadoorie family to cooperate because of different management
styles.
    "Evergo may want to split up the hotel management and
property developments of Hk Hotels but that strategy may not
fit the conservative Kadoorie family," said an analyst who asked
not to be named.
    Another analyst noted the price of Hk Hotels had been
distorted by the takeover talks because its net asset value is
only worth about 50 dlrs a share. The offers by Evergo and Lai
Sun were for 53 dlrs a share, though that is well below the
current trading price.
    Trading was suspended today in shares of Lai Sun, Evergo,
China Entertainment and the group's associate <Chinese Estates
Ltd>.
    Chinese Estates lost 25 cents to 20.15 dlrs yesterday,
China Entertainment five to 8.60 dlrs and Evergo one to 74

Sun Chemical Corp <SNL>.
    Outboard was up 3-1/8 to 34-5/8. On Tuesday it rose 1-3/8
to 31-1/2 Tuesday.
    A report on Cable News Network today said Sun Chemical has
4.9 pct of Outboard and is conducting a study on whether to go
for control of the whole company.
    An Outboard Marine spokesman would not comment on the
rumor.
    The cable program said a buyout of Outboard would be for up
to 40 dlrs a share, or for a total of 680 mln dlrs.
    A spokesman for Sun Chemical was not immediately available.
    Outboard Marine last June adopted a shareholder rights plan
that will be triggered when a person or group acquires
beneficial ownership of 20 pct or more of its common or begins
a tender offer that would result in 30 pct ownership.
    Wayne Jones, vice president at Outboard for strategic
planning, said management wants to stay independent. "We are
not trying to sell the company. We are proceeding with our
strategic plans," he said.
    That plan includes integrating five boat companies that
Outboard Marine has bought since the middle of December. Jones
said all five will cost between 100 mln dlrs to 120 mln dlrs.
    An analyst who wanted anonymity said 40 dlrs a share is a
"decent" price for outboard. "A bdding war to 50 or 60 dlrs a
share is stretching it. Maybe 45 dlrs a share tops," he said.
    Outboard, which has 17 mln shares outstanding, is in
registration for a two mln common share offering with Morgan
Stanley Inc. It makes sense, the analyst said, for Sun Chemical
to strike before the offering is underway.

Amusements, Inc, predicted he can win regulatory approvals to
wrap up the 3.4 billion dlr acquisition of Viacom International
Inc in 60 to 90 days.
    Redstone, 63, catapulted himself into the big leagues of
entertainment early today when a group of Viacom managers and
their financial backers decided not to top National's bid.
    "We've had counsel working for some time in every region
where Viacom has cable televison systems" Redstone told Reuters
in a telephone interview.
    Redstone also said "Viacom is committed to working very
closely with us to obtain approvals." Viacom has been seeking
approvals for transfer of its broadcast licenses and cable
systems since September when its management group first
advanced a buyout plan.
    But Redstone turned the situation into a spirited bidding
contest which was capped by the announcement this morning that
Viacom's independent directors on behalf of Viacom entered into
a defintive merger agreement with National.
    National is a family business which operates a chain of
movie theaters. It is dwarfed by Viacom.
    Redstone said he was weary after talks dragged on through
the night but also excited at the prospect of running a leading
electronic media company. He noted that the number of motion
picture admissions in the U.S. has shown no growth in 15 years.
    Of nine satellite television channels operated by Viacom,
four are motion-picture oriented pay channels. Redstone said
exclusive contracts with pay television networks are the
emerging trend. "Up until recently you could see any motion
picture on any pay channel," Redstone said.
    He noted Viacom has exclusive agreements with two studios
and plans to sign a deal with a third company next month.
    Redstone said the management group's investment bankers
will be paid what is due for termination of its merger
agreement. Such fees could total about 30 mln dlrs. "That will
be a company expense," Redstone said.
    He said BankAmerica <BAC> Corp has had numerous inquiries
from lenders who want to participate in a 2.25 billion dlr
financing for the deal. BankAmerica will provide 592 mln dlrs.
    After the merger, Viacom will be a subsidiary of National

the bidding for Piedmont Aviation Inc by offering either to buy
Piedmont suitor USAir Group or, alternatively, to merge with
Piedmont and USAir.
    Piedmont's board was meeting today, and Wall Street
speculated the board was discussing opposing bids from Norfolk
Southern Corp and USAir. The TWA offer was announced shortly
after the Piedmont board meeting was scheduled to begin.
    TWA offered to buy USAir for 52 dlrs cash per share. It
also said it was the largest shareholder of USAir and
threatened to go directly to USAir shareholders with an offer
for 51 pct of the stock at a lower price.
    TWA also said it believed its offer was a better deal for
USAir shareholders than an acquisition of Piedmont, but it said
it alternatively would discuss a three-way combination of the
airlines.
    Market sources and analysts speculated that TWA chairman
Carl Icahn made the offer in order to put his own airline into
the takeover arena.
    "We're just wondering if he's not just trying to get TWA
into play. There's speculation on the street he just wants to
move onto somthing else," said one arbitrager. "We think TWA
might just be putting up a trial balloon."
    Analysts said the offer must be taken seriously by USAir,
but that the airline will probably reject it because the price
is relatively low compared to other airline deals.
    They also said Icahn must prove his offer credible by
revealing financing arrangements. "They need to show their
commitment and their ability to finance. I think it's a
credible offer," said Timothy Pettee, a Bear Stearns analyst.
    "I think it's certainly on the low end of relative values
of airline deals," said Pettee. Pettee estimated 58 dlrs would
be in a more reasonable range based on other airline mergers.
    USAir stock soared after TWA made public its offer. A
spokesman for USAir declined comment, and said USAir had not
changed its offer for Piedmont. USAir offered of buy 50 pct of
that airline's stock for 71 dlrs cash per share and the balance
for 73 dlrs per share in USAir stock.
    USAir closed up 5-3/8 at 49-1/8 on volume of 1.9 mln
shares.
    Piedmont, which slipped 1/2 to close at 69-5/8, also
remained silent on the TWA action. Piedmont has an outstanding
65 dlr cash per share offer from Norfolk Southern Corp.
    Norfolk Southern declined comment, but said it stuck with
its offer for Piedmont. Norfolk owns about 20 pct of Piedmont
and opened the bidding when it said it would propose a takeover
of Piedmont.
    Some analysts said Icahn may be trying to acquire USAir to
make his own airline a more attractive takeover target.
    "Icahn I think had wanted to sell his airline and there
were no takers. I think the strategy might have called for
making his investment more attractive. One way to accomplish
that specific objective is to go out and acquire other
airlines," said Andrew Kim of Eberstadt Fleming.
    "I don't know whose going to buy them, but at least this
way it becomes a much more viable package," said Kim.
    But Icahn's financing ability for such a transaction
remains in doubt, in part because of TWA's heavy debt load.
    Wall street sources said TWA has some cash with which to do
the offer.
    The sources said Icahn has not lined up outside financial
advisers and plans to make his own arrangements.
   Icahn earlier this year abandoned plans to buy USX Corp <X>
and still retains 11 pct of that company's stock.
    Some Wall street sources said the financier's USX plan was
impacted by the cloud hanging over his adviser, Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc, because of Wall Street's insider trading scandal.
    Industry sources also predicted USAir might reject the TWA
offer on price and financing concerns. "It's littered with
contingencies and it doesn't even have a financing
arrangement," said one executive at another major airline.
    But the executive conceded a merged TWA-USAir would be a
strong contender with USAir's east coast route system and
planned west coast presence from PSA. USAir could feed the
intenrational flights of TWA, which has a midwest presence in
its St. Louis hub. Adding Piedmont, dominant in the southeast,
to the mix would develop an even stronger force.
    The combined entity would also have TWA's pars reservation
system.
    Such a merger would be complex and analysts said it would
result in an airline iwth an 18 pct market share.

    Late yesterday, Hughes said it had terminated the merger
agreement because Baker would not agree to an alternative

previously found unacceptable a U.S. Justice Department consent
decree that would have required broader divestitures.
    Baker said it has not obtained any satisfactory explanation
from Hughes of its objections to the provisions of the Justice
Department consent decree.
    Hughes yesterday adjourned the special meeting at which
shareholders were to vote on the merger without permitting the
counting of votes on the deal.  Baker said it believes the vote
was overwhelmingly in favor of the merger.
    Baker said the new terms that Hughes proposed for the
merger, as an alternative to the consent decree, were "more
burdensome" than those of the consent decree themselves.
    Baker said divestitures under the consent decree would
reduce revenues for the combined company by about 65 mln dlrs
or three pct.
    Baker said it will continue to pursue the divestitures of
the units named in the consent decree.
    It said its suit names as defendants Hughes and certain of

rejected Trans World Airlines Inc's offer to acquire USAir for
52 dlrs per share in cash as grossly in adequate and not in the
best interests of USAir shareholders, employees or passengers.
    The company said the unsolicited bid by the Carl C.
Icahn-led TWA was "highly conditional."
    USAir said its board and that of Piedmont Aviation Inc
<PIE> met separately yesterday to consider USAir's offer to
acquire 50.1 pct of Piedmont for 71 dlrs per share and
remaining shares for 1.5 to 1.9 common shares each, valued at
about 73 dlrs per share based on the average closing price of
USAir common during a period just before the merger.
    The company said it is continuing talks with Piedmont on
arriving at a definitive merger agreement and the two companies
hope to reach one very shortly.
    USAir said "In light of the highly conditional nature and
other terms of the TWA offer, the timing of the offer and the
circumstances under which it was made, USAir Group believes
that the purpose of the TWA offer is to interfere with USAir
Group's proposed acquisition of Piedmont.
    "TWA's proposal is nothing more than an attempt by Carl
Icahn to disrupt at the eleventh hour USAir Group's acquisition
of Piedmont, a transaction which the USAir Group board views as
most beneficial to USAir Group shareholders, employees and
passengers and which Mr. Icahn obviously regards as contrary to
his own personal interests."
    USAir said its board has authorized counsel to explore all
appropriate legal remedies against what it called TWA's
last-minute attempt to interfere with USAir Group's acquisition
of Piedmont.
    The company said conditions to the TWA offer include TWA
obtaining financing, the USAir board redeeming defensive rights
issued to shareholders last year and acting to render the "fair
price" provision contained in USAir's charter inapplicable to
the TWA offer and Transportation Department approval.

chairman John Shad said progress was being made in stopping
insider trading, but the chairman of a House subcommittee with
jurisdiction over securities laws said he was concerned about
conditions on Wall Street.
    "Greed has created a feeding frenzy on Wall Street and in
the process laws are broken and multi-billion dlr corporations
have become easy prey," Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass, the
chairman of the Telecommunications and Finance said at the
start of a hearing on SEC activities.
    "Congress is understandably nervous. We perceive the
current scandals as a warning of even worse things to come,"
Markey said. "The frenzy and disruption created by merger mania
is particularly distressing."
    Shad said the recent cases involving Ivan Boesky, Dennis
Levine and others was a warning that those who engage in
insider trading were taking a heavy risk of imprisonment, high
fines and disbarment from the securities industry.
    "Insider trading has not been eradicated, but it has been
inhibited and multimillions of dollars of profits that Boesky
and others have been siphoning off the markets are now flowing
through to legitimate investors and traders," Shad said in his
statement.
    Shad said insider trading cases involved only 10 pct or
less of SEC enforcement actions in recent years but they have
increased significantly to 125 cases brought during the past
five years compared to 77 cases in the preceeding 47 years.
    Markey said he did not favor banning takeovers but thought
the tender offer process needed reform including earlier
disclosure of takeover attempts.
    N.J. Rep. Mathew Rinaldo, the senior subcommittee
Republican, said he was introducing legislation to create a
five member commission to study the securities industry for a
year and report its findings and recommendations to Congress.
Commission members would be appointed by the SEC.
    "Its primary mission would be to analyze the extent of
illegal trading on insider trading and to assess the adequacy
of existing surveillance systems and government oversight
operations. The commission would advise Congress as to what
additional resources or civil or criminal remedies are needed
to combat fraud and improve compliance with federal laws,"
Rinaldo said.

said its counter proposal to merge with Baker International
Corp was still under consideration and that a merger was in the
best interests of both companies.
    "Our hope is that we can come to a mutual agreement that is
good for both companies," Kistler said of the proposed merger
that would result in a 1.2 billion dlr oil field service
company. "We're working very hard on this merger."
    Hughes' board today again adjourned a shareholders meeting
to vote on the proposed merger and rescheduled it for March 11
to give Baker more time to consider the counter proposal.
    The Hughes board, which had previously expressed concern
about a U.S. Department of Justice consent decree that would
require Baker to sell its drilling bit operations and
submersible pump business, met yesterday and threatened to
terminate the proposed merger.
    The Hughes board made a counter proposal that the two
companies first find acceptable buyers for the businesses
before signing the decree.
    The directors of Baker immediately after receiving the
counter proposal filed a law suit in Texas in a Texas state
court to force to Hughes to complete the merger.
    "The uncertainty as to the price and conditions that might
be imposed by the Department of Justice makes us very nervous
about what the outcome might be," Kistler said, in explaining
why Hughes had made the counter proposal.
    "We need additional time to understand why Baker did not
accept our proposal."
    Kistler also said that the law suit filed by Baker "was not
a factor" in the board's decision to keep its merger proposal
on the table.
    He declined to comment on the allegations in the lawsuit.
    Kistler said Hughes would be willing to consider a
compromise counter proposal, but declined to be more specific.
    The Justice Department in January said it would block the
Hughes and Baker merger on anti-trust grounds unless both
companies agreed to sign a consent decree that would provide
for the sale of the assets after the merger took place.
    The Hughes board said it would not sign the decree because
its was too "unreasonable." Hughes said that Baker should
instead complete the sale of the disputed assets before the
merger is finalized and given government approval.
    Under the decree, if Baker is unable to find acceptable
buyers within a specified period of time after the decree is
approved, a federal trustee would become responsible for
finding a buyer.
    Kistler said that under those terms, the trustee could take
up to 10 years to complete the sales.
    He also expressed concern that the combined companies might
be required by the government's conditions to license some of
its technology to any purchaser of the assets.
    Baker said last night in a statement that the required
assets to be sold would reduce revenues by about 65 mln dlrs,
representing about three pct of the revenues of the combined
companies.

sell to the public its 47.42 pct direct holding in Societe
Generale <STGN.PA>'s regional bank subsidiary <Societe Generale
Alsacienne de Banque>, SOGENAL, from next Monday, SOGENAL
officials said.
    SOGENAL, founded in 1881 and nationalised in 1982, is the
leading French regional bank and has branches in Austria,
Belgium, Luxembourg, East and West Germany and Switzerland.
    Chairman Rene Geronimus told a news conference the share
offer price, expected to be announced tomorrow by Finance
Minister Edouard Balladur, would be between 110 and 130 francs.
    Societe Generale, which will itself be privatised later
this year, will retain its 52.58 pct majority holding in the
bank, Chairman Marc Vienot said.
    SOGENAL officials said they forecast 1987 consolidated
group profit of around 170 mln francs after an estimated 160
mln this year and 159 mln in 1985.
    SOGENAL's privatisation will be preceded by a capital
increase to 320 mln francs from 263 mln, earning about 250 mln
francs in new funds. Its shares will be divided by eight,
giving a capital of 12.8 mln shares of 25 francs nominal.
    The bank will be listed on the Nancy stock exchange, in
line with the Finance Ministry and government's aim of a
regional operation, Geronimus said.
    He said he was hoping for shareholders to total around
30,000 to 35,000 against the 12,500 before nationalisation. Ten
pct of the capital to be floated will be reserved for employees
with the rest offered to the public. There will not be a share
reserved for foreign investors. "This is too small an operation
and anyway they will be able to buy shares in France," he said.
    Stockbroker sources said that a likely share offer price of
120 francs would value SOGENAL at 1.5 billion francs.
    Geronimus said the bank's future aim would be to reinforce
its existing strong points, with no major projects planned
apart from the opening soon of a Basle branch.
    SOGENAL is the only French bank in Austria, it set up the
first foreign exchange dealing room outside Paris at its
Strasbourg headquarters in 1985, and is the only foreign
banking subsidiary to be a broker on the Zurich Bourse.

USAir Group <U> has clouded the fate of Piedmont Aviation Inc,
which was being courted by USAir.
    Yesterday, Icahn's Transworld Airlines Inc <TWA> made a 1.4
billion dlr offer for USAir Group. The move complicated a USAir
takeover offer for Piedmont, which was believed to be close to
accepting the bid.
    Today, USAir rejected Icahn's 52 dlr per share offer and
said the bid was a last-minute effort to interfere in its
takeover of Piedmont. Icahn was unavailable for comment.
    Piedmont fell one to 68-5/8 on volume of 963,000. TWA was
off 3/8 to 31-1/2. USAir fell 1-3/8 to 47-3/4 as doubt spread
it would be taken over.
    Analysts and market sources view the TWA bid as an attempt
to either trigger a counter offer from USAir or to attract a
suitor who might want both airlines once they merged.
   "The next move is either Icahn starts a tender offer or
Piedmont and USAir announce a deal," speculated one arbitrager.
    Some arbitragers said there is now some risk in the current
price of Piedmont since it is not clear that USAir's bid will
succeed.
    Piedmont's largest shareholder and other suitor, Norfolk
Southern Corp <NSC> has offered 65 dlrs per share for the
company. USAir offered 71 dlrs cash per share for half of
Piedmont stock, and 73 dlrs per share in stock for the balance.
    Some arbitragers, however, believe the depressed price of
Piedmont offers a buying opportunity since the airline is
destined to be acquired by someone. USAir, they said, is the
least likely to be bought.
    Icahn, who has long talked about further consolidation in
the airline industry, also offered USAir the alternative of a
three-way airline combination, including TWA and Piedmont.
    But Wall Street has given little credibility to Icahn's
offer, which lacked financing and was riddled with
contingencies.
    Still, he has succeeded in holding up a merger of two
airlines - both of which analysts said would fit well with TWA.
    "You can't discount him," said one arbitrager.
    Analysts, however, said Icahn would have to prove he is
serious by following through with his threats or making a new
offer. In making the offer for USAir, Icahn threatened to go
directly to shareholders for 51 pct of the stock at a lower
price if USAir rejected his offer.
    "It's clear Icahn wants to sell and he's bluffing," said
one arbitrager.
    Analysts said the 52 dlr per share offer was underpriced by
about six dlrs per share.
    Some analysts believe Icahn's proposed three-way airline
combination might face insurmountable regulatory hurdles, but
others believe it could be cleared if the companies are
acquired separately.
    "TWA would have to be the surviving company for the deal to
work," said one analyst.
    Analysts said such a merger would be costly and
complicated. TWA has the best cost structure, since Icahn
succeeded in winning concessions from its unions.
    In order for the other carriers to come down to TWA's wage
scale in a merger, TWA would have to be the surviving entity,
analysts said.
    Such a move does not necessarily free Icahn of TWA, they
said. They said he showed skill in reducing Ozark Airlines'
costs when he merged it into TWA last year, and he might be a
necessary ingredient for a merger to work.
    However, other analysts speculated the managements of
Piedmont and USAir would not tolerate Icahn as head of a new
company. They said a USAir acquisition of TWA might be a way
for him to exit the company if USAir's airline is then merged
into TWA.

Mattson said the company hoped to iron out snags in a proposed
merger with Hughes Tool Co <HT> but declined to say if or what
compromises might be acceptable to it.
    The proposed merger that would create a 1.2 billion dlr
oilfield services company was thrown into limbo yesterday when
Hughes management, balking at the terms of a government consent
decree, offered a counter-proposal to Baker.
    Earlier today, Hughes adjourned a shareholders meeting
called to vote on the proposed merger until March 11 and said
it hoped to resume negotitations with Baker.
    Hughes chairman W.A. Kistler told reporters that Hughes did
not want to sign the Department of Justice consent decree until
after Baker's submersible pump and drilling bit operations were
sold.
    Mattson told Reuters that Baker still believed a merger was
possible between the two giant oilfield service companies.
    "The company's position is we would like to see the merger
be completed, which is in the best interests of our
shareholders and their shareholders," Mattson said.
    "Our goal is for a merger to occur. Because of the
litigation, I can't go any further than that," he said.
    Baker filed a lawsuit in Texas state court late yesterday
to force Hughes to abide by terms of the proposed consent
decree.
    Mattson also declined to comment on whether the directors
of Baker and Hughes have scheduled any meetings to discuss the

Hughes Tool Co into an about-face on its rejection of a
proposed merger with Baker International Corp <BKO>, Wall
Street analysts said.
    Last night, Hughes said the planned merger with Baker was
off. Baker then filed a suit seeking punitive damages from
Hughes for calling off the merger. At midday today Hughes said
it was still interested in the merger.
    The analysts also said Hughes may be worried that its
troubles could make it a takeover candidate.
    There was speculation today that Harold Simmons, the Dallas
investor, might try to acquire Hughes, but Simmons told Reuters
he is not interested.
    Simmons said he intends to file a 13-D with the Securities
and Exchange Monday reporting a stake of five pct or more in
some publicly traded company. He declined to identify the
target other than to rule out Hughes.
    One analyst said another factor in the latest Hughes
turnabout was Borg-Warner Corp <BOR>, which owns 18.5 pct of
Hughes. Borg-Warner ex-chairman J.F. Bere, who serves on the
Hughes board, is believed to favor the merger with Baker.
    Despite the Hughes statement that it is interested in a
merger, and Baker's response that a merger is still possibile,
analysts said no one could be certain where the situation was
going.
    "I think the merger is not going through," said Phil Pace,
analyst at Kidder, Peabody and Co. He said the merger "lost a
lot of its appeal" when the U.S. Department of Justice required
that Baker sell off its Reed Tool Co operation.
    Although the Reed operation is relatively small in view of
the total size of a combined Baker-Hughes, Pace said "30 to 40
pct of the cost savings are tied up in that."
    "They (Hughes) are obviously concerned about the lawsuit,"
said James Crandell, analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc.
"Apparently they are willing to continue discussions but
whether they will alter their position, I don't know.
    "It's getting a little confusing," said James Carroll,
analyst at PaineWebber Group Inc. He said the arguments cited
by Hughes yesterday for not doing the merger "tend to be weak."
Hughes said yesterday that as a condition of the merger it
wanted Reed Tool and other businesses sold prior to April 22,
the projected merger date. A government decree allowed a longer
period of time.
    Hughes contended it was better to formally combine the
companies with the status of Reed already settled. Baker
apparently sees no reason to speed up the sale.
    Carroll said Baker had previously estimated 110 to 130 mln
dlrs in savings if the companies were combined without selling
Reed. But he said Baker now thinks 75 to 85 mln dlrs will be
saved while Hughes sees a saving of only 50 to 60 mln dlrs.
    Carroll also noted that since the merger accord was first
signed "the outlook for the industry has improved materially."
Hughes may simply feel the pressure on the oil service industry
is lifting.

rejected Waste Management Inc's 27 dlr-per-share tender offer
and urged its shareholders not to tender their shares.
    ChemLawn said its board asked management and its financial
advisor, Smith Barney, Harris Upham And Co Inc, to seek other
purchasers of the company to maximize shareholder value.
    ChemLawn also said it adopted a shareholder rights plan, or
"poison pill," during a 120-intermin safeguard period its board
adopted to deter attempts to acquire the company through any
means other than an all-cash tender offer while it seeks other
purchasers.
    ChemLawn also said it began litigation against Waste
Management in federal court in Columbus, seeking injunctive and
other relief.
    The suit alleges, among other things, that certain Waste
Management officers and directors purchased ChemLawn's stock
before making the tender offer. ChemLawn claimed such purchases
possibly violated the officers' fiduciary duties and the
Securities and Exchange Commission's insider trading rules.
    Last week, Waste Management made a tender offer to acquire
ChemLawn for 27 dlrs per share or 270 mln dlrs.
    ChemLawn said its board was determined that Waste's offer
was inadequate and not in the best interest of shareholders,
and could "adversely affect" the interests of its employees,
suppliers, creditors, and customers.
    "Our board carefully reviewed Waste Management offer and
concluded that it does not fully reflect the value of the
company. We strongly urge our shareholders not to tender their
shares to Waste Management," said Chairman L. Jack Van Fossen.
    ChemLawn said its rights plan is designed to protect
shareholders against abusive tactics, such as "market
accumulations by Waste Management or others."
    Under the plan, one comon stock purchase right will be
distributed as a dividend on each outstanding share of ChemLawn
common.
    ChemLawn said its rights holders can buy a share of its
common for one dlr if any entity acquires 25 pct or more of its
commmon, other than by an all cash tender offer for all its
shares or an approved acquisition agreement by its board.
    It said the rights expire July three 1987, or 60 days after
they become exercisable if later than that date. It said its
board may redeem the rights for five cts per right any time
prior to their exercise date.
    ChemLawn said the plan will not be triggered by purchases
purusant to Waste Management's present tender offer.
    It said the dividend will be paid to shareholders of record
March 20.

    The ICC had rejected in July the merger of the Santa Fe and

said it would sell the 4.2 mln B free shares deposited as loan
collateral by Fermenta AB's <FRMS.ST> founder and former chief
executive Refaat el-Sayed and it planned to buy them up itself.
    The bank said the sale - by public auction on March 16 --
was because of a debtor's inability to repay an overdue loan.
    The B free shares closed at 16.50 crowns on the bourse's
unofficial list -- down from a peak of 300 in January 1986.
Nordbanken said it did not exclude accepting a suitable bid for
the shares although it expected to buy them back itself.
    The statement said the sale did not represent any
withdrawal from Nordbanken's undertakings towards the Fermenta
group and that it had been sanctioned by the other main
shareholders.
    Nordbanken is Fermenta's third largest creditor with loans
of 155 mln crowns. It was one of the four Swedish banks which
last month agreed to advance the group 110 mln crowns to solve
its immediate liquidity problems. Together with two other main
shareholders, it also advanced Fermenta an additional 65 mln
crowns until a new equity issue could be made.
    Fermenta is due to hold an extraordinary shareholders'
meeting on Tuesday to approve the planned equity issue.
    Nordbanken had to make a provision against a 200 mln crown
loan to el-Sayed in its 1986 results.
    Fermenta's new management originally hoped to raise 160 mln
crowns through the new one for four rights issue and an extra
170 mln from an issue to Nordbanken, another major creditor and
shareholder <Gotabanken> and the group's new majority owner
<Industrivarden AB>.
    The share price was to be 20 crowns. But there has been
doubt over the plans since the stock fell below this level this
week after Fermenta's former chairman Kjell Brandstrom said the
company was in a much worse state than he thought.

investor Asher Edelman agreed on a settlement that prohibits
Edelman and his group from taking specified actions to obtain
control of the company and that limits the Edelman group's
ownership of Lucky's stock to less than five pct of any voting
securities.
    The arrangement also provides for the dismissal of pending
litigation between the parties, Lucky Stores said.
    The settlement also calls for the withdrawal of Edelman's
motion to intervene in pending shareholder actions against
Lucky Stores and its directors, the company said.
    In addition, the standstill provisions also apply to
Hancock Fabrics after it is spun off to Lucky stockholders, the
company said.
    Lucky Stores said the arrangement also calls for the
company to submit to stockholders at a special meeting set for
December 31 a proposal from Edelman seeking their views
concerning repeal of a charter provision that limits the voting
power of substantial Lucky stockholders.
    Edelman, who owns about five pct of Lucky Stores' stock,
last year was rebuffed in his effort to acquire the company.
    Last October Lucky Stores implimented a restructuring
program that included the repurchase of 28 pct of its own
common shares and reincorporation in Delaware.
    The spinoff of Hancock Textile Co, a chain of 324 retail
stores, was one of the key parts of the restructuring program.
    Edelman and his Plaza Securities Co partnership
subsequently sued in an attempt to block the proposed
reincorporation, which was a condition of the repurchase and
restructuring plan.

investor George Soros said it was dissatisfied with Fairchild
Industries Inc management and was considering boosting its
holdings to as much as 49.9 pct of the aerospace and aviation
company's outstanding stock.
    The group already controls 1,647,481 Fairchild Industries
shares or 11.5 pct of the total outstanding.
    The group said it filed on Wednesday with federal antitrust
regulators for advance clearance to buy enough additional
shares to increase its total stake to up to 49.9 pct of the
total outstanding stock.
    The group said its representatives had met with Fairchild
Industries officials to inform them "that they do not believe
management has been successful in enhancing or protecting
shareholder values."
    It said it was considering the additional share purchases
to enable it to "assert a greater degree of influence over the
future management and policies of the issuer."
    It said a decision on the specific level of share ownership
it would seek depended on market prices, future changes in
management policies, available financial resources and other
factors.
    The group said it also reserved the right to pursue other
measures intended to influence Fairchild management and
policies, either alone or in concert with other investors.
    The group includes Soros and Quantum Fund, an offshore
investment firm headquartered in Curacao, Netherlands Antilles
that is advised by Soros.
    The group said that since its last SEC filing, made Jan. 2,
it had purchased no additional Fairchild shares and had sold
6,700 shares on the New York Stock Exchange Jan. 19.

the company he was not dissatisfied with its management.

    However, Fulwider said the company would have nothing to

from one of its largest creditors, <Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce>, to sell its 42 pct stake in <Encor Energy Corp Ltd>,
energy industry analysts said.
    Dome has pledged its 42.5 mln Encor shares as security for
part of its debt to Commerce Bank, estimated last year at 947
mln Canadian dlrs, and the bank wants Dome to sell the stock to
pay down debt, analysts said.
    "The Commerce has been slowly but surely moving Encor in the
direction that might make it a saleable asset," said one analyst
who asked not to be named.
    Dome earlier said it was not considering selling Encor
Energy, but reaffirmed the company's 23.3 pct interest in
Canadian gold producer Dome Mines Ltd <DM> is up for sale "at
the right price."
    Dome, now negotiating a plan to restructure more than 6.10
billion dlrs in debt, sees Encor as a strategic investment that
it does not intend to sell, spokesman David Annesley said. The
Encor shares do not pay dividends.
    A Commerce Bank spokesman also declined comment when asked
whether it is pressing Dome to sell its Encor stake.
    At current market prices, Dome's stake in Encor would be
valued at about 308 mln dlrs, while its 20.9 mln Dome Mines
shares would be worth about 319 mln dlrs.
    Recent strength in the price of Encor shares may also
prompt Commerce Bank to press Dome to divest its holding in the
Canadian oil and gas producer, analysts said.
    "Encor's stock price has improved quite substantially in
recent weeks with a runup in crude prices," Peters and Co Ltd
oil analyst Wilf Gobert commented.
    "The possibility is that Commerce Bank would like to see it
sold at these levels because they can get more for it now than
they have been able to in recent years," he added.
    Encor traded earlier on the Toronto Stock Exchange at
7-1/8, near its 52-week high of 7-1/2 and up from around six
dlrs in early February.
    The company also recently set up its own operating
management, which was previously carried out by Dome Petroleum,
Maison Placements Canada Inc analyst Denis Mote commented.
    Dome and Encor "are actually going to get farther apart. So
(the sale) does make a lot of sense," Mote said.
    However, analysts said Dome will resist any moves to divest
Encor in favor of retaining the operating assets since sale
proceeds would likely go directly to pay down Dome's debt to
Commerce Bank.
    "I think they'll probably try to hang onto Encor as long as
they can," said Bache Securities Inc analyst Doug Weber.
    Some of Dome's group of 56 major creditors might move to
block such a sale, arguing they have a claim on company assets.
    "Other creditors generally all want to make sure that
something they might be able to get a piece of is not being
sold out from under them," said analyst Gobert.
    Another stumbling block would be Encor's 225 mln dlr joint
liability in loans to Dome Petroleum advanced by Arctic
Petroleum Corp of Japan for Beaufort Sea exploration.
    Analysts said a similar hurdle could also hinder the
possible sale of Dome Petroleum's interest in Dome Mines.
    Dome Mines has guaranteed 225 mln dlrs of Dome Petroleum's
debt and has a "right of consent" to the sale of Dome Petroleum's
holding.
    Presumably, a potential buyer of the Dome Mines shares
would seek some type of relief on the company's debt
obligations connected with Dome Petroleum, Gobert said.
    Dome spokesman Annesley earlier declined to specify at what
price the company would consider selling its Dome Mines shares,
but said current prices of more than 15 dlrs a share "are very
attractive."

(DOT) said it dismissed on technical grounds an application by
Trans World Airlines Inc for DOT approval for it to take
control of USAir Group.
    The DOT added, however, that TWA was free to refile when it
could put together an application for control that met the
agency's procedural requirements.
    The DOT acted shortly after the U.S. Department of Justice
disclosed that it supported dismissal of the TWA application.
    It was not immediately clear what impact the denial would
have on TWA's bid to take over USAir.
    In its control application, TWA had acknowledged that
additional documentation was required to meet DOT rules and
said it would file more material on the morning of March 9.
    But the DOT said it would not wait.
    "We have determined to dismiss TWA's application for
approval of the acquisition of USAir," it said in an order
issued late Friday.
    "TWA's application clearly fails to comply with the filing
requirements of our regulations...and TWA has provided no
reason why we should accept such a deficient filing," it added.
    "Accordingly, we will dismiss the application. TWA, of
course, may refile it when it is able to comply with our
procedural rules," the DOT said.
    The agency added that it would continue to consider a
separate TWA request for federal clearance to purchase USAir
stock through a voting trust.
    USAir had said earlier today that it asked the DOT to
dismiss the TWA control application, on grounds the TWA filing
did not meet DOT requirements.

    Bank Negara said it subsequently took up the unsubscribed

    It said the shares, held in trust, will be eventually sold.

Inc has agreed to be acquired for 69 dlrs per share.
    The company, in a newspaper advertisement, said it has
started a tender offer for all Piedmont shares at that price,
and the Piedmont board, with two directors absent, has
unanimously approved the bid.  The offer and withdrawal rights
are to expire April Three unless extended, and the bid is to be
followed by a merger at the same price.
    USAir said Piedmont has granted it an irrevocable option to
buy up to 3,491,030 new shares under certain circumstances.
Piedmont now has about 18.6 mln shares outstanding.
    USAir said the tender is conditioned on receipt of enough
shares to give USAir at least a 50.1 pct interest in Piedmont
on a fully diluted basis and approval by the U.S. Department of
Transportation of a voting trust agreement permitting USAir to
buy and hold shares pending review of its application to gain
control of Piedmont.
    The company said its merger agreement with Piedmont
provides that the offer is not to be amended without Piedmont's
prior written consent in any way that would be adverse to
Piedmont shareholders, but it said it could cut the number of
shares to be bought without Piedmont's consent.
    USAir said it could reduce the number of Piedmont shares to
be purchased in the offer to no less than the minimum number
needed to cause the voting trust condition of the bid to be
satisfied.
    In that case, it said if more than that minimum number of
shares were tendered, it would buy shares on a pro rata basis.
    In February USAir had offered to pay 71 dlrs per share in
cash for 50 pct of Piedmont's stock and 1.55 to 1.90 USAir
shares for each remaining Piedmont share.
    Last week, Carl C. Icahn-controlled Trans World Airlines
Inc <TWA> made a conditional offer to acquire USAir for 52 dlrs
per share, a bid that was rejected by the USAir board.
    The Transportation Department on Friday rejected TWA's
application to acquire USAir on the grounds that the
application failed to comply with department regulations by
omitting necessary information.  TWA said it would refile
today, providing the information needed.
    On Friday TWA said it had already acquired four mln shares
or 15 pct of USAir.

formed by Martin T. Sosnoff, said it has started a tender offer
for all shares of Caesars World Inc at 28 dlrs each.
    In a newspaper advertisement, MTS said the offer and
withdrawal rights expire April Three unless extended.
    Sosnoff, a New York investor, already owns about four mln
of Caesars' 30.3 mln shares outstanding, or about 13.3 pct, and
is Caesars' largest shareholder.  Caesars owns casino hotels in
Nevada and honeymoon resorts in Pennsylvania's Pocono
Mountains.  It also controls Caesars New Jersey Inc <CJN>,
which owns an Atlantic City, N.J., casino hotel.
    For the second quarter ended January 31, Caesars World
earned 12.6 mln dlrs on revenues of 190.4 mln dlrs, up from
earnings of 7,500,000 dlrs and revenues of 163.8 mln dlrs a
year before.  For all of fiscal 1986, the company earned 41.0
mln dlrs on revenues of 694.4 mln dlrs.
    MTS said the offer is conditioned on receipt of at least
enough shares to give Sosnoff a majority interest on a fully
diluted basis, the arrangement of sufficient financing to buy
all Caesars shares not already owned and pay related costs and
approval by the New Jersey Casino control Commission and the
NEvada Gaming Commission and State Gaming Control Board.
    MTS said Marine Midland Banks Inc <MM> has committed to
lend it 100 mln dlrs for the acquisition and use its best
efforts to syndicate another 400 mln dlrs in senior financing
for the transaction.
    It said its financial adviser, PaineWebber Group Inc <PWJ>,
has stated in writing that subject to market conditions, it is
highly confident that it can arrange commitments for up to 475
mln dlrs in "mezzanine" financing.
    MTS said it does not expect problems in obtaining New
Jersey and Nevada regulatory approval for the acquisition,
since ownership in a Caesars stake has already been cleared.
    In June 1986, Sosnoff requested a seat on the Caesars World
board, a request that has not yet been granted.  In September
1986, Sosnoff, who is chairman of <Atalanta/Sosnoff Capital
Corp>, filed for clearance under U.S. antitrust laws to raise
his interest in Caesars World to 25 pct.
    Sosnoff said, in a letter to Caesars World chairman and
chief executive officer Henry Gluck, that "The decision to go
directly to the shareholders was made at the urging of may
financial and legal advisors, who repeatedly stressed to me the
lack of responsiveness of the management in the past."
    Sosnoff, who said he has made numerous efforts to express
his views to management on ways of maximizing shareholder
values, said Caesars twicce refused his request for a board
seat.  "My advisers felt that, had I given you advance notice,
you would have used the time to throw up obstacles to my offer
rather than giving it serious consideration," he said.
    Sosnoff said he hopes that Caesars World management will be
willing to negotiate an acquisition agreement with him.
    "As I have indicated publicly in the past, I believe
operating management of the company has performed well and that
appropriate consideration should be given to a significant
equity interest for them in the company following the
acquisition," Sosnoff said in the letter to Gluck.
    MTS said Sosnoff has asked the company to fix March 27 as
the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled
to authorize action without a meeting -- including the election
or removal of directors.

side 30 days to put together a definitive accord. Approval
would also be necessary from the Renault, Chrysler and AMC

28-dlr-per-share offering price for Caesars World Inc is

    "I think someone else will probably come in, or they (MTS)
will have to raise their bid," said Marvin Roffman, an analyst
at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc.
    MTS, a company formed by Martin Sosnoff, Caesars World's
largest shareholder, today began a tender offer, valued at
725.2 mln dlrs, for all shares Sosnoff doesn't already own.
    "I think the offer is too low by at least five points,"
said Roffman, who described Caesars World as the operator of
"one of the finest casinos in the world."
    Sosnoff, a New York investor, already owns 13.3 pct of
Caesars World's 30.3 mln shares.
    Following news of the tender offer Caesars World's shares
were trading at 27-7/8, up 3-3/8.

comment on the Sosnoff move for the moment, but Caesars may
issue a public statement after it has studied the offer.
    Roffman said Caesars World has considerable growth
potential and he is forecasting fiscal 1988 earnings of two
dlrs per share.
    Caesars World owns casino hotels in Nevada and honeymoon
resorts in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains. It also controls

dlrs, or 25 cts per share a year earlier.
    Daniel Lee, an analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc, said
that although Sosnoff's relatively low bid may attract other
suitors willing to pay a higher price for Caesars, there is
little likelihood that a competing bid would start a battle for
the company.

Far Hills, N.J., investor Natalie Koether said it is seeking
information about the shareholders of Prime Medical Services
Inc, over which it has said it is seeking control.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
the group, which includes Shamrock Associates, included a March
6 letter to Prime which asks for a complete list of all
shareholders and their addresses.
    The group said it wants the information so it can contact
shareholders on issues, including election of an opposition
slate of directors to the board and other proxy contests.
    The Koether group's letter gives the company five days to
respond to its request. If there is no response from Prime
Medical, the group said it would consider the demand refused
and would take "other proper steps" to get the information.
    The group said it already holds 1,483,886 Prime Medical
shares, or 17.5 pct of the total. It said it has taken legal
action to try to force the company to set an annual meeting and
require all directors to stand for election.
    In a previous SEC filing, the group has said it has decided
to try to seek control of Prime Medical through a tender offer,
exchange offer, proxy contest or other ways.

American Motors Corp is valued at about 1.55 billion dlrs,
including the cost of acquisition and the 767 mln dlrs in
American Motor' debt that Chrysler will assume, analysts said.
    They said Chrysler's cost of acquisition was valued at  782
mln dlrs, paid in cash, notes and Chrysler shares.
    The analysts told Reuters that at a New York briefing
Chrysler treasurer Fred Zuckerman outlined his company's
agreement with Renault to assume AMC's debt as well as 332 mln
dlrs in unfunded pension liabilities, though the latter is not
included valuing the transaction.
    Analysts were generally positive on Chrysler's proposed
purchase of its much-smaller rival, but said they expected the
transaction would carry with it a short-term dilution in
Chrysler's earnings.
    A Chrysler financial source, speaking anonymously, told
Reuters that the proposed purchase price was smaller than it
would have been had a deal been struck last year because the
impact of the new U.S. tax law removes Chrysler's ability to
assume AMC's large reserve of tax-loss carryforwards
accumulated from its losses since 1980.
    "There were very serious discussions last fall but we
didn't pull it off," the source said in a reference to the
assassination in November of former Renault chairman Georges
Besse.
    "It's too bad because the tax benefits fell on the floor.
And Renault could have gotten a much better price if we'd done
it before the end of last year."
    In addition to AMC's debt and its pension liabilities, the
source said Chrysler would also assume any liability from
lawsuits over the safety of Jeeps, which he called "an overhang
to the company."
    Analysts quoted Chrysler officials as having told them that
the deal includes payment to Renault of 200 mln dlrs principal
in the form of a 10-year note at eight pct interest, 35 mln
dlrs cash for Renault's equity in AMC's finance subsidiary, 25
mln dlrs in cash for "transaction fees" in connection with the
acquisition and 522 mln dlrs worth of Chrysler stock to be paid
AMC shareholders.
    "The big number is the 767 mln dlrs in debt assumption,"
analyst Jack Kirnan of Kidder Peabody and Co told Reuters.
     Moody's Investors Service Inc said it may downgrade 12
billion dlrs of Chrysler Corp and unit debt due to the deal.
     But the Chrysler source said that in assuming AMC's
liabilities, his company will refinance at a lower rate any AMC
debt that is being carried at "non-market" rates.
    He said there were difficulties in negotiating with the
previous Renault management on the acquisition because they
were committed to the group's business plan of which AMC was an
integral part.
    "The new management didn't have that problem - AMC wasn't
their baby," he said.

takeover American Motors Corp <AMO> should help bolster the
small automaker's sales, but it leaves the future of its 19,000
employees in doubt, industry analysts say.
    It was "business as usual" yesterday at the American Motors
headquarters, one day after the proposed merger was unveiled by
Chrysler and AMC's French parent Renault, according to company
spokesman Edd Snyder.
    But AMC's future, to be discussed at a board meeting today,
would be radically different as a Chrysler subsidiary than if
it had continued with the state-run French car group as its
controlling shareholder.
    Industry analysts said the future of AMC's car assembly
plant in Kenosha, Wis., and its Toledo, Ohio, Jeep plant would
be in doubt if the overcapacity predicted in the North American
auto industry by the early 1990s comes to pass.
    Both plants are far from "state of the art" for car
manufacturing sites, and AMC has a history of poor labor
relations at each.
    "Chrysler doesn't need that many new plants," said Michael
Luckey, automotive analyst for the Wall Street firm Shearson
Lehman Brothers. "They probably will close the Toledo plant and
move Jeep production to Canada."
    Ronald Glantz of Montgomery Securities said that at the
very least, the new owner of the Toledo plant would be able to
wring concessions from the United Automobile Workers union
local representing Jeep workers.
    "The UAW won't be able to hold them up for ransom as they
have AMC because during a down year, Chrysler will have
underutilized facilities to transfer production," he said.
    Analysts said they foresaw no major complications that
would abort a combination which historians said would be the
auto industry's biggest merger since American Motors was formed
in 1954.
    AMC was in need of a financial savior because of its losses
of more than 800 mln dlrs since 1980 and pressures in France
for Renault to cut its backing. The company had said it could
not forecast consistent profitability until 1988 at the
earliest.
    In announcing the takeover agreement, Chrysler chairman Lee
Iacocca cited AMC's Jeep division as well as its new 675 mln
dlr assembly plant at Bramalea, Ontario, and its network of
1,200 dealers as the major attractions.
    Analysts reasoned that Chrysler might feel moved eventually
to sell off or close some of the older plants to cut overhead
costs in view of the new debts and liabilities it would incur
in the AMC buyout.

saw some benefit in the proposed purchase of American Motors Co
<AMO> By Chrysler Corp <C> in that it would return the smallest
of the U.S. auto manufacturers to American hands.
    Meese told the House Appropriations Subcommittee that
consideration would be part of the Justice Department's review

a formal notice of the merger which would start the review
process.
   Chrysler has made a 1.3 billion dlr bid to buy AMC from its
French parent Renault.
    "I think one of the things that has to be recognized in that
merger is that it appears, at least, that a good portion of the
ownership of American Motors, which has been in overseas hands
will be put back in American hands," Meese told the

    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,

been rumored to be a takeover candidate, rose sharply today
when speculation surfaced that investor T. Boone Pickens may be
targeting the company for an acquisition, traders and analysts
said.
    Tenneco spokesman Joseph Macrum said "we have no comment to
make whatsoever." Pickens was not available for comment.
    Traders noted that activity in the stock increased today
after a published report linked Pickens to Tenneco.
    Tenneco rose two points to 48-3/4.
    Paul Feretti, an analyst with New Orleans-based Howard,
Weil, Labouisse, Friedrichs, Inc, said he was not surprised at
market rumors that Tenneco might be the target of a takeover
attempt.
    "It's pure market speculation that Boone Pickens and his
group may be interested," Feretti said.
    "But Tenneco would be a challenge to run because of its
sheer size and diversity. Mr. Pickens is a man who likes a
challenge."
    Pickens, who made an unsuccessful attempt to take over
Dallas-based Diamond Shamrock Corp <DIA> last winter, has made
no secret of his plans to acquire additional natural gas
reserves in the belief that gas prices will stabilize sooner
than oil prices. Tenneco holds natural gas reserves estimated
in excess of 3.5 trillion cubic feet, analysts said.
    Feretti conservatively estimated Tenneco's breakup value at
58 dlrs a share and said the company generated a cash flow of
about 10 dlrs a share "which is probably very attractive to
Pickens." Other analysts, however, estimate a breakup value
well into the 60 dlr a share range.
    "I strongly doubt that there is going to be any hostile
takeover," Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc's Houston-based analyst
John Olson said, putting little credence in the rumors.
    "Tenneco is a gargantuan enterprise with seven billion dlrs
in long-term debt and preferred stock outstanding." He said the
buyer would also have to deal with "the intractable problems"
Tenneco faces with its farm equipment unit and energy
businesses.
    Analysts suggested that Tenneco could use a number of
defensive strategies to fend off an unwanted buyer, such as
spin off some of its non-energy businesses directly to
shareholders, buy back shares or create a limited partnership
out of its natural gas pipeline interests.
    An analyst who asked to remain unidentified, discouraged
the Pickens rumor. "Pickens has a plateful already with his
holdings in Burlington Northern and Amerada Hess," he said. "I
don't think he would be willing to take on Tenneco's problems
with Case (the farm equipment unit), which has been losing
about 180 mln dlrs annually and is worth less than a billion
dlrs on the market today."

Co shareholders approved a merger agreement with Baker
International Corp based on revised terms that allow the
companies additional time to sell a drilling bit business as
required by the U.S. Justice Department.
     Hughes chairman William Kistler said the revised terms of
the proposed consent decree also set a 10 mln dlr cap on how
much funding the newly combined companies will have to spend on
the disputed drilling bit business until it is sold.
    An earlier proposed consent decree did not establish a
funding limit.
    The Baker-Hughes merger, which would would create a 1.2
billion dlr oilfield services company, almost fell through
earlier this month when Hughes balked at terms of a proposed
Justice Department consent decree that would have given the
companies only three months to find a buyer for the Reed
business.
    Baker said today it would withdraw the one billion dlr
lawsuit it had filed to force Hughes to follow through with the
merger.
    Hughes' Kistler, speaking to reporters after 85 pct of
Hughes' shareholders approved the merger, said the revised
terms of the agreement give the companies six months to find a
buyer for the Reed drilling bit business. The previous
agreement had proposed a three-month period.
    Kistler said the the government had also indicated it would
consider granting, if necessary, an additional three-month
extension to complete the sale.
    He said there were "several people looking" at the domestic
drilling bit business.
    The companies, Kistler said, have also decided to
voluntarily sell a Reed plant in Singapore.
    Kistler estimated that the merger, which should be
completed in about two weeks, will result in annual cost
savings of about 50 mln dlrs. He said he expects "substantial
cutbacks" in the 20,000-member workforce at Baker-Hughes Inc,
the name the merged company will take.
    Kistler said the cost savings and greater efficiencies
should put the company on a profitable course. "We think that
in the third or fourth quarter after the merger we should see
something close to breakeven," he said.
    In the fourth quarter of 1986, Hughes earned 31.7 mln dlrs
on sales of 215.7 mln dlrs.

introduction of rules to shield companies from hostile takeover
attempts, its governor, Robin Leigh-Pemberton, said.
    Instead, merchant banks advising bidding companies must
show restraint and responsibility to avoid the excesses that
have marred recent takeovers, he told the Yorkshire and
Humberside Regional Confederation of British Industries' annual
dinner.
    Leigh-Pemberton also called on companies to improve ties
with institutional investors, suggesting representatives of
those institutions be granted seats on the boards of directors
of companies they invest in.
    "Boards cannot expect protection from unwelcome predators,
for that is but a short step from saying that they should be
protected from their own shareholders -- who are, after all,
the proprietors of the company," Leigh-Pemberton said.
    He added takeovers and mergers had an important role to
play in furthering economies of scale, integration and more
efficient market penetration. "The degree of success or failure
(of a takeover) has not in my experience depended on whether or
not the takeover was contested," he said.
    Leigh-Pemberton noted there had been excesses in takeover
activity in the recent past. "The aim is to pressurise a
company's management into action dedicated solely to a
favourable impact on the share price in the short-term, partly
or even primarily at the expense of the future," he said.
    Such bids "often depend for their success on creating a
highly-charged and artificial situation in the share market,
and give rise to temptations, on both sides of the battle, to
engage in aggressive, even manipulative tactics that are
immensely damaging to the interest of the shareholders," he
said.
    In a clear reference recent events, he said "those in the
City who act for companies or individuals .. Must, I suggest,
be ready to accept a full measure of responsibility -- even if
it entails opprobrium -- for the transactions that may result."
    They "should exercise the most careful judgment at the
outset with respect to the clients for whom they act and the
activities contenplated. Those who sow wind cannot expect the
whirlwind to visit elsewhere," he added.

introduction of rules to shield companies from hostile takeover
attempts, its governor, Robin Leigh-Pemberton, said.
    Instead, merchant banks advising bidding companies must
show restraint and responsibility to avoid the excesses that
have marred recent takeovers, he told the Yorkshire and
Humberside Regional Confederation of British Industries' annual
dinner.
    Leigh-Pemberton also called on companies to improve ties
with institutional investors, suggesting representatives of
those institutions be granted seats on the boards of directors
of companies they invest in.
    "Boards cannot expect protection from unwelcome predators,
for that is but a short step from saying that they should be
protected from their own shareholders -- who are, after all,
the proprietors of the company," Leigh-Pemberton said.
    He added takeovers and mergers had an important role to
play in furthering economies of scale, integration and more
efficient market penetration. "The degree of success or failure
(of a takeover) has not in my experience depended on whether or
not the takeover was contested," he said.
    Leigh-Pemberton noted there had been excesses in takeover
activity in the recent past. "The aim is to pressurise a
company's management into action dedicated solely to a
favourable impact on the share price in the short-term, partly
or even primarily at the expense of the future," he said.
    Such bids "often depend for their success on creating a
highly-charged and artificial situation in the share market,
and give rise to temptations, on both sides of the battle, to
engage in aggressive, even manipulative tactics that are
immensely damaging to the interest of the shareholders," he
said.
    In a clear reference recent events, he said "those in the
City who act for companies or individuals .. Must, I suggest,
be ready to accept a full measure of responsibility -- even if
it entails opprobrium -- for the transactions that may result."
    They "should exercise the most careful judgment at the
outset with respect to the clients for whom they act and the
activities contenplated. Those who sow wind cannot expect the
whirlwind to visit elsewhere," he added.

products.
    Cyacq includes Audio/Video Affiliates Inc and Citicorp

    Additionally, Dixon Group's rights to buy Cyclops common

450 mln dlrs in revenues. It's a very large company and it's
being sold for 50 or 60 mln dlrs," said Gardner in a telephone
interview with Reuters.
    Gardner is an official of Kelso Management, a firm
associated with Fidelity International Ltd. A group of Fidelity
companies owns eight pct of Purolator, and Gardner said he
personally owns 20,000 shares.
    A Purolator official said the company has no comment on the
letter from Gardner.
    Arbitragers speculated another overnight messenger service
may emerge as a likely bidder for Purolator. Before the
transaction with Hutton LBO was announced, analysts had also
speculated another courier company would be the most likely
suitor.
    While one arbitrager acknowledged there in fact may be no
new bidders, he said the possibility one could appear pushed
the stock into play again.
    "There's no shortage of possibilities. It's just a question
of management's willingness to let the process continue," said
one arbitrager.
    Arbitragers said a new buyer might be found because they
believe Hutton LBO has taken on no risk in the transaction.
Hutton has begun a tender for 83 pct of Purolator at 35 dlrs
cash per share. The balance of Purolator's stock will be bought
for securities and warrants in a new company holding the U.S.
courier operations.
    The arbitragers said tender offer documents show that
Hutton does not need to use its cash in the transaction and
will emerge with a giant, majority equity interest in
Purolator.
    "As far as I can tell from the public documents from the
deal that's on the table, Hutton is basically putting up zero.
One always likes a situation like that. You always like to
think if they can do this deal at no risk, there should be
someone else in the world that could do it higher," said one
arbitrager.
    The firm, however, is supplying temporary financing, and
sources close to the transaction disputed the claim that the
firm will not end up paying for its equity position.
    While one scenario mentioned in the tender offer document
did note that the E.F. Hutton Group subsidiary may not have to
keep cash in the transaction, the sources said there is some
risk to the firm.
    "There are a variety of contingencies and restricted cash,
and all sorts of things that make it very speculative," said
one of the sources, adding there are also severance payments to
employees.
    The E.F. Hutton Group subsidiary is supplying 279 mln dlrs
in so-called "bridge" financing for the transaction. The bridge
financing is a temporary loan from Hutton.
    The financing is to be replaced with permanent financing,
expected to come from banks. However, it may take some time to
replace the financing, the source said, resulting in what could
be a substantial expense to the firm.
    Gardner said Hutton stands to gain fees of 10 to 20 mln
dlrs from the transaction, but sources close to the transaction
said fees are at the low end of the scale.
    "It's a very complex transaction, but basically what
happens is they ostensibly put up money but the fees recapture
any investment they might have once the merger takes place,"
Gardner said.

Reichmann brothers are working well together as partners and
currently do not plan any change in their joint ownership of
distiller Hiram Walker-Gooderham and Worts, Allied-Lyons
chairman Derrick Holden-Brown said.
    Allied-Lyons got 51 pct control of Hiram Walker-Gooderham
last year for about 600 mln U.S. dlrs, while the Reichmanns'
<Gulf Canada Corp> acquired 49 pct in an out-of-court pact
after a hostile battle for the wine and spirits division of
<Hiram Walker Resources Ltd>.
    "We are getting along very well as partners ... I hope
there won't be any change, but there could be," Holden-Brown
told reporters after a speech in Toronto.
    He said Allied-Lyons has a two-year call option that could
force Gulf Canada to sell its 49 pct stake to Allied-Lyons, and
Gulf Canada has a two-year put option that could obligate
Allied-Lyons to buy its 49 pct.
    "Both we and Gulf hope very much there will be no occasion
for either the put or call to be exercised," Holden-Brown said.
    In answer to a reporter's question, Holden-Brown said it
would be possible for Gulf Canada to sell off part of its 49
pct in a public offering with Allied-Lyons' consent. "I don't
think we would have any objection to it," he added.
    Allied-Lyons maintains control of Hiram Walker-Gooderham's
board of directors and has total responsibility for its
management. "We cannot contemplate giving up our control," he
said.
    Holden-Brown would not disclose how big a profit
contribution the distiller will make in Allied-Lyons' financial
results, but he said "it will be substantial."
    "I am not able to give profit forecasts," he said.
    Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons was able to finance the
Hiram Walker-Gooderham acquisition with cash and borrowings,
and has no current plans for a stock issue.
    He said the company is not currently negotiating any more
acquisitions in Canada but has a team of officials evaluating
possible purchases of wines, spirits, soft drinks or food
concerns. "I don't think we shall be looking at the brewery
scene (which is) highly concentrated already," he added.

Canadian stock exchanges, possibly later this year.

arguments made by senior U.S. Government officials seeking to
block the sale of a U.S. Microchip maker to a Japanese firm.
    "They appear to be linking completely unrelated issues,"
Shuichi Takemoto of the Foreign Ministry's North American
Division told Reuters.
    U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige has asked the
White House to consider blocking the sale of <Fairchild
Semiconductor Corp> to Japan's Fujitsu Ltd <ITSU.T>, U.S.
Officials said yesterday.
    Baldrige expressed concern that the sale would leave the
U.S. Military dependent on a foreign company for vital high
technology equipment. Pentagon officials said Defence Secretary
Caspar Weinberger also opposes to the sale.
    U.S. Officials have also said the sale would give Fujitsu a
powerful role in the U.S. Market for supercomputers while
Japan's supercomputer market remains closed to U.S. Sales.
    Takemoto said national security should not be an issue
since the planned purchase of Fairchild from its current owner,
Schlumberger Ltd <SLB>, does not include Fairchild's main
defence-related division.
    In addition, Takemoto said tension over the supercomputer
trade should not affect the sale as Fairchild does not make
supercomputers.
    Analysts noted that Fairchild does make sophisticated
microchips used in supercomputers. Fujitsu makes similar chips
and supplies them to U.S. Supercomputer makers, they said.
    Takemoto also dismissed U.S. Fears that the proposed
takeover would violate U.S. Antitrust law, saying "the purchase
would not result in Fujitsu monopolising the U.S. Semiconductor
market."
    Two separate issues appear to have come together to boost
pressure to block the purchase, industry analysts said.
    The move is in part an attempt to force Japan to open its
domestic market to more U.S. Supercomputer sales, they said.
    U.S. Officials have repeatedly charged that the Japanese
public sector is closed to U.S. Supercomputer sales despite
U.S. Firms' technological lead in the field.
    "The United States believes Japan will only react when
bullied, and this is a bullying ploy," Salomon Brothers Asia
analyst Carole Ryavec said.
    However, the analysts said more is at stake than
supercomputer sales as the U.S. Fears it is losing its vital
semiconductor industry to Japanese competitors.
    "The real issue is xenophobia in (the U.S.) Silicon Valley,"
said Tom Murtha of brokerage James Capel and Co.
    U.S.-Japanese tension over the semiconductor trade has
failed to subside despite recent efforts by Japan's Ministry of
International Trade and Industry (MITI) to get Japanese firms
to abide by a bilateral pact aimed at halting predatory pricing
and opening Japan's market.
    A MITI official said that while Japan is faithfully abiding
by the agreement, problems remain in halting the sale of
microchips in Europe and Southeast Asia at prices below those
set by the pact.
    "It is only a matter of time before we solve this problem,"
he told Reuters.
    Despite the furore, Fujitsu will proceed with talks on the
acquisition in line with the basic agreement reached with
Schlumberger last year, a Fujitsu spokeswoman told Reuters.

and would use the proceeds to pay off debt.
    In addition to the possible sale of the amusement parks,
Bally plans to sell a minority stake in its health club chain
to the public. The company will register a proposed offering
with the Securities and Exchange Commission for 20 to 30 pct of
the health clubs soon, spokesman William Peltier told Reuters.
    "Selling Six Flags is definitely under consideration,"
Peltier said in response to an inquiry. He said the company
would use much of the income from the amusement park chain,
were it to be sold, to repay debt.
    Six Flags might sell for as much as 300 mln dlrs, analysts
said. The health club chain, the nation's largest, is valued at
350 to 375 mln dlrs, they said.
    Bally reportedly already has been approached about Six
Flags by several prospective buyers.
    The company needs the cash to begin paying back a 1.6 mln
dlrs mountain of debt.
    Bally recently completed a 439 mln dlrs acquisition of the
Golden Nugget casino hotel in Atlantic City from Golden Nugget
Inc <GNG.N>.
    The purchase pushed its long-term debt to 1.6 billion dlrs,
or almost 2.7 times its equity of 600 mln dlrs.
    Bally's 325-unit health and tennis clubs had revenues in
1986 of more than 450 mln dlrs, or about 28 pct of Bally's
total revenues of 1.64 billion dlrs.
    Bally acquired Six Flags for 147.4 mln dlrs in January 1982
from Penn Central Corp. Bally bought the Great America theme
park in Gurnee, Ill., in May 1984 for 113.2 mln dlrs from
Marriott Corp <mhs>.
    In 1986 the parks had pretax operating profit of 48.6 mln
dlrs on revenues of 369.4 mln dlrs.
    The clubs and equipment unit combined to post operating
profit of 60.4 mln dlrs on revenues of 475.6 mln dlrs in 1986,
of which 456.2 mln came from the clubs.
    The company earlier this month said it will take a charge
to earnings in the first quarter of 17.3 mln dlrs as a result
of its deal to buy back 2.6 mln of its common shares from real
estate developer Donald Trump.
    Under a February 21 deal, Bally agreed to buy the 2.6 mln
of the 3.06 mln shares held by Trump at 24 dlrs a share, or
62.4 mln dlrs, plus 6.2 mln dlrs related expenses in exchange
for Trump not seeking control of the company for 10 years.
    The deal also requires Bally to buy Trump's remaining
shares for 33 dlrs a share if the stock price does not reach
that level by February 21, 1988.

    The conditions were that Cyclops provide Cyacq with

with financial projections made by Dixons in its offer.
    Cyclops also said its board determined that Cyacq's
announcement was not an offer. "Cyacq's press release does not
amend Cyacq's outstanding tender offer which remains at 80 dlrs
per share and it does not state that Cyacq has financing

    Its agreements with Dixons are binding and Dixons indicated
it will not rescind or waive any provisions of the pacts,
Cyclops said.

company to meet the first payment on the newly acquired Bond
Centre commercial complex in central Hong Kong.

    The sale has been opposed by the U.S. Commerce Department

Fairchild stake and said it would take a 200 mln dlrs charge in
the fourth quarter from the sale. The company ended up
recording special charges of 2.1 billion dlrs in the fourth
quarter, leading to a loss of 2.02 billion dlrs for the year.

    The proposed sale was under antitrust review by the U.S.
Justice Department. Additionally, Commerce Secretary Malcolm
Baldridge and other U.S. officials have voiced reservations
about the transaction since it was announced.

alternate buyer lined up for its Fairchild Semiconductor unit,
Wall Street analysts said.
    "I think its clear that in cancelling its agreement with
Fujitsu, Schlumberger has signaled that it has another deal in
the works," said Paul Johnson, a semiconductor analyst with
L.F. Rothschild.
    "There are unquestionably other buyers out there," added
Kidder Peabody analyst Adam F. Cuhney. "A lot of companies have
looked at Fairchild and would be willing to buy it."
    Among the companies that would be interested in bidding for
Fairchild are Advanced Micro Devices <AMD>, Sunnyvale, Calif.,
and LSI Logic Corp <LLSI>, Milpitas, Calif., industry analysts
said.
    Top U.S. chipmakers like National Semiconductor Corp <NSM>,
Texas Instruments Inc <TXN> and Motorola Inc <MOT> might also
seek to buy Fairchild, but could possibly run into antitrust
problems, the analysts added.
    Moreover, Fairchild's management is thought to be
considering proposing a leveraged buyout of the Cupertino,
Calif., company, analysts said.
    In a brief statement announcing the termination of the
agreement with Fujitsu, Schlumberger said the decision opened
up other possibilities, including a possible buyout by
Fairchild management.
    The company said it ended the deal, in which Fujitsu would
have bought 80 pct of Fairchild for an estimated 200 mln dlrs,
because rising opposition to the deal by the Reagan
administration made it unlikely that the sale could be
completed within a reasonable period of time.
    Analysts questioned this explanation, however, arguing that
the companies did not need government approval to complete the
transaction. Both Schlumberger and Fujitsu are foreigned-owned
companies.
    "Schlumberger would not have terminated the deal because
the U.S. government didn't want it," said Johnson of L.F.
Rothschild.
    A spokesman for Schlumberger declined to elaborate on the
company's news release.
    He said only that the company was reviewing a number of
possible alternatives for the Fairchild unit.
    Officials at Fairchild and Fujitsu were not immediately
available for comment.
    Analysts noted the significance of the government's
apparent success in preventing Fujitsu from taking control of
Fairchild.
    Administration officials, including Commerce Secretary
Malcolm Baldrige and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger,
feared that the sale to Fujitsu would lead to Japanese control
of key semiconductor technology for supercomputers and military
weapons systems.
    "The government really stood up for the semiconductor
industry," said Johnson of L.F. Rothschild. "That, I think, is
the real significance of this."
    Consequently, analysts said, the Japanese government might
now feel more pressure to address U.S. complaints about
Japanese chipmakers' violation of the semiconductor trade
agreement signed last summer.

acknowledged that he is one of the targets of an investigation
by the Securities and Exchange Commission into possible
violations of securities laws.
    Icahn, who heads and controls Trans World Airlines Inc
<TWA>, made the acknowledgement in a filing TWA was required to
make with the SEC disclosing its 14.8 pct stake in USAir Group.
    The SEC issued a formal order launching the private
investigation on Nov 12, 1986, Icahn said in the SEC filing.
    The order empowers SEC investigators to try to find out
whether any persons, including Icahn, violated securities laws
and related rules, Icahn said.
    Specifically, the probe is examining the acquisition and
subsequent sale of more than five pct of the stock of certain
unspecified companies, he said.
    Federal law requires individuals or groups of individuals
who have made shareholder agreements, to disclose stakes in
companies of at least five pct within 10 days.
    Icahn has acknowledged that he has been subpoenaed in
connection with SEC probes, but this is the first time he has
disclosed that he is among those being investigated.
    By making the disclosure in a filing with the SEC, which is
obviously already aware of its own probe, Icahn was also
alerting current and potential shareholders of TWA.
    It is not uncommon for companies which are aware that they
or their officers are the targets of government probes to
acknowledge the existence of the otherwise secret
investigations to fulfill their legal disclosure requirements
to their shareholders.
    Icahn said the SEC is looking into whether he and others
whom he did not name violated securities laws by acquiring and
selling more than five pct of a company's stock.
    SEC investigations into those kinds of possible securities
law violations have been spawned by the agency's widening probe
into the Wall Street insider trading scandal, according to
published reports.
    Making late filings of 13D forms, which disclose the amount
of stock over five pct an investor has in a company, or making
no filing at all could indicate a scheme to "warehouse" shares
of stock.
    In a warehousing scheme, a group of investors acting in
concert would each amass stock in the company without
disclosing that they have an agreement among them.
    By failing to disclose that they are acting together the
market is unware of the amount of stock of a company that is
controlled by a group acting in concert.
    Last year, the SEC charged members of the wealthy Belzberg
family of Canada with taking part in a warehousing scheme while
it was accumulating stock in Ashland Oil Inc.

end an agreement in principle for Fujitsu Ltd <ITSU.T> to buy
80 pct of its <Fairchild Semiconductor Corp>, and the political
furore that surrounded the proposed sale, will make Japanese
companies more cautious in their efforts to acquire U.S. High
technology firms but will not halt such attempts, industry
analysts said.
    The collapse of the deal will not be a critical blow to
Fujitsu but it will boost the cost of future U.S. Expansion by
the Japanese firm, said analysts polled by Reuters.
    "The acquisition of Fairchild is not essential to Fujitsu's
North American operations, but it would have been a great
boost," James Capel and Co analyst Tom Murtha said.
    French-controlled Schlumberger said yesterday it was ending
the agreement because mounting political controversy in the
U.S. Made it unlikely that the sale of the Fairchild stake
could be completed in a reasonable time.
    The sale was opposed by the U.S. Commerce Department and
Defence Department, partly on national security grounds.
    Fujitsu's acquisition of Fairchild would have given the
Japanese computer maker control of a comprehensive North
American sales and distribution system and access to
microprocessor technology, an area where Fujitsu is weak,
analysts said.
    The deal would also have given Fujitsu 14 additional
microchip production facilities worldwide, eight of them in the
U.S., A report by the Capel firm said.
    "It was an entry point, a port for semiconductors and a
marketing channel for other things," said Barclays de Zoete Wedd
analyst Rick May.
    Several analysts said the purchase would not have given
Fujitsu access to critical defence technology.
    "(Fairchild) simply doesn't have key technology -- that's a
thing of the past," May said.
    The failure could be a blessing in disguise for Fujitsu as
it might have had to spend several hundred million dollars to
modernise Fairchild's production lines, Capel's Murtha said.
    The failure of the deal will doubtless encourage Japanese
firms to take a lower profile in attempts to acquire U.S. High
tech firms but they are unlikely to stop, analysts said.
    Most analysts said Fujitsu was likely to go the more costly
route of expanding its own production and distribution
facilities in the U.S., Although some said it could use the
estimated 200 mln dlrs set aside for buying Fairchild to try to
acquire some less politically symbolic firm.
    "It may slow the pace of Japanese acquisitions, but the
necessity of expanding their production and design capacity in
America remains," said Capel's Murtha. "The Japanese will
continue to shop for bargains, but it will be harder to find
ones that are politically acceptable."
    Japanese firms are likely to favour joint ventures or
smaller equity stakes in firms to avoid the political backlash
that blocked the Fairchild sale, analysts said. "They're not
going to slow up, they're just going to buy smaller pieces ...
Because of the political risk," said Barclays de Zoete's May.
    Several Japanese firms have already taken 10 to 30 pct
shares in smaller U.S. High technology firms such as super
minicomputer makers, he said.
    Opposition of the sort that blocked Fujitsu could end up
harming U.S. Firms and undermining a trend toward multinational
tie-ups, some analysts said.
    "This is not really of benefit to U.S. Firms either," said
Jardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd analyst Nick Edwards. "The
pooling of resources in semiconductors is a positive move --
why should the government step in to prevent it?"
    Japan's Minister of International Trade and Industry Hajime
Tamura told a press conference that interference by U.S.
Government officials in the Fairchild deal was inappropriate.
    "This is entirely a private sector matter and not a matter
for governments' comment," Tamura said. "I think it was improper
for U.S. Government officials to intervene to the extent they
did," he said.
    A spokesman told Reuters the ministry's view is that
international investment flows ought to be free and that such
flows are of increasing importance in line with the growing
closeness of U.S.-Japanese economic ties.

director at one of the partner firms said.
    Marc Mathieu of <Societe Anonyme de Telecommunications>
SAT, told journalists the bid foresaw a direct stake of 20 pct
for APT, the joint firm set up by the U.S.'s ATT <T.N.> and the
NV Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken <PGLO.AS>.
    The other 80 pct would be owned by a holding company made
up of SAT, APT, Cie du Midi <MCDP.PA> and five mutual funds.
   Under French law, foreign investors are restricted to a 20
pct direct stake in privatised companies but can boost their
stake to 40 pct through indirect holdings.
    The make-up of the holding company, however, is subject to
close discussions within the government due to legal queries

declined to give details or say how an increase would affect
foreign stakes in CGCT.
    In 1985, CGCT posted losses of 200 mln francs on sales of

to investing 240 mln francs in CGCT research and production

produce APT 5ESS-PRX switching technology and adapt it to
French standards.
    The tender was launched after a 1985 draft agreement for
ATT to take over CGCT was abandoned following the introduction
of the French government privatisation laws which reopened
bidding among a wider range of applicants.

    In a letter to shareholders appearing in the company's

did not elaborate on how much earnings were expected to
increase.
    The 1986 profits of Coastal, a natural gas production and

energy prices. The company's sales totaled 6.7 billion dlrs
last year.
    Coastal also said it sold its natural gas for an average

previous year. Oil and natural gas liquids sold for an average
14.20 dlrs a barrel in 1986, a reduction of 37 pct.

three points today as its vice chairman and an investment group
proposed to sweeten a takeover offer for the company.
    However, several arbitragers said they would shy away from
the stock at its current price levels since it is unclear how
high bidding for the company would go and whether the company
would agree to a takeover.
    "There are too many uncertainties," said one arbitrager.
    Taft stock rose 2-7/8 to 155-3/4.
    Dudley Taft, Taft vice chairman, and Narragansett Capital
Inc said they sent a letter to the Taft board, stating they
were committed to pursuing acquisition of the broadcast company
and were prepared to negotiate a transaction in excess of 150
dlrs per share.
    The company responded that the proposal would be submitted
to the board of directors, but that no decisions have yet been
made on a sale of the company.
    "Someone's betting this company will go for 170 (dlrs per
share)," said one arbitrager.
    Arbitragers said the stock is a risky buy at current
levels, unless an offer was accepted in the 170 dlr per share
range. They said to make an arbitrage investment at this level
would be chancy since it will take a long time for any
transaction to be completed because of regulatory approvals
necessary for the broadcast properites.
    Taft earlier rejected a 145 dlr per share or 1.35 billion
dlr bid from the investment group. The company said it rejected
the bid as inadequate based on advice of Goldman, Sachs and Co,
its financial adviser. It said it would consider alternatives
such as restructuring.
    Arbitragers speculated a bidding war may erupt for Taft,
which has two large shareholders in an investment group led by
Robert Bass and Carl Lindner, chairman of American Financial
Corp. The Bass group holds 25 pct of Taft and Lindner holds
16.2 pct. The Taft family, which founded the company almost 50
years ago, has about 12 pct.
    Lindner last week told the Securities and Exchange
Commission he may be interested in making a bid for Taft.
    "I could see if things got really crazy that it might go
for 175 (dlrs per share)," said one arbitrager, but he
speculated it probably would not even be taken over for more
than a price in the 160s.
    Another speculated that Lindner might bid, but he
speculated the investor would not really be interested in
running the company. Lindner was unavailable for comment.
    Dennis McAlpine, an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co, said
he had speculated the company might be considering a leveraged
buyout.
    "Ideally, you'd have to break this thing up to satisfy all
the interests involved," he said, adding the two largest
shareholders might be interested in pieces of Taft.
    He said the highest takeover price he calculated for the
company has been about 140 dlrs per share, but that the highest
estimates on Wall Street have been about 160. He said the
latter would be based on more optimistic expectations for the
broadcast industry.

    Allegheny noted it had previously cancelled plans to spin

    The company said the group's review is preliminary and
there is no assurance that an acquisition proposal will be made
or, if made, accepted.
    Service America had fiscal 1986 revenues of about 934 mln

to improve operations and increase earnings at the unit.
    Service America, which Allegheny acquired in May 1985,
operates cafeterias and food and beverage vending machines.
Through other subsidiaries, Allegheny provides coin-operated
laundry services, building maintenance services and retail
office and furniture operations.

excluding income of 59.7 mln dlrs from discontinued operations
and an extraordinary loss of 8.1 mln dlrs. In May 1985,

Soriano Corp, the family company of San Miguel president Andres
Soriano, del Rosario said.
    The shares are worth some 500 mln pesos at recent prices.
    Del Rosario said the 14 mln B shares in the block which are

unidentified foreign purchasers.
    He said SMC and UCPB would meet later this week to try to

    President Corazon Aquino earlier this month established an
arbitration panel to settle a row over the disposal of the

    Their initial sale to Soriano through SMC Hong Kong unit
Neptunia Corp was blocked by the Presidential Commission on
Good Government.
    The commission sequestered the stock on suspicion that the
real owner of the block was Eduardo Cojuanco, the former
chairman of San Miguel and the UCPB and a close associate of
deposed former president Ferdinand Marcos.

falling prey to Japanese corporations bulging with cash and
eager to extend their reach further overseas, according to
merger and acquisitions specialists polled by Reuters.
    Already, rich Japanese companies have pounced on U.S.
Banks, steel and other businesses.
    In the latest attempt, Fujitsu Ltd <ITSU.T> -- Japan's
biggest computer maker -- unsuccessfully bid for <Fairchild
Semiconductor Corp>, a U.S. Microchip maker which supplies
components for supercomputers.
    Nomura Securities Co Ltd <NMSC.T> and Daiwa Securities Co
Ltd <DSEC.T>, Japan's two largest brokerage firms, are seeking
a niche in the U.S. And European securities markets, while the
country's huge banks are looking for strongholds in overseas
banking, the takeover specialists said.
    Major trading houses, which see their profits evaporating
in the heat of increased competition in merchandise trade, all
have foreign businesses on their shopping lists.
    Among manufacturers, car parts makers are under the most
pressure to buy up overseas companies and follow the big auto
makers they subcontract for as these move offshore.
    "The timing is favourable for Japanese parties to buy up
potential overseas businesses, especially in the U.S. --
Japan's largest market and where political risks are minimal," a
takeover specialist at one trading company said.
    Japanese companies have become among the world's richest
after a series of boom export years and as the yen has climbed
against the dollar by some 40 pct in the past 18 months.
    But the yen's strength, which has also raised the costs of
Japan's exports and allowed its Asian neighbours to move into
its traditional markets, has frozen Japanese corporate growth,
the specialists said.
    Looming trade friction is also threatening to erect more
barriers against Japanese exports.
    Japanese firms see overseas acquisitions as a way to avoid
the gloomy growth outlook and put their excess cash to work.
Domestic interest rates, now at record lows, offer little
investment opportunity.
    "Japanese interest in acquisitions has been continuous, but
the recent economic factors have become a driving force," said a
banking industry source.
    So far, though, the Japanese are being cautious.
    While mergers and acquisitions among U.S. Firms number in
the thousands, Japanese buyouts of overseas companies have
totalled just a few dozen, one merchant banker said.
    Another merchant banker said that a flurry of Japanese
acquisition activity was originally expected five years from
now, but that time span appeared now to be too long.
    Japanese firms are becoming more aggressive now, he said.
    A turning point seemed to be Dainippon Ink and Chemicals
Inc's <DIAC.T> takeover bid for <Sun Chemical Corp> of the U.S.
Last year, which some analysts saw as somewhat hostile, he
added.
    Dainippon Ink bought Sun Chemical's graphic arts group for
550 mln dlrs late last year, after an earlier unsolicited bid
for the whole company. Sun Chemical refused to sell its entire
business after learning that Dainippon planned to liquidate all
but its graphic arts-related businesses.
    Hostile takeovers are considered unethical and frowned upon
by the Japanese, the trading company official says. "Japanese
people don't like fighting. They prefer peaceful amicable
deals." But now after some experience overseas, Japanese
companies are acquainted with local practice, he adds. "This is
a healthy progression."
    However, the experts do not expect the Japanese to run the
board meetings of any giant U.S. Or European concerns.
    "Japanese companies are not fully confident in managing a
large U.S. Or European corporation," one banker said. "They will
expand their operations only gradually, a typical way for
Japanese business."
    A foreign merchant banker also noted, "There are not many
mega-deals left to do in the United States. A lot of the big
deals there have already been done."
    But medium-size and small concerns are potential targets of
Japanese companies, the specialists said.
    Japanese will be aiming for new businesses in
high-technology areas. "Japanese companies had used technology
and quality to get where they are and are unlikely to deviate
from that trend," one takeover specialist said.
    Many are watching the results of the first acquisitions. If
these succeed, activity could build, the specialists said.
    But few such specialists are going to sit back and wait
until the action begins. Already, they said, Japanese trading
houses, long-term credit and commercial banks, brokerages and
foreign merchant banks have set up research sections to act as
go-betweens in deals or find good buys for themselves.

over 82 mln dlrs worth of Goodwood Park Hotel Ltd shares and
loan stock certificates belonging to the company's chairman,

(PNB) will fund Toyota Motor Corp's <TOYO.T> planned purchase
of its bankrupt former local partner's manufacturing facilities
for at least 193 mln pesos, a bank official told reporters.
    Toyota has informed the Philippine government it plans to
produce cars again here in joint venture with a local partner.
    It proposes to invest about 400 mln pesos in the
manufacture of car spare parts and other items, and generate
about 100 mln pesos in export earnings over five years.
    The banker said today a letter of intent was signed three
weeks ago but the sale requires approval from government
agencies charged with selling private sector assets taken over
by state-owned banks.
    Official sources said Toyota's application was likely to be
approved.
    Toyota severed ties with its Philippine partner of 20
years, <Delta Motor Corp>, in 1984 because the local company
was suffering financial difficulties. PNB later foreclosed on
Delta's assets.

sources closely linked with the transaction said.
    A spokesman for the Finance Ministry said no exact date had
yet been set for the privatisation, which the government has
tabled for the second half of March. However, he added a
scandal at Volkswagen AG <VOWG.F>, VW, over currency losses "has
nothing to do" with the timing of the VEBA sale.
    Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg has said the sale of
the Federal government's stake in VW, originally scheduled for
later this year, may be delayed because of the currency affair.
    A banker involved in the VEBA placement said "Nothing has
changed in the planning. I still presume that it will take
place in the second half of March."
    This banker said there would be no reason to postpone the
issue of the 10 mln VEBA shares for a few days. He added that
the consortium which is arranging the deal had completed its
preparatory work, although the price had not been decided.
    The VEBA share has been weaker ahead of the placement but
West German stocks have been generally bearish and news of the
VW scandal last week put further pressure on the market.

approximately 2.3 mln shares in the company at 90.25 dlrs each.
    This represents just over 54 pct of the outstanding shares
on a fully diluted basis. But including shares already owned,
Dixons now holds a total of 56 pct of the fully diluted
outstanding shares.
    The company said it is now entitled to subscribe for all
the authorised but unissued and unreserved shares of common
stock of Cyclops, which total some 5.4 mln shares, at 90.25
dlrs each.
    Dixons said it has waived its condition that 80 pct of the
fully diluted outstanding shares be validly tendered and not
withdrawn.
    Dixons launched the agreed 384 mln dlr offer on February 17
this year in the wake of its unsuccessful battle to take over
the U.K. Retail store chain Woolworth Holdings Plc <WLUK.L>.

privately-held Wagner and Brown and by AFG Industries Inc, said
it has started a tender offer for all common shares of GenCorp
Inc and associated defensive preferred share purchase rights
for 100 dlrs a share.
    GenCorp stock closed yesterday in composite tape trading at
90.50 dlrs a share, up two dlrs on the day.
    In a newspaper advertisement, General Partners said the
offer and withdrawal rights expire April 14 unless extended.
    General Partners said the offer is conditioned on receipt
of sufficient financing to buy all shares on a fully diluted
basis and receipt of enough shares to give General Partners at
least 51 pct voting power, again fully diluted.
    It said the offer is also conditioned on GenCorp redeeming
the defensive rights or General Partners being satisfied that
the rights have been invalidated and General Partners obtaining
from the Federal Communications Commission a special temporary
authorization allowing completion of the acquisition of GenCorp
shares.
    General Partners said it would set up voting trust
arrangements pending review of its long-form application for
FCC approval of its acquisition of control of GenCorp's
broadcasting subsidiary.
    The partnership said the offer is further conditioned on
GenCorp management withdrawing its proposals to amend the
company's articles of incorporation and code of regulations to
provide for an increase in authorized common shares, a
classified board of directors and the elimination of cumulative
voting.  The latter two changes would make it harder for
minority shareholders to elect directors.
    General Partners said it is asking GenCorp for its
shareholder lists for help in disseminating the offer.
    GenCorp has about 22.3 mln shares outstanding, making the
value of the offer about 2.23 billion dlrs.
    Last fall, AFG and Wagner and Brown offered to acquire
<Lear Siegler Inc> for about 1.44 billion dlrs but withdrew the
offer when higher bids emerged and due to complications of the
Tax Reform Act of 1986.  Lear Siegler eventually went private
for 1.66 billion dlrs.
    GenCorp is involved in tire and plasticmaking and aerospace
as well as broadcasting.  The company faces challenges to its
two television and 12 radio station licenses, partly becuase it
failed to inform the FCC about allegedly improper foreign
payments and political contributions.
    GenCorp has agreed to sell its New York-area television
station WOR to MCA Inc <MCA> for 387 mln dlrs and its Los
Angeles station KHJ to Walt Disney Co <DIS> for 217 mln dlrs.
An investor group challenging the Los Angeles license would
also receive 103 mln dlrs from Disney.
    For the year ended November 30, GenCorp earned 130 mln dlrs
on sales of 3.10 billion dlrs.
    A GenCorp spokesman said the offer came as a surprise and
the company was not yet in a position to comment on the bid.

Pacific Telesis group <PAC.N> may take part in a proposed
merger of two rival firms seeking to enter Japan's
international telecommunications market, a senior industry
official said.
    Fumio Watanabe, head of a telecommunications committee with
the Federation of Economic Organisations (Keidanren), told a
news conference Japanese shareholders in the two consortiums
agreed that the U.S. And British companies will be invited to
participate in the new merged firm.
    The planned linkup will satisfy Tokyo's request that only
one private company should enter the market.
    The two consortiums, <International Digital Communications
Planning Inc> (IDC) and <International Telecom Japan> (ITJ),
were set up in 1986 to compete with monopoly <Kokusai Denshin
Denwa Co> (KDD) after the market was deregulated in 1985.
    Watanabe said the Post and Telecommunications Ministry
wanted only one competitor for the time being because of the
size of the Japanese telcommunications market and that foreign
investors will only be allowed to hold a minority stake.
    He estimated the two foreign firms' share in the merged
consortium at less than three pct and added that even the
largest shareholders could own only some five pct .
    Cable and Wireless and Japanese trading house <C. Itoh and
Co.> each have a 20 pct stake in the IDC consortium while
Pacific Telesis and Merrill Lynch and Co. Inc. <MER.N> jointly
hold 13 pct .
    ITJ is headed by a rival group of trading houses. Several
firms including Toyota Motor Corp. <TOYO.T>  belong to both.
    Watanabe said progress was being made towards a merger
agreement and added that Japanese industry agreed with the
government on having only one private consortium as two
companies might invest "excessive" amounts.
    He said talks with Cable & Wireless will continue this

outstanding common stock.
    General Partners said it began a 100 dlrs a share cash
tender offer for all of Gencorp, an Akron, Ohio-based concern,
that is worth nearly 2.3 billion dlrs.
    Gencorp, which has interests in tire- and plastic-making,
aerospace and broadcasting, has about 22.3 mln shares
outstanding.
    The General Partners offer is subject to receipt of
financing, a majority of Gencorp shares and other conditions.
    In a letter to Gencorp chairman and chief executive A.
William Reynolds describing the offer, General Partners said it
was willing to negotiate terms of the offer and was prepared to
meet as soon as possible.
    In a statement, General Partners said it has contributed
250 mln dlrs in equity financing and also has commitments for 
a one billion dlr credit line from Wells Fargo and Co <WFC> and
a 1.25 billion loan from Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc,
a unit of American Express Co <AXP>.

said he was not sure the company had formally received notice
of the offer but was aware of it through press accounts.
    He declined to say what Gencorp's next move might be or
whether it would issue a statement later today.
    In the letter, General Partners said it plans to maintain

company's plastics and industrial products businesses and its
tires and related products segment.
    The letter did not mention Gencorp's RKO General
broadcasting subsidiary, which has been involved in disputes
over license renewals at several of its television stations.
Gencorp has agreed to sell two of its independent stations, WOR
in the New York area and KHJ in Los Angeles.
    General Partners officials were not immediately available.
    Gencorp shares were delayed at the opening on the New York
Stock Exchange because of an imbalance of orders, and the NYSE
said the shares were indicated to open at 103 to 115. The
shares closed up two yesterday at 90-1/2, a new 52-week high.
    The financing for the offer includes the 250 mln dlrs in
equity from General Partners, the 1.25 billion dlr loan from
Shearson Lehman Brothers, a senior subordinated bridge loan for
which a binding agreement can be delivered within 24 hours
after a request from the partnership, and the one billion dlr

    Wells Fargo has agreed to lend up to 250 mln dlrs of the
line itself and form a syndicate of banks to provide the rest,

Commission (SEC) staff is seeking authority to take enforcement
action against Allegheny International Inc, the
Pittsburgh-based industrial and consumer products firm said.
    Allegheny made the disclosure in documents filed with the
SEC in connection with its recent agreement to be taken private
through a leveraged buyout led by First Boston Inc.
    "Following announcement of the merger agreement, the company
was informed by the Enforcement Division of the (SEC) that it
intends to seek authority from the commission to institute a
proceeding against the company," Allegheny said.
    "The company is cooperating in the commission's
investigation which is continuing and now includes the taking
of testimony of employes and others," Allegheny said.
    In the ongoing probe, Allegheny said, the staff has asked
for information about company executive compensation and
benefit plans, certain company-owned real estate, travel and
entertainment spending and the use of corporate aircraft.
    It also has asked for information on acquisitions and
divestitures, the company's accounting system "and other
internal controls," Allegheny said.
   The probe began in February 1986, Allegheny said.
    The SEC, as a matter of policy, routinely declines comment
on its enforcement actions.
    The SEC investigation began just months before Allegheny
became the target of a series of shareholder lawsuits claiming
that the company had violated the federal securities laws by
failing to disclose material matters in recent annual proxy
statements.
    The suits, later consolidated into a single class-action
complaint before a Pennsylvania federal court, allege
securities law violations involving numerous current and former
Allegheny officers and directors.
    Earlier this month, lawyers for the shareholders asked the
court to expand the charges to include an allegation that, in
the buyout, Allegheny had attempted to illegally freeze out its
public shareholders at an unfair price.
    Allegheny said it intends to vigorously defend itself
against all charges.
    The charges made in the shareholder suits are widely
believed to have led to last summer's resignation of Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer Robert Buckley.

    The takeover provision was sent to the full Energy and

    The subcommittee's bill would bar imports of digital audio

offer for Ohio-based conglomerate GenCorp Inc will not be
enough to buy the company, analysts said.
    Analysts estimated the 100 dlr-per-share offer from General
Partners is 10 to 20 dlrs per share below the breakup value of
GenCorp. However, market sources and analysts said  uncertainty
surrounds any transaction because of the legal challenges to
Gencorp broadcasting licenses.
    Gencorp's stock rose 15-3/4 to 106-1/4 in heavy trading.
    "The expectation is either there will be someone else or
the bidder will sweeten the offer hoping to get management's
cooperation," said Larry Baker, an analyst with E.F. Hutton
group.
    Analysts said there is concern about challenges to
Gencorp's broadcast licenses for two television and 12 radio
stations. Some of the disputes, dating back about 20 years,
were brought by groups that alleged improper foreign payments
and political contributions.
    "I think it kind of muddies an already muddy situation,"
said Baker of the offer.
    Some arbitragers said they were concerned the ongoing issue
might be a stumbling block or result in a long period of time
for any transaction.
    A source close to General Partners, however, said General
Partners would apply to the Federal Communications Commission
for special temporary authority to hold the broadcast stations.
The source said if approved, the authority would allow a
transaction to be carried out.
    If it received the "short-form" approval, General Partners
would set up a trust which would hold the broadcasting
properties until the licensing situation is resolved.
    General Partners is equally owned by investors Wagner and
Brown and glass-maker AFG Industries Inc.
    Some market sources speculated an outside buyer, such as
General Partners, might even be be a catalyst to resolution of
the challenges since it would carry out GenCorp's plan to sell
the stations.
    GenCorp earlier this month reached an agreement with Walt
Disney Co to sell its Los Angeles television station, WHJ-TV.
Disney would pay 217 mln dlrs to GenCorp and 103 mln dlrs to a
group that challenged the station's license.
    GenCorp also has a pending agreement to sell WOR-TV in
Secaucus, N.J. to MCA Inc for 387 mln dlrs.
    General Partners said it intends to keep the company's
plastics and industrial products businesses and its tires and
related products segment.
    Charles Rose, an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co, said
that, on a breakup valuation, the company might be worth as
much as 125 dlrs per share. Rose estimated the aerospace
business could bring 30 to 40 dlrs per share or one billion
dlrs, as would DiversiTech, the plastics unit. Broadcasting,
including assets pending sale, might be 30 to 40 dlrs per
share, he said.
    The company, formerly known as General Tire
and Rubber Co, also has a tire business Rose estimated would be
worth five to 10 dlrs per share. He estimated the bottling
business might also be worth several dollars per share, he
said.
    Analysts said GenCorp chairman A. William Reynolds, who
became chairman last year, has been emphasizing the company's
Aerojet General and DiversiTech General businesses. GenCorp,
founded in 1915, became an unfocused conglomerate over the
years and analysts believe reynolds has helped it to improve.
    "The management's doing a very fine job in trying to deal
with the non-strategic assets of the company," Rose said.
    Analysts expect GenCorp to resist the tender offer, but
they declined to predict what steps the company might take.
They said it would be possible the company might consider a
leveraged buyout or restructuring to fend off the offer.
    General Partners holds 9.8 pct of GenCorp stock, and there
was some concern about "greenmail." Greenmail is the payment at
a premium for an unwanted shareholders' stock.
    "I would doubt they would greenmail them, but nothing
surprises me anymore," said Rose.
    GenCorp has not commented on the offer. It has retained
First Boston Corp and Kidder, Peabody and Co as advisers.

that its board and the board of Norstar Bancorp have agreed to
merge the two bank holding companies in a transaction which
would create a 23 billion dlr asset bank holding company.
    Under terms of the transaction, each Norstar shareholder
will receive 1.2 shares of Fleet common stock based on the
number of Fleet shares after giving effect to a previously
announced April one Fleet stock split.
     The two-for-one stock split will increase Fleet's
currently 25.7 mln outstanding shares to 51.5 shares. There are
about 34.9 mln Norstar shares outstanding.
    Fleet said the deal is expected to be completed by July one
1988, the date on which the nationalization of Rhode Island's
interstate banking law takes effect.
    For the full year ended december 31, Fleet, a Rhode Island
based bank holding company, reported net income of 136.7 mln
dlrs and assets of 11.7 billion dlrs. Norstar, an Albany N.y.
holding company, reported net income of 104.8 mln dlrs and
assets of 11.1 billion dlrs.
     Fleet comptroller Irv Goss said it is estimated that the
transaction will result in minimal dilution in Fleet/Norstar
earnings per share. It is the intention of both companies that
cash quarterly dividends following the combination not decline
for either company's stock holders, the company said.
    For 1986, Norstar issued 1.31 dlrs annually in cash
dividends on its common stock. Fleet's current annual
distibution on a pre-split basis would be equivalent to 1.68
dlrs a share.
    In addition, Fleet and Norstar have each granted the other
an option to purchase such number of authorized buy unissued
shares of common stock, that will constitute 24.99 pct of the
fully diluted shares outstanding.
    The transaction is subject to both regulatory and

acquisition of Gelco Corp's <GEC> Canadian unit has
dramatically altered Canada's fast growing courier industry,
largely dominated by U.S. companies until this year, company
officials and analysts said.
    State-owned Air Canada takes over the country's second
largest overnight courier business just two months after
another Canadian company, <Onex Capital Corp Ltd>, approved the
acquisition of number one ranked Purolator Courier Ltd from New
Jersey-based Purolator Courier Corp <PCC>.
    But analysts said the two acquisitions were prompted by
financial restructuring undertaken by the U.S. parent companies
and likely don't represent an industry trend toward buying out
foreign owned courier operations.
    "It's a case of whether you can buy from the right people at
the right time," McLeod Young Weir Ltd transportation analyst
Tony Hine commented.
    The two acquisitions fit with a larger move by U.S.
companies embroiled in a take-over or restructuring to sell-off
their Canadian units to generate ready cash, said Nesbitt
Thomson Deacon Inc analyst Harold Wolkin.
    "There is a very good correlation between the U.S. parent
selling Canadian subsidiaries and the U.S. parent either being
under siege or taking someone else over," he said.
    Gelco Corp, of Minnesota, decided to sell Gelco Express Ltd
as part of its previously announced program to sell off four
operating units to buy back shares and pay down debt, Gelco
Express marketing vice president James O'Neil told Reuters.
    The sale is the first under Gelco's divestiture program,
and proceeds will be used to help pay down 350 mln U.S. dlrs of
debt by year-end, the company said.
    While company officials declined to disclose earnings and
revenue figures, O'Neil said Gelco Express holds a dominant
position in the industry, handling more than 50,000 packages a
day and generating revenues of more than 100 mln Canadian dlrs
a year.
    The earlier move by Purolator to sell its Canadian unit
formed an important part of a company restructuring program,
adopted after another Canadian Company, <Unicorp Canada Corp>,
acquired a 12.6 pct stake in Purolator and said it would
consider acquiring the whole company.
    Last month, Purolator agreed to be acquired by a company
formed by E.F. Hutton LBO Inc and certain managers of
Purolator's U.S. courier business.
    For Air Canada, its acquisition of Gelco's Canadian courier
business represents an "excellent financial investment" in a
market it sees growing by 25 to 30 pct annually, spokesman
Esther Szynkarsky said.
    The airline also announced it acquired a 65 pct stake in
EMS Corp, of Calgary, an in-city messenger service.
    It did not disclose financial terms, but Szynkarsky said
the two acquisitions totalled about 90 mln Canadian dlrs, and
the two business have combined yearly revenues of 170 mln dlrs.
    She said the acquisition fit with Air Canada's strategy of
seeking attractive investments that compliment its main airline
business.
    Gelco will continue to operate with current management,
independently of Air Canada, although Air Canada already
operates its own air cargo business that includes a small
door-to-door courier operation.
    "They're well run, they're a good investment, they're doing
well in a growing market, and that's the way we want to keep
it," Szynkarsky said.
    Analyst Hine said the Gelco and Purolator Canadian units
will likely retain operating links with their U.S. delivery
network, generating traffic for the former parent companies
without them having to tie up capital in Canada.
    "The nature of the business is that incremental traffic is
incremental revenue," Hine said.
    "It's sort of a sausage maker business where you put in
place the sausage grinder, and the more sausage you can stuff
through, the more money you make," he added.

it would sell off its remaining 31.7 pct shareholding in
British Petroleum Co Plc <BP.L> during the next financial year
which starts on April 1.
    Treasury Financial Secretary Norman Lamont made the
announcement to Parliament. He said, "The government's policy is
to sell its minority holdings in companies as and when
circumstances permit.
    "As part of this policy I am now able to announce that,
subject to market conditions, the government will sell its
remaining shares in BP during the 1987/88 financial year."
    The last sale of British government shares in BP was in
September 1983. The government currently holds some 578.5 mln
ordinary shares in the company.
    Lamont said the Treasury would appoint financial advisers
for the sale. Merchant banks and stockbrokers interested in
being considered for this would be interviewed in early April.
    In September 1983, the U.K. Government sold 150 mln shares
in an underwritten offer for sale by tender. The striking price
then was 435 pence - 7.5 pct above the minimum tender price, a

    He said the sale of BP shares would not cut across the

proposed merger with Norstar Bancorp <NOR>, ranked as the
largest U.S. banking merger, can be completed by the beginning
of 1988, according to an executive of Fleet.
    Robert Lougee, director of corporate communications for
Rhode Island-based Fleet, told Reuters the company is exploring
the possiblity of seeking a change in the national trigger date
for the state's reciprocal bank law to Jan 1, 1988 from July
one. The decision is up to the Rhode Island legislature.
    The merger plan was announced in a midday news release that
said the deal, worth about 1.3 billion dlrs, would be
consummated July one when Rhode Island barriers to interstate
banking outside of New England come down. "If we can consummate
the deal earlier that would be better for all concerned,"
Lougee said. He said to the best of his knowledge a change in
the Rhode Island law would not be a hardship for any other
banking institution in the state.
    He said Fleet is optimstic Connecticut law, which only
permits interstate banking mergers within New England, can be
amended. Fleet owns First Connecticut Bancorp.
    If the Connecticut law is not amended in time, Lougee said,
an option would be to spin off that unit with repurchase
provisions.
    The New England reciprocal banking laws have excluded New
York as a means of protecting regional banks from being gobbled
up by the money center giants.
    Wall Street analysts said the merger accord between Fleet
and Albany, N.Y.-based Norstar demonstrates the rapid pace of
interstate banking mergers since state legislatures begain
permitting regional mergers on a reciprocal basis. The U.S.
Supreme Court decided in mid-1985 to permit the mergers.
    Fleet and Norstar in a joint statement billed the proposed
merger as "a partnership of two companies." Both will continue
to operate existing headquarters after the merger.
    Norstar holders will receive 1.2 Fleet shares for each one
of theirs following Fleet's previously announced two-for-one
split. Fleet shares closed today at 59-1/2, up 1/8, giving the
deal an indicated value of 1.3 billion dlrs.
    That topped the proposed merger of Los Angeles-based
Security Pacific Corp <SPC> and Seattle's Rainier Bancorpartion
<RBAN>. The West Coast deal, announced about four weeks ago, is
worth an estimated 1.2 billion dlrs.
    Chemical New York Corp's <CHL> acquisition of Texas
Commerce Bancshares last year was valued at about 1.2 billion
dlrs, making it similar in size to the Security Pacific-Rainer
deal. The California combination of Wells Fargo and Co <WFC>
and Crocker National Corp last year was worth 1.1 billion dlrs
and there have been several bank mergers in the southeast
valued in the 700-800 mln dlr range.
    "It's a merger of equals," said analyst John Rooney of
Moseley Securities Corp. He said Norstar had a book value at
the end of 1986 of 19.63 dlrs per share, while Fleet's book
value was 28.02 dlrs.
    Rooney noted that Norstar chairman Peter Kiernan is in his
60's while Fleet's Terrence Murray is in his late 40's. He said
Kiernan would probably head the combined company until his
retirement then Murray could assume the top post.
    Analyst Thaddeus Paluszek of Merrill Lynch and Co said
Fleet's earnings would have been diluted about two pct in 1986
on the basis of the merger terms announced today.
    He noted that Fleet has a "teriffic reputation" after
having diversified in a number of financial areas. Fleet has
established consumer banks in the southeast and is known as an
innovator in securitization of mortgages.
    The merged banks would have assets in excess of 25 billion
dlrs and be one of the 25 largest banks in the U.S.  Norstar
operates in most of New York state but not in New York City.
    Lougee said at some point in the future banking operations
that both Norstar and Fleet operate in the state of Maine would
be combined.
    The agreement between Norstar and Fleet includes a
"lock-up" option designed to deter other acquirers. Each
granted the other an option to purchase authorized but unissued
shares amounting to 24.99 pct of the fully diluted shares
outstanding.

    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
General Partners said proceeds from the sale of GenCorp's
aerospace division would help it repay some of the debt it

    General Partners, which launched the surprise tender offer
today, said it already 2,180,608 shares of GenCorp, or 9.4 pct

    General Partners, which estimated the total cost of the
takeover at 2.5 billion dlrs, also said it plans to continue
GenCorp's policy of trying to settle Federal Communications
Commission charges against two of its television and 12 radio

    It said it would also continue GenCorp's policy of trying
to sell its New York-area television station WOR to MCA Inc

Disney Co <DIS> for 217 mln dlrs.
    But General Partners said it plans to keep GenCorp's
headquarter in Akron, Ohio.
    General Partners also said it would maintain GenCorp's
plastics and industrial products division as well as tires and
related products.
    But it left open that it might make other changes in
GenCorp's operations after it completes the merger.
    Besides using 250 mln dlrs of its own equity for the tender
offer, General Partners said it would seek one billion dlrs
under a secured margin facility from Wells Fargo Bank N.A.
and other banks. It also said it would seek 1.25 billion dlrs
from the sale to Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc or its
affiliates of senior subordinated promissory notes.
    In a March 18 letter to GenCorp Chairman William Reynolds,
which was included in the SEC filing, General Partners
officials said they were "confident of our ability to promptly
obtain the remaining funding as described in our offer
materials."
    "For this reason, we do not forsee any obstacles to a
prompt consummation of the transaction," General Partners said.
    Shearson is dealer manager of the General Partners offer

agreed to buy a 45 pct interest in a company that will sell
condoms produced by INKEY SA of Spain.
    It said a spermicide used in INKEY's condoms contains an
ingredient that may help prevent the sexual transmission of
AIDS. The ingredient was cited in an article in the West German
publication, Aids Forschung. But it said the article was
about the ingredient and did not mention the spermicide or the
condoms made by INKEY.
    The company also said it is changing its name to
Eurocapital Corp shortly.
    Solar Systems said it was buying the 45 pct stake in a
U.S.-based <Europharmaceutical Co>. INKEY and an affiliate own
the remaining shares of the company, which was set up to
distribute condoms and vaginal products that are made, or are
being developed by INKEY.
    The agreement calls for a two mln dlr payment to Inkey for
the distributorship. The first 500,000 dlr payment is due 30
days after the products are approved by the Food and Drug
Administration. It said Europharmaceutical plans to soon file
with the FDA to market the condom, but expects the approval
process to be a lengthy one.
    The company said the active ingredient in the spermicide is
currently used in the U.S. in antiseptic applications unrelated
to condoms. As far as it knows, the ingredient has not been
tested in a spermicide.
    Inkey's condoms will be sold in the U.S. under the brand
name, "Carlton." The exclusive distribution contract for the
products runs for three years and is renewable for one-year
periods, the company said.
    It said the condoms are currently sold in Spain but have
not gone on sale in other European countries.
    It said Europharmaceutical currently does not have the
resources to make the payments under the distribution agreement
or fund the studies necessary to obtain marketing approval from
the FDA.
    The company also said Europharmaceutical is in talks to
acquire either one or more publicly held companies with little
or no assets. In the event an acquisition goes through, Solar
Systems' interest in Europharmaceutical would be diluted below
its current 45 pct.

stake in its Shearson Lehman Brothers is believed to be a
prelude to a public offering of shares in the brokerage unit,
analysts said.
    American Express earlier said it has a general
understanding with Nippon Life Insurance Co of Japan to sell a
13 pct interest in Shearson for 530 mln dlrs.
    The statement triggered a rise in other brokerage stocks,
as investors speculated on the possibility of more investment
in the U.S. brokerage industry by Japanese concerns.
    The stocks of brokerage firms also climbed in response to
the relatively high value Nippon put on its stake in the U.S.
firm. Analysts said the 530 mln dlrs for 13 pct represents a
price of 2.7 times book value.
    Perrin Long of Lipper analytical said the brokerage stocks,
depressed somewhat by the dark cloud of the U.S. insider
trading scandal, closed out February at a market value of 1.8
times book value.
    American Express was trading today at 78-1/4, off 3/8. For
the last several weeks, the stock has been strong on rumors of
a spinoff of part of Shearson.
    Analysts said American Express and its Shearson unit will
benefit from the doors Nippon Life can open to the increasingly
important Tokyo financial markets.
    "I think this, in all honesty, is a preliminary step," said
Long.
    "What you will see probably in the future is American
Express selling an additional 17 pct in the public market and
have a public vehicle for Shearson," Long said.
    "Normally, investors do not make a major capital commitment
into an illiquid situation," he said of Nippon.
    Some analysts previously speculated a 20 pct stake in
Shearson might be sold to the public. They said the firm, like
other investment banks, needs capital to expand globally.
    American express has said the total employees of shearson
will expand by 20 pct in 1987 internationally. However, that
number is substantially lower than growth last year, a company
spokesman said.
    American Express officials would not comment beyond a
statement made this morning. That statement, however, did not
close off the possibility of a public offering or other option
for Shearson.
    David Anthony, a Smith Barney analyst, said it is possible
Shearson would be partially sold to the public. But he believes
the firm will digest the Nippon investment first.
    "I think they'll figure out what they're going to do with
the money they have," he said.
    Joan Goodman, an analyst with Pershing and Co, also said
American Express could determine to sell shares to the public.
    In its statement, the financial services giant said it is
continuing to study various plans for Shearson in addition to
the investment by Nippon.
    American Express said options under study range from
expanding Shearson's capacity to meet international competition
to broadening its access to capital.
    American Express also said the options reflect the
continuing integral role of Shearson in American Express'
worldwide financial services strategy.
    Shearson follows Goldman, Sachs and Co in finding a
Japanese partner. Goldman last year sold a 12.5 pct stake to
Sumitomo Bank in exchange for a 500 mln dlr capital infusion.
    Analysts speculated there will be more such matches.
    "Those (U.S. brokers) companies have the expertise. They
don't have the money. There's just not enough internal capital
growth," said Wertheim analyst James Hanbury, who follows other
U.S. brokerage companies.
    Hanbury said some Japanese companies, flush with cash, are
interested in the expertise of American brokers. "Those
(Japanese) companies have the capital and our companies have
the capital needs and the growth opportunities to use the
money. That's a nice marriage," he said.
    Morgan Stanley and Co <MS> rose 4-1/4 to 74-7/8. First
Boston Corp <FBC> was up one to 51-1/4. E.F. Hutton Group <EFH>

obligatory, continuous rating for all Swiss franc bonds and
said he believed anyone buying more than five pct of a company
should be made to declare their share.
    In comments at a news conference of <Vontobel Holding AG>,
chairman Hans Vontobel said he believed it was up to the banks'
own self-regulating bodies, such as the Swiss Admissions Board,
to take such action before governmental bodies stepped in.
    A decline in the average quality of borrowers on the Swiss
franc market and a debate on the use of registered shares to
prevent takeovers have made both major issues among bankers.
    Vontobel noted that many borrowers already came to the
market with ratings from the major U.S. Agencies, which were
readily available to professionals through specialised
information systems.
    "We should make this classification obligatory and publish
it in places that are easily accessible to lay people," he said.
The quick changing nature of the financial market meant these
ratings should also be continually updated, he said.
    Vontobel also noted that recent years had seen companies,
worried about takeovers, increasingly issuing registered shares
and participation certificates rather than bearer shares.
    However, both types of issue had a drawback, he said. The
recent attempt by Jacobs Suchard AG <JACZ.Z> to take over Hero
Conserven Lenzburg <HERZ.Z> had shown the limits of a 1961
pledge by the banks not to sell registered shares to someone
who was not eligible according to the company's statutes.
    Excessive issue of participation certificates, which do not
carry voting rights, would also be contrary to the principle of
greater democracy in the new share law before Parliament.
    "People buying, for example, more than five pct of a
company's shares should be made to declare their purchase," he

completed the sale and leaseback of 30 pct of its 30 pct
interest in Unit One of the Perry Nuclear Power Plant,
receiving 509 mln dlrs for the interest.
    The utility said the share of its interest in the 1,205
megawatt generating plant was sold to a group of institutional
investors which leased it back to the company for a period of
about 29 years at a negotiated lease payment rate.
    Ohio Edison said the proceeds will be used to finance the
rest of its 1987 construction program and repay bank loans
incurred for the retirement of high-interest long-term debt.
    Ohio Edison did not detail the lease payments, but it said
the "payments will reduce the amount of revenue the company
will need to cover our investment in Perry, which translates
into savings for our customers."
    The utility said it projects the financing could reduce the
amount of annual revenue needed by about 20 mln dlrs. It plans
on filing a rate application with the Public Utilities
Commission of Ohio to recover the Perry costs later this year.
    It said the sale and leaseback was attractive to the
investors because they could take quicker advantage of tax

stakes in banks, but these should not constitute a "dominant"
holding, an Italian government committee ruled.
    The Interministerial Committee on Credit and Savings,
headed by Treasury Minister Giovanni Goria, said its decision
reflected the "need to safeguard the principle of separation
between banks and non-financial concerns."
    It did not quantify what might constitute a "dominant"
holding.
    The committee also set conditions for the allocation of
credits by banks to companies or individuals holding stakes in
them, and stipulates conditions under which the Bank of Italy
could exercise its powers of control in the case of stakes held
by banks in companies or other banks.
    Under the ruling, credits given by banks or their
subsidiaries to groups or individuals holding five pct or more
of the bank's capital must not exceed defined limits.
    The value of credits given cannot exceed either one-fifth
of the combined capital and reserves of the bank itself or
two-fifths of the value of the stake owned in the bank by the
group or individual concerned.
    Exceptions to these conditions include credits to concerns
in which the bank itself has a stake and to branches of foreign
banks. Credits made by foreign companies or banks to
subsidiaries which have their legal base in Italy will also be
excluded from the conditions.
    The Bank of Italy will request banks to insert rules in
their statutes to ensure that companies or individuals holding
five pct or more of the bank's capital are not given privileged
treatment with regard to credit allocation and terms.
    With regard to bank holdings in companies, the Bank of
Italy can exercise supervisory controls when information on a
bank's consolidated activities show single shareholdings in a
company or another bank of 25 pct or more, owned directly or
indirectly.
    Such controls can also be exercised even if the stake held
is below 25 pct if it can be considered a controlling interest.
    The controls will not be exercised in cases where the value
of the bank's stake in a concern is below the lesser of two
predefined limits.
    These limits are set at 15 billion lire or two pct of the
total assets of the parent company of the shareholding bank.

resisting attempts to merge two Japan-based telecommunications
firms in the hope that overseas political pressure will force a
change in those plans, a company executive said.
    Cable and Wireless, which holds a 20 pct stake in one of
the two Japanese firms, is opposed to plans to reduce its share
to three pct in the merged firm, director of corporate strategy
Jonathan Solomon told reporters.
    That plan, put forward by a senior member of the powerful
business organization Keidanren with the tacit backing of the
Post and Telecommunications Ministry, has caused a storm of
protest from abroad that Japan is seeking to exclude foreign
firms from a meaningful position in the market.
    Pacific Telesis Group <PAC.N> of the United States also
holds a 20 pct stake in one of the newly formed consortia,
<International Digital Communications Inc> (IDC).
    Solomon said that both British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher and U.S. Secretary of State George Schultz have
written to the Japanese government about the planned merger.
    A key U.S. Senate committee, Commerce Secretary Malcolm
Baldrige and Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter have also
expressed opposition to the merger, he said.
    The Post and Telecomunications Ministry reiterated again
that it sees no need for two competitors to <Kokusai Denshin
Denwa Co Ltd>, which holds a monopoly on international calls
from Japan. The ministry has also suggested that foreign
shareholders not hold managerial positions in the new firm.
    In an attempt to hammer out an agreement, Solomon today met
Fumio Watanabe, the senior Keidanren officer trying to arrange
the merger. But the two sides remained deadlocked.
    At stake is C and W's 400 mln dlr project to lay fibre
optic cables between Japan and Alaska, to form part of its
global network.
    "C and W wants to start right away on the project, such as
application and other procedures," said Watanabe, who is also
chairman of <Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Inc>. The Japanese
side is saying that the decision on such a plan should be left
with the new firm, after the merger.
    "These decisions (on the merger) were made in consideration
of Japan's economic conditions and legal systems. I told him we
are not a colony or something," said Watanabe.

about 500 mln dlrs in cash and another 1.50 billion dlrs in
available credit, which it intends to use to buy a
pharmaceutical company, Chairman Milan Panic said.
    At the company's annual meeting, he said an acquisition
could take place in the next 24 months.
    "The company has nearly two billion dlrs available for
acquisition today," Panic said, adding, "We are investigating a
number of companies." One company being studied could possibly
be acquired on a friendly basis, he said.
    Panic also said he intends to seek board approval today to
repurchase up to three mln ICN common shares.
    Discussing the possibility of an acquisition, Panic said
the such a purchase is necessary because ICN's current
marketing capability would not be sufficient to support
distribution of the company's products, given ICN's
expectations for market growth worldwide.
    ICN's principal product is ribavirin, also known as
Virazole. The drug is marketed in a number of countries and
described as a broad-based anti-viral.
    The company has said its possible applications include
treatment of some types of hepatitis, herpes, influenza,
childhood diseases and hemorrhagic fevers.
    ICN has been the focus of consirable investor attention in
recent months because of Virazole, which has undergone clinical
trials as a possible treatment of some AIDS-related diseases.
    Panic said today he would not discuss the drug with regard
to AIDS until the Food and Drug Administration completes its
review of data submitted by the company.
    He said an investigation of the drug being conducted by a
House Subcommittee is continuing.
    The subcommittee and the FDA have acknowledged they are
conducting separate investigations to determine whether or not
ICN witheld data from the FDA on adverse reactions to the drug.
    Virazole is approved for marketing in the U.S. in aerosol
form as a treatment for an infection that strikes infants,
called respiratory syncytial virus.

Australia Ltd>, has offered 3.8 billion pesos for 38 mln shares
in the Philippine brewing firm <San Miguel>, a Manila newspaper
reported.
    The Sunday Times quoted a letter sent yesterday to
President Corazon Aquino from Ariadne's chairman, New Zealander
Bruce Judge, that he was offering cash equivalent to five pct
of the nation's yearly budget to buy the shares from the
government.
    The presidential office and Ariadne representatives in
Manila were not available for comment on the report.
    The shares are the entire block seized by the government
from the United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB) on suspicion that
the real owner was Eduardo Cojuangco, the former chairman of
San Miguel and UCPB and a close associate of deposed president
Ferdinand Marcos.
    The 38 mln shares consist of 24 mln class A stock and 14
mln class B shares.
    Government officials have said earlier that the more
valuable class A shares would not be sold to foreigners.
    The offer values each share at 100 pesos -- the price at
which the Philippine Social Security System suggested it might
buy eight mln class A shares last week.
    "Judge's offer of 3.8 billion pesos is about five pct of the
Philippines' yearly budget," Ariadne's Philippine agent Domingo
Panganiban was quoted as telling reporters yesterday.
    "Mr Judge's objective in this investment is to make his
corporation's management expertise available to San Miguel so
that the company's assets can be fully utilised."
    San Miguel, the country's largest brewer, is also one of
the major manufacturers of grocery lines.
    Panganiban is quoted as saying that San Miguel could tap
food and liquor distribution lines in Australia, Britain, the
U.S., New Zealand and Hong Kong through <Barwon Farmlands Ltd>,
a listed Australian firm in which it has 30 pct equity.
    Ariadne, with about one billion dlrs in assets and turnover
of about two billion, has interests also in mining, real estate

    The Hong Kong Economic Journal quoted a spokesman of
Australian stock broker Jacksons Ltd as saying that <Barwon
Farmlands Ltd>, a listed Australian firm of which Ariadne owns
a 30 pct stake, is planning a branch in the Philippines.
    He added Jacksons is arranging an offer by Barwon to pay a
total 3.8 billion pesos in cash for 38 mln San Miguel shares.
    Barwon is offering 100 pesos each for 24 mln class A San
Miguel shares and 14 mln class B stock. But the Jacksons
spokesman noted that the more valuable A stock would only be
sold to Filipinos or companies registered in the Philippines.
    He said Barwon has approached the Philippine government
which seized the block of shares from the United Coconut
Planters Bank, which is believed to be linked with the
country's deposed President Ferdinand Marcos.
    He added he expects a deal to be concluded between Barwon
and the Philippine Government in 14 days as it is the only
offer in cash, the newspaper reported.
    Hong Kong Economic Journal also noted stock market rumours
that <Neptunia Corp>, a Hong Kong registered company which
controlled by San Miguel's president Andres Soriano, is the
other party keen on the block of San Miguel shares.
    The Philippine's Commission on Good Government ruled last
May against a move of Neptunia to acquire 33 mln San Miguel
shares controlled by the brewery firm's former chairman Eduardo
Cojuangco, who is also chairman of United Coconut.
    Commissioner Ramon Diaz said at the time the government
would not allow a subsidiary to buy into a parent firm, adding
San Miguel could have offered the shares to other parties.
    The Manila newspaper Sunday Times published a letter sent
yesterday to President Corazon Aquino from Ariadne's chairman,
New Zealander Bruce Judge, that he was offering cash equivalent

Supermarkets General Corp <SGL> it was flexible on the price it
would pay to acquire the company.
    Dart has said it would offer 41.75 dlrs cash for each SGL
share if the SGL board recommended the offer to shareholders.
    SGL has termed the 1.62 billion dlr offer unsolicited.
    In a letter to SGL dated March 20, Dart also said it was
denied confidential information on SGL that would be given to
other potential bidders.
    SGL officials could not be reached for comment.
    Dart said it was advised that a selling brochure for the
sale of SGL had been distributed to about 20 potential buyers,
but not itself. These purchasers would also be given access to
SGL's books and records and the opportunity to talk with key
employees.
    "We suspect that one or more of the 20 are leveraged buyout
firms," said a source close to Dart. Analysts have said SGL
management may be considering a leveraged buyout.
    Dart said it remains interested in acquiring SGL on a
friendly basis and reiterated its willingness to negotiate all
the terms of its offer.
    Dart said SGL representatives said the company has not
received any other offer.
    It said it requested the confidential information to better
understand SGL, but was denied this because it refused to sign
an agreement prohibiting it from making a bid for SGL without
SGL's approval.
    The agreement would also have limited its ability to buy
SGL shares, Dart said. It considered those conditions
unreasonable in the interest of trying to negotiate a friendly
transaction, it said.
    Dart has just under five pct of SGL shares.
    Dart said it requested the information before its meeting
with SGL representatives, but held the meetings in the hope
representatives would reach an agreement.
    It said it indicated it was flexible on price, but was told
there were certain issues important to SGL management and while
they were not conditions to the deal, Dart was expected to take
them into account in putting together its package.
    It said the issues include an immediate payment of 5.7 mln
dlrs to SGL chairman Leonard Lieberman, executive vice
president James Dougherty and financial officer Murray Levine.
    Dart said this payment was intended for the three officers'
severance agreements, although there was an implication that
Lieberman and Dougherty would be leaving the company of their
own volition.
    Dart said under their present agreements, none of these
officers have any right to such accelerated payments. Also,
Dart said Lieberman, Dougherty and Levine are to be paid 2.6
mln dlrs to pay their taxes. It also said top management's
incentive shares were to be accelerated and paid for at a cost
of six mln dlrs although there are restrictions on the shares
unless waived by the company's compensation committee.
    Dart said it was to fund up to five mln dlrs for top
management's supplemental retirement plan.
    Dart said another issue was to agree to future severance
obligations and future salary guarantees for top management,
estimated at more than 15 mln dlrs in excess of obligations
under the company's present policy.
    Dart said despite such management payments, it agreed to
discuss all aspects of its offer and in fact did try to
negotiate a transaction at the March 18 meeting with SGL.
    Supermarkets General owns the Path Mark supermarket chain
and Rickels home centres.
    Dart also released a copy of a lawsuit that was being filed
by an SGL shareholder, seeking to stop SGL from taking such
actions as paying greenmail or enacting a poison pill defence.
    The suit also sought to have directors carry out their
fiduciary duty.
    Greenmail is the payment at a premium for shares held by an
unwanted suitor and a poison pill is typically the issue of
securities to shareholders which make a takeover more
expensive.

that a joint venture would be formed or that Caesars would

International Inc's stock, even after Coca Cola Co took the
fizz out of market rumors by denying it was an interested
suitor.
    Wendy's retreated from an earlier high of 13-3/8, and lost
a point when Coca Cola <KO> said the rumors were untrue.
However, Wendy's remained up 5/8 at 12-3/8 on volume of more
than three mln shares.
    Several analysts were skeptical of the rumors, yet they
said they could not conclude a takeover of the fast food
restaurant chain was impossible.
    Wendy's declined comment on takeover rumors of all kinds.
Yet, a Wendy's spokesman said the company was aware of a
Business Week article, which named Coke as a potential suitor
and which market sources said helped ignite the rumor mill.
    Market sources mentioned Anheuser-Busch Inc <BUD> and
Pepsico Inc <PEP> as alternatives to Coke as acquirers. Neither
of those companies would comment, nor would the Wendy's
official.
    "It doesn't happen every day, every week, every month, but
its not unusual for us to be linked with those companies," said
Denny Lynch, Wendy's vice president of communications.
    However, Lynch would not comment specifically on the
current market rumors.
    Even before Coke denied the rumors, analysts had been
skeptical of a takeover since Atlanta-based Coke has stated it
views fast food chains as customers and does not want to become
a competitor to them.
    "I can't put another name on it," said Kidder peabody
analyst Jay Freedman as vaguer rumors continued to hold up
Wendy's stock. "It very well could be someone's interested."
    But Freedman said he doesn't believe now is the right time
for Wendy's to be sold.
    "They're obviously having operational difficulties. I've
always believed at the right price Wendy's would consider (an
offer), but I can't believe this is the right price at the
right time," Freedman said.
    "If a transaction takes place, the buyer's going to control
the situation," Freedman said.
    "I just don't think there's anything going on. I don't
think it's worth much more than where it is," said Joseph Doyle
of Smith Barney.
    Analysts said Wendy's has suffered largely from the "burger
wars" between itself, McDonald's Corp <MCD> and Pillsbury Co's
<PSY> Burger King chain. Wendy's, the third largest fast food
hamburger chain in the U.S., lost about 11 pct in same store
sales last year, analysts said.
    Wendy's also fumbled when it introduced a high-priced
breakfast, which it has since withdrawn, analysts said. Some
analysts said the company should be bringing in new products,
but it is too soon to predict a significant turnaround.
    There are analysts, however, who believe Wendy's may be
vulnerable to a takeover.
    James Murren of C.J. Lawrence said Wendy's could be worth
14 to 15 dlrs on a break-up basis. He said the company has
improved its debt-to-equity ratio and Wendy's owns a high
percent of its own restaurants - 38 pct of 3,500.
    "They also have some attractive leaseholds on their
restaurants," Murren said.
    Murren said that despite the downturn in sales last year,
Wendy's real sales, store for store, turned upwards in the
fourth quarter. "That was about the first time in seven
quarters," he said.
    Caroline Levy of E.F. Hutton also believes something could
be going on with Wendy's. "My gut feeling is something's going
to happen. I don't know what," she said.
    She estimated a takeover price would be at least 15 dlrs
per share.
    One analyst speculated that Coke became the rumored suitor
because Wendy's decided to sell Coke at its fountains instead
of Pepsi.
    Wendy's is currently embroiled in litigation brought by
Pepsi, which holds a contract with the company, analysts said.
Pepsi's soda is still sold in the Wendy's restaurants.

Holdings Plc said it was bidding 542.2 mln stg for the ordinary
shares of building products and packaging group Norcros Plc.
    The offer would be made on the basis of 29 new Williams
shares for every 50 in Norcros, or 432.7p a share
    Norcros shares firmed to 410p at 0914 GMT from a close last
night of 397p.
    A statement by Williams said it was confident of the merits
of the proposed merger and it had therefore taken care to
propose from the outset the right terms, including a full cash
alternative.
    The offer will include a partial convertible alternative
under which shareholders would receive up to a total of 205.69
mln new second convertible shares in Williams instead of their
ordinary share allocations.
    The offer for Norcros preferential shares offers one
Williams preferential share for each one of Norcros, for a
value of 130p each and a total of 2.9 mln stg.
    Last week Williams reported that pretax profits for 1986
rose to 22.9 mln stg from 6.3 mln.
    Speculation about a bid for Norcros had been circulating in
the market for several months, dealers said. Initially it
centred on <Bunzl Plc>, which once held a 2.6 pct stake, then
switched to Williams when it began accumulating shares.
    Earlier this year, Williams suggested holding talks with
Norcros on a possible merger but was rebuffed by Norcros which
replied that any benefits that could be achieved could also
result from normal trading.
    In the six months to end-September, Norcros reported a rise
in pretax profits to 20.14 mln stg from 18.55 mln on turnover
that lifted to 311.82 mln from 303.91 mln
    Williams Holdings began expanding from 1982 when it had a
market capitalisation of around one mln stg. A series of
acquisitions in the next four years has pushed its
capitalisation up to around 380 mln.
    The convertible offer would be on the basis of four
Williams convertibles for every Norcros share, worth 428p a
share. The cash alternative would offer the equivalent of
400.2p a share.
    The announcement of the bid pushed Williams share price
down to 733p from last night's close at 750p.
    Williams said it held a total 850,000 shares in Norcros, or
0.7 pct, while an associate held a further 1.99 mln or 1.6 pct.
    There was no immediate response from Norcros.

financial institutions," said Simon Smithson, an analyst with
Kleinwort Benson International Inc in Tokyo.
    The investment in Shearson Lehman, a growing firm described
by some analysts as the top U.S. Retail brokerage, will give
Nippon Life a ringside seat and possibly lower commissions on
Wall Street, where it invests an increasing percentage of its
assets of 90.2 billion dlrs, they said.
    Nippon Life staff will also acquire expertise in business
sectors which have not yet opened up in Japan, they added.
    The agreement between the two companies calls for a 50-50
joint venture in London focussing on investment advisory asset
management, market research, and consulting on financing.
    Nippon Life is Japan's largest insurance company and the
world's biggest institutional investor, analysts said.
    The Japanese finance ministry is expected to approve the
deal in April, making Nippon Life the first Japanese life
insurance firm to take a stake in a U.S. Financial firm.
    The limit on foreign assets as a proportion of Japanese
insurers' assets was increased to 25 pct from 10 pct last year.
Since then, they have stepped up purchases of foreign stocks
and sought to deepen their understandng of foreign markets and
instruments.
    Last year, a Sumitomo Life Insurance Co official was
appointed to E.F. Hutton Group Inc unit E.F. Hutton and Co's
board and Sumitomo Bank Ltd spent 500 mln dlrs to become a
limited partner in Goldman, Sachs and Co.
    Smithson said Japanese banks started buying smaller and
problem-plagued banks in 1984. "But now Japanese are going for
blue-chip organisations," he said.
    "It's a reflection of what has happened in manufacturing
industries," said Brian Waterhouse at James Capel and Co. "With a
historically high yen, and historically low interest rates,
there's an increasing disincentive to invest in Japan."
    Competition in fund management has grown along with greater
Japanese savings. The typical salaried employee has 7.33 mln
yen in savings, reflecting an annual average savings rate of 17
to 18 pct, he said.
    To stay competitive, fund managers must invest overseas and
gain experience with financial instruments which are likely to
spread to Japan with further deregulation. "The high regulatory
environment has delayed (life insurance firms')
diversification. Now there's a growing number of new products
in an environment of increasing competition for performance on
fund management," Smithson said.

share tender offer for Cyclops to eliminate two conditions and
modify a third one.
    The group, which includes Audio/Video Affiliates Inc and a
unit of Citicorp <CCI>, said it also obtained additional
financing commitments, including an increased commitment from
Citicorp Capital Investors Ltd.
    The conditions that were eliminated are Cyacq's request for
non-public information about Cyclops that was previously
provided to Dixons Group PLC and Cyacq's being satisified that
the information provides an adequate basis for Cyclop's
published financial projections.
    Cyclops has agreed to be acquired Dixons Group, which has a
90.25 dlrs a share tender offer for Cyclops outstanding. Dixons
said earlier it would allow the offer to expire tonight.
    The condition that was modified, which required Cyacq to be
satisfied that break up fees or other obligations to Dixons
were rescinded or ineffective, now says Cyclops shall not have
paid any such fees or expenses to Dixons prior to the
consummation of Cyacq's offer.
    Cyacq's amended offer expires midnight New York time on
April three, 1987, unless extended.
    Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co and CIT Group/Business
Credit Inc increased its tender offer commitment to 197 mln
dlrs from 166 mln dlrs and its merger commitment to 275 mln
dlrs from 250 mln dlrs.
    Additionally, the Citicorp unit and Audio/Video have
increased their commitments to Cyacq to 185 mln dlrs. Of the
new total, 150 mln dlrs has been committed by Citicorp.
    Cyacq said it estimates that it needs 407.5 mln dlrs to buy
all Cyclops shares that may be tendered and pay related fees
and expenses.
    It said it is seeking to arrange the balance of about 25.5
mln dlrs necessary to complete the offer.
    All previously announced conditions regarding the lending
group led by Manufacturers Hanover remain in effect, except
that the loans are subject to the concurrent receipt by Cyacq
of equity contributions and other financing of not less than
210.5 mln dlrs for the tender offer facility and 213.5 mln dlrs
for the merger facility.
    Cyacq also said the Citicorp unit had received no
indications of interest in an alternative offer it had made
from Dixons, Cyclops or Alleghany Corp <Y>, which has agreed to
acquire Cyclops' industrial group from Dixons.
    Under the alternative offer, the Citicorp unit, with

like an "appropriate price." Another said "it's too early to
project the outcome."
    "The market is speaking for itself and saying the 25 dlr
offer is inadequate," the second arbitrageur said. But he added
it was hard to make a case for Conrac being worth much more
than the 29 dlrs where the shares traded today.
    He noted the stock recently sold in the high teens and
there could be a downward risk of 10 dlrs or more if Conrac is
able to thwart Mark IV.
    Conrac urged shareholders to take no action while its board
studies the offer and confers with advisers. Conrac said it
would make a recommendation by April 17.
    A third arbitrageur noted Mark IV had been involved in
several takeovers previously and has proven itself to be a
determined bidder. "They're not beginners," he said.
    Another said Conrac might have trouble if it tried to find
another buyer. "It's a hodge-podge of non-related businesses,"
he said. "There is only a small universe of people who would
want to own the company as it's presently structured."
    Conrac is involved in video displays, computer software,
aircraft instruments, telephone answering machines, welding
equipment and other products.
    "I'm telling retail clients to sell and leave the rest for
those who can take the risk," said Rudolph Hokanson, analyst at
Milwaukee Co.
    He called the 25-dlr offer by Mark IV "fair value but on
the low side." "I don't think management was looking for a
buyer in any way before this offer," he said.
    Hokanson said Conrac has conservative finances and has
developed a reputation for quality products that serve niche
markets. He said management has done a good job of turning
around the telephone answering machine business.

said it received a proposal from <KSZ Co Inc> under which
holders of Resorts class B stock would receive 140 dlrs a share
in cash and one share of common stock in a new company to be
formed through the takeover.
    Under the offer, Resorts said holders of its class A shares
would receive 15 dlrs a share in cash and three shares of
common stock in the new company.
    Resorts said the offer from KSZ calls for a merger of
Resorts with RI Acquisition Co Inc, a newly formed Delaware
corporation.
    Resorts said that prior to the merger, RI Acquisition would
be capitalized with about 100 mln dlrs of debt and about 220
mln dlrs of equity.
    It said 200 mln dlrs of the equity would be in the form of
special preferred stock.
    The KSZ offer, Resorts said, indicates that KSZ has a
commitment from <M. Davies Cos> to buy all of the special
preferred stock.
    Resorts said the offer will expire at 1700 EST on March 27.
It said it asked its investment advisor, Bear, Stearns and Co,
to advise its board on the offer.
    Earlier this month, the estate of James M. Crosby and
certian members of his family agreed to sell their class B
shares to New York real estate tycoon Donald Trump for 135 dlrs
a share. The estate and family members hold 78 pct of the
752,297 class B shares outstanding.
    Trump also agreed to pay 135 dlrs a share for the remaining
class B shares outstanding.
    Resorts also has about 5,680,000 shares of outstanding
class A stock. These shares carry one one-hundredth the voting
power of the class B shares.
    Trump's offer beat out a rival bid of 135 dlrs a share made
by Pratt Hotel Corp <PRAT>.
    Resorts said that under the proposal made by KSZ, existing
class A and class B shareholders would control about 96 pct of
the outstanding common of the new company formed to acquire
Resorts.
    Resorts said the new company, upon completion of the
merger, would hold the 220 mln dlrs of debt and that the
special preferred stock would immediately be converted into
exchangeable participating preferred of the new company.
    This preferred, Resorts said, would pay a dividend based on
the net cash flows from the new company's Paradise Island
operations.
    A Resorts spokesman said the KSZ offer was made in a
two-page letter and that Resorts could not comment on it
because it did not contain enough information. Resorts has
asked Bear, Sterns to obtain complete data, he said.
    The spokesman said Resorts is not familiar with KSZ but
that it believes the company is controlled by Marvin Davis, the
Denver oilman.
    Calls to Davis were referred to Lee Solters, who handles
public relations for Davis. Solters, said to be travelling, was
not immediately available for comment.

large, multi-store operations, and the largest sell more than 1
billion dlrs a year worth of vehicles a year.
    Around the auto industry there is talk of mergers and
buyouts among dealerships, and there are rumors that the
largest are considering offering shares to the public, analysts
say.
    Retail car sales "are at a point of transition. There's not
much that's off the table in terms of creative thinking" about
ways to sell cars, says David Cole, analyst with the University
of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute.
    The retail car market is "much more freeform now" than it
was in 1956, the year things began to change, says Detroit
analyst Arvid Jauppi of Arvid Jauppi and Associates.
    Thirty years ago, in 1956, the situation was different.
Dealerships sold one kind of car--a "Chevy" or a Ford or a
Studebaker. The average dealer had 17 employees and sold
738,000 dlrs worth of vehicles, according to the National
Automobile Dealers Association.
    That year a tiny car from overseas--Germany's Volkswagen
Beatle--began to gain popularity. The "Bug" caused "a
rebellion" among dealers, who demanded greater freedom from
restrictions placed on them by the major American automakers,
says Jauppi.
    One of the most visible changes in retail car sales has
been in the size of dealerships, auto analysts say. Last year,
the average dealership had 11.2 mln dlrs in sales--a 15-fold
increase from 1956--and employed 34 workers.
    "I had one of these guys tell me he makes six, seven mln
dlrs a year and didn't know what to do with all his money,"
says Cole.
    "There's a whole lot more rich guys who sell cars than that
make cars," he says.
    With the increase in size, large dealers have been buying
up other dealerships, and auto analysts see few signs the trend
will let up.
    Donald Keithley, vice president, dealer services, for J.D.
Power, a California-based market research firm, says that, by
1990, 12,000 people will own dealerships compared to 16,800
principal owners today.
    Many dealers are experimenting with owning several
franchises, some of which might compete against each other. "It
used to be a Chevrolet dealer was a Chevrolet dealer. Now a
Chevrolet dealer might handle several lines," Jauppi says.
    As dealers get bigger, industry officials are talking about
the possibility that some of them might become publicly-owned
or open international operations.
    Offering shares to the public is an option large dealers,
"are obviously thinking of very seriously," says Cole.
    Although some say the franchise system might get in the way
of a public offering, Jauppi says there are few obstacles to
trading in car dealer shares.
    "Dealers are large enough now to go public. The only thing
the manufacturer cares about is that the dealer sells those
cars. It could happen any time," Jauppi says.
    "If you look at the whole merger mania, and look at the
scale some of these dealers, it's going to be very hard to
resist taking them public," said another analyst.
    And Jauppi says that dealerships can be expected to become
international.
    "We're going to have international dealers--dealer networks
that are worldwide," he says. U.S. dealers will be attracted
particularly to Europe, where the market will expand faster
than the U.S., he says.
    "It's not totally off the wall," says Cole.

    When CPC announced the agreement yesterday in New York, it

    Ferruzzi said the deal is subject to agreement on several
clauses of the contract and needs government authorisations.
    It said the deal would involve 13 starch factories
employing about 5,000 people in eight European Community
countries plus facilities and commercial operations in other EC
states.
    The factories have a capacity to produce the equivalent of
1.6 mln tonnes of starch in starch and by-products a year, or
about one third of EC production, from about 2.7 mln tonnes of
cereals.
    Ferruzzi said the acquisition of these assets would extend
its presence in the European agro-industrial industry both
geographically and in terms of products.
    It said it is already the principal EC producer of sugar
and of soya oil and cake, and the major cereal trader.
    It noted that EC output of isoglucose is subject to maximum
quotas, of which CPC currently holds a 25 pct share, and said
it foresaw an increase in other industrial uses of starch in
the future, notably in the production of ethanol for fuel.

    Sharp shareholders will be offered cash, shares or a

    Dixons initially ended its 90.25 dlr a share tender offer

backed a variety of restraints on insider trading and hostile
corporate takeovers and asked Congress to define insider
trading in law.
    The industry trade association called on U.S. securities
firms to take steps to protect sensitive corporate secrets to
guard against illegal trading by employees.
    The association also backed broad federal restrictions on a
variety of tactics used in hostile corporate takeovers.
    But it said investment banking firms should be allowed to
continue to engage in both arbitrage and merger and acquisition
activities so long as those functions were kept separate.
    The SIA, in a report adopted yesterday by its board of
directors, backed a higher enforcement budget for the federal
Securities and Exchange Commission and called on U.S. stock
exchanges to beef up their supervision of member brokerages.
    The report said securities firms "should be more rigorous in
restricting sensitive information on a need-to-know basis."
    It said firms should train their employees to understand
the need for confidentiality of market-sensitive information.
    It said legislation to define insider trading should avoid
expanding current law in a way that would impede the market.
    It said an insider trading definition should exempt a
securities firm from liability for law violations by its
employees unless the firm had participated in or was aware of
the wrongdoing.
    In the mergers and acquisitions area, the association
advocated a ban on greenmail payments or poison pill takeover
protection plans without prior shareholder approval.
    It said a group or individual buying up a company's stock
should be required to file a public disclosure statement before
acquiring more than five pct of the company's shares. Under
current law, disclosure may be made as late as ten days after
exceeding the five pct limit.
    The association said all purchases exceeding 20 pct of a
company's voting stock shouls be made only through a tender
offer open to all shareholders. Under current law there is no
limit on open market purchases.
    The group said the federal government should preempt state
regulation of defensive takeover tactics.
    The group said all tender offers should remain open for at
least 30 calendar days.
    The current requirement is expressed in business days.
    It said so-called "lockup" devices, in which securities are
issued to a friendly investor to seal a takeover deal or fend
off an unfriendly predator should be limited to 18.5 pct of the
target company's total common stock.
    Association president Edward O'Brien said the group acted
out of concern over the ad hoc restructuring of corporate
America on Wall Street and investor fears about insider trading
and fairness in the marketplace.

said it is ready to promptly purchase the Southern Pacific
Transportation Co from Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp <SFX> if
the Interstate Commerce Commission rejects Sante Fe's attempt
to reopen the merger of Southern and the Atchison, Tokepa and
Santa Fe Railway.
    In a filing with the ICC late today, the company outlined
four conditions of its offer to acquire Southern Pacific.
    Among the conditions are that Santa Fe enter into an
agreement to indemnify Kansas City for any contigent liabilites
of Southern Pacific existing as of the closing date, and that
the financial condition of Southern remain largely unchanged
from today onward.
    "We are willing, even eager, to make a fair market value
offer in cash for the Southern Pacific," said Kansas City
Southern president and chief executive officer Landon H.
Rowland.
    "This offer disproves the constant derogation of the
Sourthern Pacific by SFSP management, best exemplified by SFSP
Chief Executive John Schmidt's comment in ICC hearings that the
Southern Pacific was 'bankrupt,'" said Rowland.
    He said that merging Southern with Kansas City will achieve
the benefits of an end-to-end merger while preseving the
independece of the Southern Pacific versus its existing prime
competitor, Santa Fe.
    Kansas said that Southern's management had estimated the
value of the railroad in 1983 in the range of 281 mln dlrs to
1.2 billion dlrs.
    It said that Morgan Stanley and Co Inc and Salomon Brothers
Inc, hired in 1983 to advise Southern and Santa Fe in their
merger, appraised Southern as worth between 500 mln dlrs and
800 mln dlrs less than Southern's own internal valuations.
    Kanasa City Southern said it will make an offer for
Southern after its books, records and properties are examined.
    "Once that examination has been completed (and even in the
absence of a willingnes of SFSP to negotiate) KCSI will make an
offer in writing...." said the company.
    Kansas also said it argued in the ICC filing that Santa Fe
had not met the legal requirements justifying the Commission's
reconsideration of the proposed merger of Santa Fe and Southern
Pacific, two railroads that it said basically parallel each
other throughout their routes.
    ICC voted four to one last summer to reject the merger as
inherently anticompetitive. Kansas said Santa Fe in petitioning
for reconsideration now argues that the trackage agreements
with the Union Pacific, the Denver and Rio Grande Western and
other railroads, adds to the value of the merger.

"was not interested in sitting down and talking with us at this
time." Cyril Wagner sought the meeting in a recent telephone
conversation with Reynolds, Reed said.
    Wagner and Brown, along with AFG Industries Inc <AFG>,
recently launched a surprise tender offer for GenCorp. The
offer is worth 2.23 billion dlrs.
    Reed said under the circumstances the 100 dlr per share
tender offer, which expires April 15, is a fair offer. GenCorp
gained 3-1/2 to 114 today on the NYSE.
    Reed outlined a plan to reshape GenCorp in the event his
group wins control. He said aerospace, soft drink bottling and
entertainment units are potential divestiture candidates. He
said the tire business, which the group wants to keep, may be
more viable if merged with another tire company.
    "One option would be to try to grow the tire business
through combination or an acquisition," Reed said. He said he
believes such a merger could create a stronger force in the
tire industry.
    Gary Miller, chief financial officer of AFG, said his
company has a record of acquiring mature businesses and
boosting productivity. Automation and incentives tied to profit
sharing have been used with success, he said.
    In the case of GenCorp's RKO General broadcasting stations,
Reed said the plan of the partners is to step into GenCorp's
shoes and proceed with plans to  sell the stations.
    The partners said if they succed in acquiring GenCorp they
intend to consummate sale of WOR-TV in New York to MCA Inc
<MCA>. GenCorp last year entered into an agreement to sell the
station for 387 mln dlrs.
    The partners also said if they acquire Gencorp they would
also proceed with the proposed sale of KHJ-TV in Los Angeles to
Walt Disney Co <DIS>. RKO General would receive 217 mln dlrs
and Fidelilty Television, which challenged the license, would
get about 103 mln dlrs.
    The partners also said the Federal Communications
Commission established an expedited schedule for receiving
comments on their request for special temporary authorization
of proposed trust arrangements while the FCC considers a formal
application for transfer of the broadcast unit.
    Reed said he was pleased with the expedited schedule
because it provides time for the agency to act on the request
before the expiration of the tender offer.
    He said it was the aim of the partners to move as quickly
as possible to eliminate uncertainty surrounding the stations.
    Asked about criticism of the takeover attempt voiced by
some municipal officials in Akron, Ohio, where GenCorp is
headquartered, Reed said, "the plan of the partners offers long
term growth for Ohio."
    He noted that the aerospace business, slated for
divestiture under the partners' plan, is located in California.
"Our program is one that overall would provide the greatest
long term growth for all segments," he said.

intended to make a tender offer for the 45 pct of Standard Oil
Co <SRD.N> it does not already own at 70 dlrs a share cash, for
a total of 7.4 billion if the offer is fully accepted.
    The offer would be made through its <BP North America Inc>
unit and was intended to commence not later than April 1. The
offer would not be conditional on any minimum number of shares
being tendered.
    BP said in a statement the 70 dlr a share price was based
on its own valuation as well as those of its financial
advisers. It took into account reviews of both public and
non-public information.
    Standard closed in New York last night at 64-7/8 dlrs, down
1-3/4 dlrs.
    BP shares dropped on the announcement to 877p from 888p at
last night's close.
    About a third of the cash payable would be met from BP's
own resources.
    The remainder would come from new borrowings, partly from
banks under a four-year committed revolving credit facility and
partly from a a new U.S. Dlr commercial paper programme. The
company said it was in the course of arranging these
facilities.
    BP Chairman Sir Peter Walters said that the group's
investment in Standard was its largest single asset. Full
ownership would enable investment and operating decisions to be
made without the limitations of a minority interest.
    BP also believed the acquisition represented the optimum
use of its financial resources. It was confident oil prices
were likely to remain within a range sufficient to justify the
investment.
    Walters added that it also felt that, due to management
changes in 1986, Standard could now operate successfully even
in a lower oil price environment.
    Standard's net assets at end-1986 were 7.02 billion dlrs
and in the year it reported a loss of 1.08 billion dlrs before
tax and before an extraordinary item of 608 mln dlrs.
    Analysts said that the move by BP had come as a surprise.
One noted that it was not immediately clear why the group
should spend so much money buying a company it already
controlled.
    BP could also have bought up the remainder of Standard
shares considerably cheaper had it moved six months ago.
    It was also unclear what effect the tender would have on
the U.K. Government's recent announcement that it intended to
dispose of its remaining 31.7 pct stake in BP sometime in the
1987/88 financial year, analysts said.
    Analyst Paul Spedding of brokers Kleinwort Grieveson noted
that any effect on the government sale of its stake in BP would
depend on the reaction of the markets.
    The deal would probably push BP's gearing up to around 59
pct from 20 pct currently, he said.
    However, with the likelihood that oil prices would not
repeat last year's rapid drop the prospects for Standard
returning to profitability this year -- and BP benefitting from
its cash flow -- were good.
    Standard was a high cost oil producer, the analysts noted.
    Spedding noted that it needed about 12 dlrs a barrel to
make money, and at about 15 dlrs a barrel revenue from
production and its downstream activities would push it
comfortably into surplus.
    BP initially took a stake in Standard following the
discovery of oil in Alaska's Prudhoe bay in 1969. BP had
inadequate distribution facilities in the U.S. While Standard,
which was strong on marketing and refining, was short on crude
oil.
    The analysts said that BP had promoted a major management
reorganisation of Standard in the past year.
    The probability that much of the shake-up at Standard was
now complete was one possible factor behind the timing of the
tender offer, Spedding said.
    BP's willingness to take hard decisions such as major
balance sheet write offs and the sale of assets had been well
received in the markets.
    The lower costs that should now be possible -- especially
after the rationalisation of the loss making minerals division
-- should allow the benefits of an oil price recovery to come
straight through to 1987 profits without being cut back by
other sectors.

are seeking a five billion dlr, four year syndicated credit
facility in support of British Petroleum Co Plc's tender offer
for the 45 pct of Standard Oil Co it does not already own,
Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York said as arranger.
    The facility, to be guaranteed by British Petroleum Co Plc
<BP.L> is probably the largest credit facility ever arranged in
Europe, bond analysts said. Full terms will be announced either
later today or tomorrow morning. BP said earlier it planned a
tender offer for the 45 pct of Standard it does not already own
for 70 dlrs a share cash.
    The financing being arranged by Morgan Guaranty will take
the form of a fully committed revolving credit. As announced
earlier, BP also is arranging a U.S. Commercial paper program
in connection with the tender and part of the revolver will be
used to support that program.
    The exact size of the U.S. Program has not been decided and
the dealers have not yet been chosen.
    The credit facility will also allow the borrower to issue
cash advances with maturities of one, three or six months
through a tender panel, which will be comprised of banks
committed to the facility.
    Despite the unprecedented size of this euromarket facility,
Morgan Guaranty said that it was being syndicated only among
BP's relationship banks.
    As a result, banks were being offered lead manager status
at 200 mln dlrs, co-lead management at 125 mln and manager at
75 mln.
    Although pricing on many credit facilities has become
extremely fine in recent years because of the keen competition
to win mandates, Morgan Guaranty said banks would be
compensated fairly since this is a special purpose facility
which must be completed quickly, with signing expected in about
10 days.

    The French government, which owns CGCT, had asked Siemens

    Baur said Siemens had first made an offer last summer.

 ]]></BODY><BODY><![CDATA[Less than two months after First
Interstate Bancorp withdrew its bold attempt to buy BankAmerica
Corp, Chairman Joseph Pinola is still looking for a good buy,
but he is also looking at ways to avoid being bought.
    In a wide-ranging interview, Pinola said he's looking for
ways to improve profitability and capital between now and 1991,
"so as to resist any potential look at us...to maintain our
independence, if possible."
    In 1991 federal regulatory changes will allow the major
East Coast banks to buy banks in California.
    First Interstate, the fourth largest California bank, and
the nineth largest nationwide, owns 24 banks in 12 western
states and has franchise operations in four additional states.
    Bank industry sources say it is an attractive target for
large U.S. or foreign banks, looking to quickly move into the 
lucrative California market and the West Coast region.
    While declining specifics on his corporate strategy, when
asked if acquisitions will be part of the plan, Pinola replied,
"That's undoubtedly a fair statement...it would be almost naive
not to think that."
    Pinola characterized his acquisition strategy as
"opportunistic".
    He said he will look for banks in management trouble that
he can get at a bargain, then add management to restore
profitability, or for banks in states where First Interstate
already operates, then cut costs by combining resources.
    The exception, he said, would be Texas, where he said most
of the banks are already well managed, but might be purchased
at a discount because of the depressed regional economy.
    Pinola declined comment on what circumstances might move
him to rekindle his bid for BankAmerica, saying only, "We
continue to monitor and look at a lot of things and a lot of
people continue to monitor and look at us."
    Banking analysts, however, consider another First
Interstate bid at BankAmerica a long shot, not likely to happen
any time soon.
    Pinola called his decision last month to withdraw his 3.25
billion dlr bid at the nation's second largest bank, "a very,
very difficult decision."
    With that decision made, however, he acknowledged First
Interstate may now have a difficult time keeping its number
four position in the California banking community.
    "The competition in this state is tough," he said, noting
CityBank's recent purchase of 50 financial service branches
from Sears Roebuck company. "CityBank is moving rapidly to move
us down to fifth and Wells Fargo down to fourth," he said.
    Outside California, Pinola acknowledged that Security
Pacific Corp, with its recent acquisitions in Arizona,
Washington and Oregon, is quickly becoming a regional
competitor in areas where First Interstate has long dominated.
    "Security is, has been and continues to be a highly
profitable and obviously well managed company," he said.
    He added, however, First Interstate, at the moment, has the
advantages of having owned and managed regional banks longer
and has the recognition advantage of having given its regional
banks a common name.
    Pinola said while its coastal state banks are in good
financial condition, First Interstate continues to sustain
serious loan losses in its Rocky Mountain states, where energy,
real estate and agriculture dominate the economy.
    Asked if he thought loan losses in those areas had peaked,
he said, "I don't think it has bottomed out, because I think
most of the problems are real estate-related and the real
estate problems are going to be with us for several years."
    Pinola said another failing economic sector, agriculture in
the Midwest, has slowed expansion of First Interstate's
franchise operation.
    First Interstate has 42 franchise banks that offer First
Interstate financial services in ten states.
    While a year ago he was considering taking his franchise
operation east of the Mississippi River, Pinola said because
most of the franchise banks are now in the West, expansion into
the Midwest must come first.
    Calling the franchise system, "moderately profitable,"
Pinola said, "It is going to take a rejuvenation of the
agriculture sector for us to commence franchising at the speed
we were generating before the last year or two."
    On the banking industry in general, Pinola said he thinks
1987 will be another bad year for loan losses, with only banks
with minimal holdings in real estate able to improve profits.

Robert Heller said the banking system could be strengthened by
permitting formation of financial services holding companies
involved in areas like banking, insurance, real estate and
securities.
    In a speech prepared for delivery in New York to the Bank
and Financial Analysts' Association, Heller said, "I believe
that increased diversification along geographic and product
lines is the key to strengthening the American banking system."
    He said he supported the idea of financial services holding
companies advocated by the Association of Bank Holding
Companies in which regulation of various bank, thrift,
insurance, investment, securities and real estate subsidiaries
would be handled on functional lines.
    "Limits would be placed on the extension of credit by the
bank to the associated institutions, and all transactions would
have to be on an arms-length basis," Heller said.
    Measures would be necessary to avoid abuse of the banks'
special position by such holding companies or subsidiaries.
    Heller said he "would require the holding company to serve
as a 'source of strength' to the bank by making a commitment to
maintain the bank's capital.
    "In other words, the bank would not be allowed to fail as
long as the holding company has a positive net worth."
    Heller also said commercial enterprises should be permitted
to own a financial services holding company, again with the
provision that capital would flow to the financial enterprise
if necessary.
    Heller said the effects of these actions "would be banks
that are at least as strong as the corporations holding them" in
which customer deposits were assured while any incentive to
"loot the bank" was removed.
    Such diversification would give access to national and
international financial services to corporations across the
United States.
    Heller said that would mean "the steady decline of America's
banks in the world financial league tables would be arrested" by
permitting them to become more competitive.

not trying to keep foreign equity in a new Japanese
international telecommunications company below the legal limit
of 33 pct, a Post and Telecommunications ministry official
said.
    In a letter sent yesterday, Postal Minister Shunjiro
Karasawa told U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige that the
ministry does not object to foreign participation by those U.S.
Firms that have expressed interest.
    But it does oppose any foreign international
telecommunications carrier having a management role, he said.
    The move appears to be an effort to dampen U.S. Opposition
to the planned merger of two rival firms seeking to compete
with the current monopoly <Kokusai Denwa Denshin Co Ltd>, and
to reduce the share held in any KDD rival by U.K.'s Cable and
Wireless Plc <CAWL.L>, industry analysts and diplomats said.
    One of the rival firms, <International Telecom Japan Inc>
(ITJ) has offered a stake in the company to eight U.S. Firms
including General Electric Co <GE>, Ford Motor Co <F> and
Citibank NA <CCI), and two European companies, ITJ president
Nobuo Ito said yesterday.
    Cable and Wireless holds a 20 pct share in a second
potential KDD rival, <International Digital Communications
Planning Inc>, along with <C Itoh and Co>. Merrill Lynch and Co
Inc <MER> and Pacific Telesis International Inc <PAC>, both of
the U.S., Hold three and 10 pct shares respectively.
    The Post and Telecommunications Ministry has urged the
merger of the two firms because it says the market can only
support a single KDD competitor.
    It has also rejected management participation by an
international common carrier, such as Cable and Wireless,
arguing no international precedent for such a stake exists.
    Cable and Wireless Director of Corporate Strategy, Jonathan
Solomon, yesterday again told ministry officials he opposes a
merger proposal that would limit Cable and Wireless' share to
less than three pct and total foreign participation to about 20
pct, the ministry official said.
    Channeling the U.S. Firms into a single merged competitor
would most probably result in diluting Cable and Wireless'
share, industry analysts said.
    "Eventually the ministry will get what it wants -- one
combined competitor," Bache Securities (Japan) Ltd analyst
Darrell Whitten said.
    "Political ... Leverage may get the total foreign share up
to a certain amount, but you won't find any one company with an
extraordinarily large holding," Whitten said.
    Western diplomatic sources were more blunt.
    "They (the ministry) don't want to see Cable and Wireless
with a reasonable share and they think of all sorts of
strategies to reduce that share," one said.
    Fumio Watanabe, a senior Keidanren (a leading business
organization) official who has been trying to arrange the
merger, will present a new outline of his proposal on Thursday,
the ministry official said.

    Honeywell said it will use much of the money to reduce
short-term debt incurred last December when the company
purchased the Sperry Aerospace Group.

computer company jointly owned by Bull, NEC and Honeywell.
    The new privately held company, named Honeywell Bull, is
42.5 pct owned by Honeywell Inc, 42.5 pct by Bull and 15 pct by

controls for buildings, industry, aerospace and defense,
Honeywell is now focusing its management, technical and

said.
    Honeywell said it expects to be Honeywell Bull's largest
customer, purchasing computers for its own internal data
processing, for integration into Honeywell buidling and
industrial automation systems and for resale to the U.S.

Honeywell Federal Systems Inc.

operation in 1986, and will account for its future interest on

Transportation (DOT) said it gave final clearance to the
proposed 225 mln dlr acquisition of AirCal Inc by American
Airlines Inc.
    "The acquisition is not likely to substantially lessen
competition or to be inconsistent with the public interest," the
DOT said in a statement.
    AirCal is a unit of ACI Holdings Inc while American is a
unit of AMR Corp.
    The DOT had given tentative approval to the merger plan
Feb. 20.
    American is the third largest U.S. airline in terms of
revenue passenger miles while AirCal--a relatively small
carrier that primarily serves West Coast cities--is the
nation's 17th largest passenger carrier. Their merger would not
alter American's third-place ranking, according to data
compiled by Aviation Daily, a leading industry trade magazine.
    The combination would incrase American's share of the U.S.
market to 15.4 pct from its current 14.7 pct, the DOT said.
    The DOT said the merger was unlikely to substantially
reduce competition on the four routes on which both carriers
provide either nonstop or single-plane service.
    At 13 of the 14 terminals served by both carriers, the DOT
said it found no evidence that other carriers could not
increase or begin service that competed with a merged
American-AirCal.
    Concerning the 14th, "While entry may not be possible at the
Orange County Airport in the near future, DOT found that the
service provided at other airports in the Los Angeles area,
especially at the Los Angeles International Airport, will
provide effective competition for Orange County travelers in
long-haul markets," the DOT said.
    The merger would give American control of 37 pct of the
authorized takeoff and landing slots at the Orange County
terminal, where environmental concerns and a small terminal
building limit future opportunities for expansion.
    The DOT said the Air Line Pilots Association filed comments
opposing the merger but "raised no new facts or arguments."
    Under the merger terms, announced Nov. 17, American will
pay 15 dlrs a share for the outstanding stock of ACI Holdings.

shareholders to reject the hostile unsolicited 100 dlr a share
tender offer made March 18 by General Acquisition Inc, an
affiliate of Wagner and Brown and AFG Industries INc.
    Gencorp also said it is developing a financially superior
alternative that would enable shareholders to benefit from the
full value of the company.
    In a letter to shareholders, Chairman A. William Reynolds 
said the offer is a "highly conditional, contingently financed
bust-up offer" that seeks to deny shareholders the true value
of their investment in Gencorp.
    Reynolds said the board reached its decision to reject the
offer after careful study with legal and financial advisers. He
said the board has authorized management to explore
alternatives aimed at providing shareholders with a
"financially superior" alternative to the general acquisition
offer.
    A Gencorp spokesman, in response to questions, would not
comment on market speculation that the company's management may
develop a leveraged buyout offer of its own. He would also not
comment on when a better alternative might be developed.
    Gencorp's stock has traded well above the 100 dlr offer
price since the tender was made. Today, Gencorp closed at
114-1/4, up 1-5/8.
    Reynolds said in the letter that for the last few years,
Gencorp management has taken action to enhance shareholder
value, and the stock price and earnings have improved since he
joined the company.
    Gencorp said the partnership's offer is a "bargain price"
acquisition that was "using financing from a syndicate of banks
that does not yet exist and a bridge loan from Shearson Lehman
brothers that shearson is not obligated to provide."
    Reynolds also said the offer would result in a radical
alteration and selloff of Gencorp's assets, including Aerojet
General to refinance General Acquisition's borrowings with the
profits going to Wagner and Brown and AFG instead of
shareholders.
    The letter also said the General Acquisition offer
"jeopardizes the security and interests" of its shareholders,
employees, customers, suppliers and the communities throughout
the country where the company's facilities are located.

 ]]></BODY><BODY><![CDATA[General Acquisition Co said it was
disappointed by Gencorp's response to its tender offer and
questioned how the company might give better value to
shareholders.
    Gencorp earlier urged shareholders to reject a 100 dlr per
share tender offer from the partnership, which includes Wagner
and Brown and AFG Industries Inc. The company said it was
studying financially superior alternatives.
   The partnership called the response inflammatory and
unproductive, particularly since it had attempted to discuss
the offer with Gencorp.
     The partnership said Gencorp failed to say how it would
provide a "superior value yet they continue their attempt to
prevent a satisfactory offer by failing to redeem their poison
pill." Poison pills are shareholder rights plan that make
takeovers more expensive.
    Gencorp said in its statement earlier that the date its
rights will trade separately from the common stock was extended
to April six from April three. It said the extension was
subject to further extensions by the board and is conditioned
on no person aquiring beneficial ownership of 20 pct or more of
Gencorp prior to April six.
    General Acquisition said it is confident its offer can be
completed in a timely manner using its financial arrangements.
    The partnership in its statement again urged management to
work with it to facilitate a transaction.

unit <Esso Exploration and Production Australia Inc> said CSR
has agreed to sell its <Delhi Australia Fund> (DAF) to Esso for
985 mln Australian dlrs.
    The sale is effective from tomorrow, they said in a joint
statement.
    The previously announced float of part of its Delhi
interest will not now proceed, CSR said in the statement.
    Delhi Australia Fund owns <Delhi Petroleum Pty Ltd>, which
holds an average of 25 pct in the Santos Ltd <STOS.S>-led
Cooper and Eromanga Basin gas and liquids projects.
    In addition to the purchase price, CSR will share equally
in any returns due to increases in crude oil and condensate
prices over certain levels for liquids produced from Delhi's
interests in the next two years, the statement said.
    "The Esso proposal to purchase all the Delhi interest will
be more beneficial to our shareholders than proceeding with the
float," CSR chief executive Bryan Kelman said in the statement.
    Kelman said the sale of Delhi would enable CSR to focus
efforts on expanding business areas such as sugar and building
materials in which CSR has had long and successful management
experience and strong market leadership.
    With the sale, CSR will be able to expand those businesses
more aggressively and earlier, he said.
    As reported separately, soon after announcing the Delhi
sale CSR launched a takeover bid for the 68.26 pct of <Pioneer
Sugar Mills Ltd> that it does not already hold, valuing its
entire issued capital at 219.6 mln dlrs.
    After Bass Strait, the onshore Cooper and Eromanga Basin is
Australia's largest oil and gas producing area with current
gross oil production of 45,000 barrels per day (BDP), gas
liquids output of 30,000 BPD and gas sales of 480 mln cubic
feet a day, the CSR-Esso statement said.
    The purchase gives Esso, a 50/50 partner with The Broken
Hill Pty Co Ltd <BRKN.S> in the Bass Strait, its first onshore
production in Australia, they said.
    Esso's chairman Stuart McGill said he hoped Esso can assist
in maintaining the high rate of oil and gas discoveries in the
Cooper-Eromanga area.
    "These discoveries will help Australia's self-sufficiency in
oil reserves thereby offsetting in part the decline in Bass
Strait production now under way," McGill said.
    In a separately released letter to CSR shareholders, Kelman
said CSR was within days of completing plans for the float of
CSR Petroleum when it received an offer from Esso.
    He said CSR is convinced the sale was the correct decision
in view of the risks associated with the oil business.
    The price-sharing arrangement provides for CSR to share
equally with Esso in higher returns if oil prices average more
than 20 U.S. Dlrs a barrel in the next two years, he said.
    Kelman said a revaluation of CSR's investment in Delhi to
net realisable value as of today, CSR's annual balance-date,
will result in an extraordinary loss of 97 mln dlrs.
    However, revaluations and profits on sales of other assets
will significantly reduce this loss, he said.
    He also said that CSR is sufficiently encouraged by future
prospects and the opportunity to reposition the group in core
businesses to foreshadow an increase in final dividend payable
in July to 10 cents from nine to make an annual 19 cents
against 18 in 1985/86.

holds an average of 25 pct in the Santos Ltd <STOS.S>-led
Cooper and Eromanga Basin gas and liquids projects.
    In addition to the purchase price, CSR will share equally
in any returns due to increases in crude oil and condensate
prices over certain levels for liquids produced from Delhi's
interests in the next two years, the statement said.
    "The Esso proposal to purchase all the Delhi interest will
be more beneficial to our shareholders than proceeding with the
float," CSR chief executive Bryan Kelman said in the statement.
    Kelman said the sale of Delhi would enable CSR to focus
efforts on expanding business areas such as sugar and building
materials in which CSR has had long and successful management
experience and strong market leadership.
    With the sale, CSR will be able to expand those businesses
more aggressively and earlier, he said.
    As reported separately, soon after announcing the Delhi

dlrs cash each for the shares it does not already hold in
<Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd>.
    CSR already holds 31.74 pct of Pioneer's 99.80 mln issued
shares, it said in a statement.
    The offer price values the entire Pioneer Sugar share
capital at 219.6 mln dlrs and compares with today's closing
market level of 1.85 dlrs a share.
    CSR said it will announce further details of the offer
soon, including an alternative offer of CSR shares for Pioneer
Sugar stock.
    It said the offer is generous since it will give Pioneer
Sugar shareholders a price equivalent to 29 times Pioneer's net
earnings last financial year and a premium of 22 pct over
yesterday's market price which CSR said it believed already
contained an element of takeover speculation.
    It also gives a premium of 91 pct over Pioneer's last
reported net tangible assets per share, CSR said.
    CSR said the generous offer price reflects the cost savings
which will flow from integrated management of CSR's and
Pioneer's raw sugar mills and building materials businesses.
    These economies can only be achieved through CSR control
and management of Pioneer Sugar, it added.
    The takeover announcement came soon after CSR's earlier
reported statement that it will sell its <Delhi Petroleum Pty
Ltd> unit to an Exxon Corp <XON> unit for 985 mln dlrs and not
proceed with the previously announced float of part of Delhi.

disappointed by Gencorp's response to its tender offer and
asked how the company might give better value to shareholders.
    Gencorp had earlier urged shareholders to reject a 100 dlr

studying financially superior alternatives.
    The General Acquisition partnership called the response

    The partnership said Gencorp failed to say how it would
provide a "superior value yet they continue their attempt to
prevent a satisfactory offer by failing to redeem their poison

takeovers more expensive.

project which could result in a public share offer of up to 49
pct of its French unit <European Sugar (France)> and could
raise around 400 mln dlrs, Ferruzzi chairman Raul Gardini said.
    Gardini told Reuters the operation under consideration was
aimed at "international markets" and that the figure of 400 mln
dlrs given in some press reports "was probably about right."
    European Sugar, wholly-owned by Ferruzzi unit Eridania
Zuccherifici Nazionali SpA <ERDI.M>, is expected to absorb the
European corn wet milling business of CPC International Inc
<CPC.N> which Ferruzzi recently agreed to buy.
    Ferruzzi announced last week it had agreed in principle to
buy the CPC operation for 630 mln dlrs.
    A Ferruzzi spokesman later confirmed that the group was
studying the transfer of the CPC business to European Sugar
along with a possible share offering in the Paris unit, but
gave no details.
    The flotation plan has been interpreted by financial
analysts as a means of helping finance the acquisition of the
CPC business.
    In London yesterday, chairman of Belgian starch producer
<Amylum NV> Pierre Callebaut told Reuters that since Ferruzzi
was "apparently still organising finance," his company might
still succeed with its rival bid for the CPC business.
    Gardini, commenting on Callebaut's remarks, said the 630
mln dlrs agreed for the CPC acquisition would be paid "at the
date foreseen in the preliminary contract."
    Gardini could not reveal the date in question nor give any
indication of the likely timing of an offering of shares in
European Sugar, but it was announced last week that Ferruzzi's
purchase of the CPC business was expected to be completed by
September 30.
    Callebaut said yesterday that Amylum was surprised and
disappointed that its 675 mln dlr bid cash offer for CPC's
European business was apparently rejected in favour of
Ferruzzi's lower bid.
    Gardini, commenting on Callebaut's remarks, said "Amylum
should know that one succeeds in a bid by making the right
offer at the right moment - exactly as Ferruzzi did in the case
of the acquisition of CPC's European business."
    Gardini said it was not Callebaut's business to concern
himself with the European Sugar capital raising operation under
study, he added.
    Asked about press reports that Ferruzzi might follow up the
European Sugar flotation with the sale of 49 pct of the CPC
business, Gardini said: "We do not exclude having minority

    Following a meeting yesterday with Borg-Warner officials

letter to the Borg-Warner board outling the terms of the
proposal that would be made by tender offer, pursuant to a
mutually acceptable merger agreement to be approved by the
Borg-Warner board and conditioned on that board's

    GAF, in its letter, stated it intends to finance the
proposed acquisition entirely with its own funds and bank
borrowings under a syndicated bank loan from a group of banks
led by Chase Manhattan Corp's <CMB> Chase Manhattan Bank.
    Last week, GAF increased its ownership of Borg-Warner

    GAF emphasized "the amicable nature of the proposed

    Based on a maximum of about 2.75 Keycorp shares and a

dropped or dismissed. The Federal Communications Commission has
already approved the station's sale.
    Money from the sale of the station will play a role in
helping develop an alternative to the tender offer co-sponsored
by AFG Industries Inc <AFG> and Wagner and Brown, Reynolds
said. He provided no other details.
    Randall Hubbard, chairman of AFG, and Joel Reed, chief
financial officer of Wagner and Brown, attended the meeting,
which was shifted from a tire plant to a downtown hotel. About
300 people were present despite an overnight snowstorm.
    Hubbard and Reed chatted briefly with Reynolds after the
meeting but declined to discuss their proposal with reporters.
    Reynolds told the shareholders friends and family members
have been telling him "Bill, just don't pay greenmail" to end
the takeover threat. Greenmail describes a buyout of a minority
shareholder at a price not available to other holders. Reynolds
said he considers it a "repugnant device."
    Shareholders elected management's slate of 11 directors.
Mario Gabelli, head of a New York investment firm which owns a
large block of stock, proposed one nominee for the board.
Gabelli said the unsuccessful attempt was designed to "stiffen
the backbone of the board to discourage greenmail."
    Hubbard and Reed reiterated previous statements that they
are open to negotiations with GenCorp.
    Asked about severance contracts for key executives in the
event of a shift in control of the company, Reynolds asserted
"we're developing alternatives that would not result in a
change in control."
    Asked whether the company's plan would be superior to any
proposal of AFG and Wagner and Brown, Reynolds commented, "We
know the company, we know the values and we know the
opportunities better than any outside group."
    In response to a question about whether any units are up
for sale, he said only that GenCorp is evaluating alternatives.

resist GAF Corp's 46-dlr-per-share takeover offer, but the
Midwest conglomerate may fall prey to another offer,
either from GAF or its own management, analysts believe.
    Analysts also said Borg-Warner may attempt to escape GAF
through a restructuring. The speculation pushed Borg-Warner's
stock up 1-3/8 to 48-1/2 in heavy trading.
    Analysts predicted feisty GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman will
stage a tough campaign to gain control of Borg-Warner so he can
add its profitable plastics and chemical business to GAF.
    "It seems from at least their dealing with (raider Irwin)
Jacobs that they don't want to be taken over. The question is
now do they acquiesce to GAF. I think instinctively, they want
to remain independent," said Dudley Heer of Duff and Phelps.
    Borg-Warner has been under siege by takeover speculation
for almost a year. Last week, Jacobs' investment vehicle,
Minstar Inc, and an investor group sold its 10.1 mln
Borg-Warner shares. The same day, GAF Corp raised its stake by
9.1 mln shares to 19.9 pct of the outstanding.
    Jacobs was interested in buying the company, but took no
steps toward a transaction.
    "Their (Borg-Warner) policy has been to stonewall them for
the last nine months. It's been one of the dullest corporate
battles I've seen," said one analyst.
    The battle, however, has heated up, and the range of
breakup values on Wall Street span from the current market
price to almost 60 dlrs per share. Most analysts said they
think a price in the low 50s would be appropriate.
    Arbitragers speculate that GAF will not give up easily on
its 3.16 billion dlr offer to buy the balance of Borg-Warner.
    Analysts who know GAF predict Heyman will either end up
with Borg-Warner or enrich his chemicals and building materials
company in some other way. Heyman two years ago attempted an
unsuccessful takeover of Union Carbide Corp, but GAF benefited
from that company's restructuring.
    "Borg Warner can't quibble that it's not a legitimate
offer. It seems to me the short of it is Borg Warner is kind of
between a rock and a hard place. They either have to accept a
46 dlr proposal or perhaps work a deal where it's sweetened. I
personally think the company is (worth) around 55 dlrs per
share," said Pershing analyst Richard Henderson.
    Henderson also speculated the company might attempt a
restructuring such as the one carried out by Goodyear Tire and
Rubber Co last year when it was being courted by Sir James
Goldsmith. The company bought back the financier's stock and
carried out a wider share repurchase.
    Arbitragers, however, said they do not believe Heyman is
seeking "greenmail," or the repurchase of his stock by the
company at a premium.
    Analysts noted that Heyman seems to have no problems with
financing the transaction.
    Previously associated with "junk bond" experts, Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc, GAf said it would finance its Borg-Warner
takeover with bank financing. GAF said it would make a tender
offer following a merger agreement approved by the Borg-WArner
board and conditioned on the board's recommendation of the
tender offer and merger.
    Heyman said in a letter to Borg-Warner that he expects a
merger would provide job security for Borg-Warner employees
since the two companies businesses overlap. Analysts, however,
believe Heyman would sell off assets he did not want to repay
debt from the transaction.
    GAF's stock rose 1-5/8 today, to 48-5/8.
   "I believe, obviously, if GAF takes over Borg-Warner at the
level it is proposing it would enhance GAF share values
substantially," said Oppenheimer analyst Charles Rose.
    He said at 46 dlrs per share, Heyman's average cost for the
company's stock would be 44 dlrs per share based on GAF's
current holdings.
    Rose said the Borg-Warner plastics and chemical business,
which makes thermo-plastics is the asset attracting Heyman.
Analysts said it accounts for a third of Borg's earnings.
    The plastics are used in telephone equipment, office
equipment and appliances. "Borg has half the market in the U.S.
and is the leading technical player and the leading innovator,"
Rose said. Its competitors are Dow Chemical Co <DOW> and
Monsanto Corp <MTC>, he said.
    Borg-Warner also has an automotive parts business, and a
protective systems business, which includes Wells Fargo
security guards. It also has an information services business,
and is trying to sell its financial services business.
    Borg-Warner earned 206.1 mln dlrs or 2.35 dlrs per share on
revenues of 3.62 billion dlrs in 1986. Smaller GAF, in 1986,
earned on an operating basis 80.7 mln dlrs or 2.22 dlrs per
share on sales of 753.8 mln dlrs.
    GAF's net earnings included an after tax gain of 201.4 mln
from its participation in a Union Carbide exchange offer, a
special union carbide dividend, and the sale of its Union
Carbide shares.

Reuters he did not foresee major changes in Borg-Warner <BOR>
if GAF's 46 dlr-per-share offer to acquire Borg-Warner is
successful.
    "We have great respect for Borg-Warner mangagement," Heyman
said, following a speech at the American Institute of Chemical
Engineers annual meeting. "We don't have any particular changes
in mind."
    Earlier today, GAF announced that a 3.16-billion-dlr-offer
was presented to the board of directors of the Chicago-based
company.
    Last week, GAF had purchased additional shares of the
company for 40-1/8 dlrs, increasing its stake in Borg-Warner to
19.9 pct.
    In 1985, GAF made an unsuccessful effort to acquire Union
Carbide Corp for five billion dlrs, and has since expressed an
interest in acquiring a chemical company that would complement
its own chemical business.
    When asked whether GAF would consider selling the
non-chemical assets of Borg-Warner if its takeover offer is
accepted, Heyman declined to comment.
    He also refused to say whether GAF would consider
increasing its the dollar value of its takeover offer if the
initial proposal is rejected.
    Heyman emphasized that he considered the GAF offer to
Borg-Warner to be a friendly one.
    "We think we made a fair offer that is good for Borg-Warner
management and good for its shareholders," Heyman said.
     In his speech, Heyman said he feared too many chemical
companies were attempting to specialize in the same high margin
niche products.
    He said they were turning their backs on core commodity
chemical businesses. 
    Heyman said the chemical industry has taken a total of
seven billion dlrs in pre-tax writeoffs during the past two
years to trim balance sheets.
    He predicted that the U.S. chemical industry, which
reported a total of 13 billion dlrs in 1986 profits, would see
a 20 pct gain in earnings this year because of increasing
exports, cheaper feedstock costs and the weakened U.S. dlr.

plans to begin tomorrow a 40 dlr a share tender offer for 83
pct of the outstanding common stock of Purolator Courier Corp.
    The company said the tender offer is the first step in a
plan to buy 100 pct of the Purolator shares.
    Following the tender offer, Emery said it would offer 40
dlrs of junior subordinated debentures for each remaining
Purolator share outstanding.
    On March one, Purolator agreed to a 35 dlr a share
leveraged buyout by eight Purolator executives and EF Hutton
LBO Inc, a unit of EF Hutton Group Inc.
    Emery said it had tried unsuccessfully to open merger
discussions with Purolator before the company accepted the
management-led buyout offer.
    In a letter to Purolator's chairman, Nicholas F. Brady,
Emery's chairman, John C. Emery, said the company would still
prefer to negotiate with Purolator.
    But he said the imminent expiration of the leveraged buyout
group's offer has forced the company to make an unsolicited
tender offer of its own.
    Emery said its offer is scheduled to expire at 2400 EST on
April 28, unless extended.
    The company said conditions of the offer include the
receipt of at least two-thirds of Purolator's shares
outstanding, on a fully diluted basis, and the repeal of its
share purchase rights plan.
    Emery said the offer is also subject to completion of the
previously announced sale of Purolator's Canadian operations.
    Emery said Chemical Bank, Bankers Trust, Morgan Guaranty
Trust Co and Salomon Bros had agreed to provide financing for
the tender offer.
    It said the junior subordinated debentures to be issued in
the subsequent merger will carry a 13 pct annual interest rate,
payable twice a year.
    For the first three years after the notes are issued,
interest will be paid, at Emery's option, in cash or in
additional notes, Emery said.
    It added that the notes will not be subject to redemption
for one year after they are issued.
    Emery said Purolator would operate as a wholly owned unit
of the company after the merger. It said it hoped Purolator's
management would continue with the company.
    "We believe that our two companies provide an excellent fit
with each other and that the combination will enable each of us
to better serve our existing customers and meet the challenges
of the future," Emery's chairman said in his letter.
    He said a merger would significantly enhance the financial
turnaround that Purolator's management had previously forecast.
    Officials at Purolator could not immediately be reached for
comment on the offer, which was released several hours after
the stock market had closed.
    Emery's stock closed up 1/2 at 12-5/8.
    Purolator closed at 34-7/8, off 5/8.

O'Connor early this morning lifted an Appeals Court injunction
blocking the planned merger of Delta <DAL> Airlines
Inc and Western Airlines <WAL>, the Court said.
    O'Connor's action came hours after a three-judge panel of
the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco had
blocked the merger until a dispute over union representation
had been settled by arbitration.
    A Supreme Court spokesman said O'Connor granted a stay of
the injuction, allowing the merger, worth nearly 860 mln dlrs,
to go through as planned later today.
    The Supreme Court spokesman provided no other details. Each
of the nine Supreme Court justices has jurisdiction over a
particular regional Appellate circuit and has the power to
provisionally overturn its rulings without comment.
    The Appeals Court ruling surprised officials of
Atlanta-based Delta, which had been preparing for the merger
for months and had already painted Delta logos on airplanes
belonging to Western, which has headquartera in Los Angeles.
    "Our plans were to finalize the merger at midnight tonight,"
Delta spokesman Bill Berry told the Atlanta Constitution late
last night. "There was really very little that remained to be
done."
    The ruling in San Francisco came in a lawsuit that had been
filed in a Los Angeles federal court in which the Air Transport
Employees union sought to force Western's management to fulfill
a promise that it would honor union contracts if a merger took
place.
    The airlines argued that Western's promise could not be
enforced in a takeover by a larger company.
    After learning of the appeals court ruling, Delta officials
last night spread the word by telephone that Western employees
should report for work today in their old uniforms, not in new
Delta outfits.
    Delta announced last September that it was purchasing
Western. The merger took place in December, and Western has
been operated as a Delta subsidiary since then. The Western
name was to have disappeared at midnight last night.
    At issue is whether the Western unions would continue to
represent Western employees after the integration of the two
airlines.
    While all but eight pct of Western's 11,000 employees are
unionized, only Delta's pilots are union members.
    Delta had maintained that the three unions having contracts
with Western -- The Association of Flight Attendants and the
Teamsters, as well as the Air Transport Employees -- would be
"extinguished" after today.

Tire Corp Ltd> controlling shareholders Alfred, David and
Martha Billes did not extend an agreement expiring yesterday to
tender their shares only to CTC's previously reported offer for
49 pct of Canadian Tire common shares.
    CTC, which already holds 17.4 pct of Canadian Tire common,
said it would therefore not take up any shares tendered under
its offer unless they totaled at least 1.1 mln or another 32.7
pct of Canadian Tire common. The Billes control 60 pct of
Canadian Tire common. It added that it extended its offer to
May 11 at a fixed price of 165.36 dlrs a share.
    CTC, a group of Canadian Tire dealers, said it expected to
know by May 11 if it would obtain approval to appeal a
previously reported Ontario court ruling upholding a regulatory
decision to block CTC's offer.
    The dealers' bid was previously blocked by the Ontario
Securities Commission because the offer excluded holders of
Canadian Tire class A non-voting shares, which make up about 96
pct of company equity.

rejected a 25 dlr a share tender offer from Mark IV Industries
Inc <IV>, said it is exploring alternatives such as a
restructuring, leveraged buyout or takeover of the company.
     In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Conrac said its board of directors authorized its financial and
legal advisors to explore a several alternatives to the Mark IV
offer, which it said it considers inadequate.
    The alternatives being explored include a restructuring,
leveraged buyout or a takeover of the company by another
company, Conrac said.
    Conrac, which said its board discussed the alternatives at
special meetings on March 26 and 30, said that its decision on
whether to adopt any of the alternatives would hinge on "the
future actions of Mark IV" and its unsolicitied tender offer.
    Putting into effect any of the alternatives being explored
could hurt or defeat the Mark IV offer, it said.
    Board members were also instructed to keep confidential the
terms of any transaction that might be entered into until it
becomes final, the company said.
    The board also took other defensive steps, including
granting severance agreements to some officers, it said.
    At a board meeting yesterday, Concac's directors deleted a
provision allowing the holder of at least one-third of of all
classes of its voting stock to call a special shareholders
meeting and deleted another provision allowing shareholders to
remove directors without cause, the company said.
    The defensive moves were taken because Mark IV had said it
planned to elect a majority of its designees as directors at a
special holders meeting if it succeeded in acquring a majority
of the company's common stock in the offer, Conrac said.
    Conrac's president, vice president and treasurer were given
severance agreements, or "golden parachutes," it said.
    Under the agreements, Conrac President Paul Graf would get
a cash payment of twice his annual salary, which was 209,906
dlrs last year, if there were a change of control in the
company, including acquisition of 30 pct or more of the
company's voting stock, Conrac said.
    Treasurer Joseph Smorada and Vice President Joseph
O'Donnell, who made 143,325 dlrs last year, would get
one-and-a-half times his salary if there were a change in
control. Smorada's salary was not listed in the SEC filing.
    The executives would also get cash settlements of options
plans and continuation of insurance and other benefits.

unit said it extended the expiration date for its 35 dlr per
share tender offer for Purolator Courier corp to midnight EST
April six from midnight April one.
    E.F. Hutton lbo inc said its wholly owned PC Acquisition
Inc subsidiary, which is the entity making the offer, extended
both expiration date and the withdrawal rights period for its
pending tender for 6.3 mln shares or 83 pct of Purolator
common.
    Hutton's offer was topped today by a 40 dlr per share bid
for 83 pct of the stock from Emery Air Frieght Corp <EAF.>
    Both offers would pay shareholders a package of securities
for the balance of their shares, valued at the respective
tender offer prices.
    Hutton said as of the end of the day yesterday, about
880,000 shares of Purolator common stock repesenting 11.5 pct
of outstanding shares had been validly tendered and not
withdrawn.
    Manhattan supreme court justice Lewis Grossman today
adjourned until Monday a hearing on a stockholder suit seeking
to block the Hutton LBO transaction. The judge told attorneys
he needed time to hear other cases.
    Plaintiffs cited their belief that a superior offer would
be forthcoming, however one company mentioned in an affadavit,
Interlink Express plc, denied that it was interested.
    Yesterday, Frank Hoenemeyer, a retired vice chairman of
Prudential Insurance Co and currently a Purolator board member,
said an initial offer from Hutton was rejected by the board of
directors February third.
    Hoenemeyer testified that by the next meeting of the board,
February 17, Hutton submitted a revised proposal which was
accepted.
    He also testified a committee of directors had hired

offer and also to consider a discussion of possible mergers

leveraged buyout offer for Purolator Courier Corp by about 40
mln dlrs, but Wall Street is reacting as though another offer
may surface.
    Purolator's stock climbed 5-3/8 today, to 40-1/8, 1/4 over
Emery's 40 dlr per share offer. Emery topped a 35 dlr per share
or 268 mln dlr offer from E.F. Hutton LBO Inc.
    Some analysts said the latest, 306 mln dlr offer for
Purolator exceeded their expectations.
    Several analysts previously had said they saw takeover
values for the package delivery company in the 35 dlr per share
range. At least one, however, estimated the company could be
taken over in a range of 38 to 42 dlrs per share.
    Analysts today would not venture to say whether another
offer could be made, but some arbitragers still held to the
belief that the bidding could go higher.
    "They have no choice to seek out the best possible offer.
Emery has shown the courage to go forth," said one arbitrager,
who speculated other courier companies may also emerge as
bidders.
    "It makes sense," said James Parker of Robinson Humphrey.
But "It won't make out as well as they think. They won't get a
100 pct of the synergies."
    Analysts said the acquisition could cost Emery earnings in
the short term, but long term, after eliminating redundancies
and selling other Purolator assets, it should boost Emery's
profitability.
    Parker said a combined Purolator and Emery would rival
United Parcel Service as the second largest U.S. package
delivery company after Federal Express Corp <FDX>, which has 47
pct of the market.
    Parker speculated that the combined Emery-Purolator would
have about 24 pct of the six to seven billion dlr delivery
business.
    "This will make Emery a bigger factor in the light weight
(delivery) business, but it will not make them a power house,"
said Douglas Arthur of Kidder, Peabody and Co.
    Purolator today declined comment on the Emery offer, and
its chairman Nicholas Brady did not return a phone call.
    E.F.Hutton LBO also declined comment on the Emery offer,
but said it extended the expiration and withdrawal period on
its offer to April six at midnight from today at midnight EST.
    One analyst speculated the extension makes it more likely
Hutton will attempt another offer. However, he was skeptical a
company outside the package delivery industry would want to
outbid 40 dlrs per share because it would not have the same 
synergies as a courier company.
    Since Purolator agreed in late February to a buyout by some
of its management and the E.F. Hutton Group <EFH> subsidiary,
speculation has arisen that more bidding was to come.
    The buyout was surrounded by controversy since a Purolator
board member, Doresy Gardner resigned in March. Gardner said he
believed a better offer could be made by another entity.
    A spokesman for Gardner today said the former director had
no contact with Emery, nor did he have any other buyers lined
up for Purolator.
    Purolator's deal with Hutton was also called into question
by a shareholder suit filed earlier this week, which attempted
to stop the tender offer to allow another bidder to come forth.
Hearings in a New York state court were delayed until Monday.
    Arbitragers had said they believed the Hutton offer could
be bettered because the Wall Street firm was not planning to
keep its cash tied up in Purolator. Hutton is providing a 279
mln dlr "bridge" loan that would later be replaced with other
debt. Hutton would maintain a majority interest in Purolator.
    Hutton sources have said the firm was in fact facing risk n
its investment since it did not know when it could reclaim its
279 mln dlr loan.
    Emery last year lost 5.4 mln dlrs on revenues of 887.5 mln
dlrs. Purolator lost 57.6 mln dlrs on 841.4 mln dlrs in
revenues.

Edelman has acquired a stake in Polaroid Corp and optimism
about tomorrow's status hearing on the patent infringement suit
pending with Eastman Kodak Co <EK> sent Polaroid's stock
higher, traders said.
    Polaroid rose 1-1/8 to 74-1/2.
    "Speculation that Edelman was going to take a stake in
Polaroid was kicking around a few months ago, and resurfaced
today," one trader said.
    Edelman had no comment on the rumors.
    A spokesman for Polaroid said the company had not been
contacted by Edelman and no filing had been made with the
Securities and Exchange Commission about a stake in the
company.
    "There is some hope among investors that there will some
progress in the status hearing tomorrow on the patent
infringement suit with Kodak," analyst Michael Ellmann of
Wertheim and Co said.
    Traders said it is conceivable that a trial date could be
set or some progress made on an out-of-court settlement.
    The suit, filed by Polaroid in April 1976, charges that
Kodak infringed upon Polaroid's instant camera patent. In
October 1985, the court barred Kodak from selling cameras or
film that infringe upon the patent, the Polaroid spokesman
said.
    Ellmann said he feels it is highly unlikely that any
progress will be made in tomorrow's hearing.
    Ellmann said the stock may have also gotten a boost today
from some optimism concerning new products the company is
currently working on.
    "Polaroid's announcement that a particularly senior company
executive had been chosen to work on a major unidentified new
product spurred some speculation about their products," he
said. "I am speculating that the new product could be an
electronic still camera," referring to a camera that records
its images on magnetic disks as opposed to conventional film.

to take over the outstanding 25 pct in <Deutsche Bank (Asia)
AG>, the former <European Asian Bank AG>, from
Creditanstalt-Bankverein <CABV.VI>, Deutsche management board
joint spokesman Alfred Herrhausen told a news conference.
    Euras broke even in 1986 and required no funding from
Deutsche, he said. He gave no details of the deal with
Creditanstalt.
    Press reports that Deutsche was planning a takeover of
Lloyds Bank plc <LLOY.L> were without foundation, he said.
    Herrhausen said Deutsche had taken part in the recent
capital increase of <Morgan Grenfell Group plc>, but had no
plans to raise its 4.4 pct share in Morgan Grenfell.
    <Banca d'America e d'Italia SpA>, in which 98.3 pct was
acquired from Bankamerica Corp <BAC.N> late last year, would be
consolidated this year, and contribute to further expansion of
Deutsche's business, management board joint spokesman F.
Wilhelm Christians said.
    Following a ruling earlier this year from the Federal High
Court, Deutsche had included its non-bank holdings in the
balance sheet section "participations," Christians said.
    But Christians said the bank still regarded shares in these
non-bank companies as an investment rather than an active
participation.
    Parent bank total participations rose to 6.45 billion marks
in 1986 from a comparable 4.57 billion in 1985 including a rise
to 3.79 billion from 2.34 billion in bank participations.
    Herrhausen said the grouping of holdings in the balance
sheet in this was was not a first step to floating them off in
a separate holding company.

a new telecommunications firm in which Britain's Cable and
Wireless Plc would be a core company.
    However, the plan, unveiled by senior Federation of
Economic Organizations official Fumio Watanabe, does not
specify what stake Cable and Wireless would have.
    "The share holdings of the core companies should be equal,"
Watanabe said in a statement. "The actual percentage of
shareholdings should be agreed by the core companies."
    He said the eight core companies will provide directors for
the firm.
    "The new company shall immediately set to work on the
feasibility study of constructing a new cable for itself,"
Watanabe said.
    Watanabe has acted as mediator between two rival groups,
one of which included C and W, seeking to compete against
<Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd>, which now monopolizes Japan's
overseas telephone business.
    The Post and Telecommunications Ministry has said it wants
only one competitor to KDD and has backed Watanabe's efforts.
    A British source, who declined to be identified further,
said the proposals could open the door to further talks between
C and W <CAWL.L> and the other firms involved.
    C and W had earlier rejected a reported proposal which
would have given it a five pct share in the new
telecommunications firm, compared to the less than three pct
stake Watanabe originally proposed. C and W has a 20 pct stake
in one of the two firms Watanabe has proposed should merge.
    The British source said the decision not to specify the
exact shareholdings of the core companies could leave the door
open for further discussion.
    "It's probably a sensible approach on their part," the
British source told reuters.
    C and W has also been pushing hard for permission to lay a
new cable between Japan and the U.S.
    The proposed merger has sparked an international row, with
British government sources threatening retaliatory action
against Japan for what they see as discriminatory practices
against foreign firms.
    The sources said last Friday that one option for Britain
would be to revoke licenses of Japanese banks and securities
companies operating in London.
    The U.S. Has also attacked the original merger plans,
saying that both rival consortia should be licensed.
    Asked about participation by other U.S. And European firms,
Watanabe said, "They will not be core companies but if they wish
they could participate." Under the Japanese law, total foreign
participation would be limited to one-third.
    "It might be wise for C and W to join the new firm which has
the support of many influential backers and work within this
for the realization of their ideas," Watanabe told reporters.
    The other core firms are Mitsubishi Corp <MITT.T>, Mitsui
and Co <MITS.T>, Sumitomo Corp <SUMT.T>, Matsushita Electric
Industrial Co <MC.T>, Toyota Motor Corp <TOYO.T>, C Itoh and Co
<CITT.T>, and <Pacific Telesis International Inc>.
    Watanabe said that his latest proposal represented his
final effort.
    If it fails to satisfy the British government, it will be
up to the Japanese government to explain its position, he said.

Coconut Planters Bank>, UCPB, have reached a compromise on a
disputed block of 38.1 mln shares of SMC, the head of a
government panel that controls the sequestered shares said.
    Ramon Diaz, Chairman of the Presidential Commission on Good
Government (PCGG) told Reuters SMC had offered a price of 126
pesos per share for the block, held in trust by the UCPB.
    "It looks good," Diaz said. But he added several issues,
including the identity of the ultimate buyers of the shares,
had to be resolved before the PCGG gave its approval to the
sale.
    The PCGG's sequestration last year of 33 mln shares aborted
SMC's bid to buy them back from 14 trading companies in the
UCPB group. The commission said it suspected the shares were
actually controlled by Eduardo Cojuangco, an associate of
former President Ferdinand Marcos.
    Cojuango, who headed the boards of both SMC and UCPB when
he fled last year after Marcos was toppled, personally owned 24
mln shares in SMC. His holdings are also under sequestration.
    "The shares that SMC now proposes to buy from the UCPB are
owned by 1.4 mln coconut farmers," Diaz said. "Naturally we do
not want them to go back into the hands of Marcos cronies."
    PCGG sources said a compromise would end a row over a down
payment of 500 mln pesos made by SMC's Hong Kong subsidiary
Neptunia Corp Ltd in a bid to buy back the shares last year.
    The UCPB had said the 500 mln peso payment would be
forfeited because SMC Chairman Andres Soriano III had failed to
fulfil his commitment to buy back the shares at an originally
negotiated price of 3.3 billion pesos.
    PCGG sources said SMC, the Philippines' largest food and
beverage manufacturer, has agreed to sell 14 mln "B" class shares
from the 38.1 mln shares to Australian brewer Alan Bond at a
price of 150 pesos per share.
    The PCGG sources said of the proposed 4.79 billion peso
transaction, 1.6 billion pesos would be offset against the 500
mln peso down payment, the 500 mln pesos worth of preferred
shares in UCPB held by SMC, 210 mln pesos in uncollected
dividends on the UCPB shares and 400 mln pesos advanced to
UCPB-controlled trading companies.
    The UCPB rejected an original offer of 100 pesos per share
made by SMC for 33 mln shares, which grew to 38 mln after a 15
pct stock dividend declared in June last year.
    A spokesman for SMC said the company's 15-member board met
today to discuss the proposed compromise.
    The spokesman declined comment on the outcome of the board
meeting, saying the dispute was under arbitration.
    President Corazon Aquino last month asked SMC and UCPB to
set up a three-man arbitration panel to resolve the ownership
issue. The panel is due to submit its report by April 15.
    Eduardo de Los Angeles, a government nominee in the SMC
board, filed a formal complaint before the Securities and
Exchange Commission last week, accusing Soriano and eight other
directors of violating "fiduciary duty."
    De Los Angeles was said to have opposed a decision by SMC's
board last December to assume the 500 mln peso Neptunia loan.

it was making an increased and final offer for the Avana Group
Plc <AVNA.L>. The company already holds about 22.9 pct or 7.1

    It said in a statement the terms of the offer will be 13
new Rank Hovis shares for every five Avana ordinary shares,
valuing each Avana share at 829p.
    Avana shareholders will be entitled to receive and retain
the net interim dividend of 5.25p per Avana share for the year
ending 28 March 1987.
    Accepting Avana shareholders will also be entitled to
receive Ranks Hovis's forecast net interim dividend of 2.65p
for the financial year ending 5 September 1987.
    Ranks Hovis said that full acceptance of the increased
offer would result in the issue of a maximum of 72.3 mln new
Ranks Hovis shares or about 20 pct of the enlarged issued
ordinary share capital of the company.
    The latest offer will lapse on 17 April. Ordinary
shareholders in Avana who accept the increased offer will have
the opportunity to elect for cash for all or part of their
holdings on the basis of 800p cash for each Avana share.
    Ranks Hovis said the cash required for the cash alternative
would be met by one of several methods.
    For the first 10 mln Avana shares received opting for the
cash alternative, Ranks Hovis would make a cash payment from
its own resources.
    For cash alternatives of more than 10 mln Avana shares,
Morgan Grenfell, as agent for participants, will make a
separate offer to purchase at 300p per share, net of expenses,
up to 46.3 mln Ranks Hovis new shares to which such
shareholders will be entitled under the increased offer. This
is equivalent to 780p per Avana ordinary.
    In addition, Ranks Hovis will make a further cash payment

made earlier this week and reported in the Japanese press.
    Cable has a 20 pct stake in one of the two groups trying to

monopolises Japan's overseas telephone business.
    But a Cable spokesman said it still believed a merger of

    The Japanese authorities want only one competitor and have
proposed that the two consortia band together. The issue has
been taken up by the British government as a test case on the

that the eight core companies of the new group should have
equal share holdings but added that they could work out the
precise percentages amongst themselves.

more difficulty combining its two railroads than fending off a
possible takeover by Henley Group <HENG>, which has accumulated
almost a five pct stake in the real estate and railroad
conglomerate, analysts said.
    Takeover speculation has surrounded Santa Fe since Henley
disclosed its stake in the company earlier this week, but
analysts and a Santa Fe official were skeptical a takeover is
its intention.
    Analysts also said the company has strong defenses that
would easily deter any suitor - one of those being its problems
combining its two railroad properties, which hang in regulatory
limbo.
    Richard Fischer of Merrill Lynch and Co Inc said that Santa
Fe at December 31 had 580 mln dlrs in cash and cash
equivalents, while its long-term debt to capital was just over
25 pct. "This gives them plenty of borrowing power," he said,
which could be used against an unwanted suitor.
    Henley Group's Chairman Michael Dingman has said he wants
to take major positions in undervalued natural resource
companies. He also told Reuters in an interview he is seeking
an acquisition of from two billion to eight billion dlrs.
    Santa Fe officials don't appear concerned that Henley might
launch a takeover. "I would not characterize the atmosphere
around here as one of concern," one Santa Fe executive said
about Henley.
    "I think it's wrong to assume Dingman has formed a firm
strategy with Santa Fe," said Mark Hassenberg, who covers
Henley for DLJ Securities.
    Analysts say the potential of Santa Fe's land assets are
likely to be realized slowly. They add that Santa Fe's efforts
to merge its two railroads remain in regulatory limbo,
sidetracking many of its strategic plans for the foreseeable
future.
    These realities, they said, support the Henley Group's
statement that its Santa Fe stake is only an investment.
    The more pressing problem facing Santa Fe is overcoming
difficulties in merging its two railroads, the Atchison, Topeka
and Santa Fe Railway Co and Southern Pacific Transportation Co.
The merger would create the nation's second-longest railroad.
    Last July the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) denied
the merger on anticompetitive grounds.
    The company since has granted trackage-sharing rights to
four western railroads to meet the ICC's concerns and persuade
it to reopen the hearings in its three-year-old struggle to
merge the lines.
    "My guess is the commission will decide in three to six
weeks whether to reopen hearings," Fischer said.
    "I believe they've made an effort to satisfy the ICC's
objections," he said. "But in doing so they haven't pleased
everyone. Before they had Burlington Northern on their side,
now Burlington is opposed to the way trackage rights are set
up."
    If the hearings are reopened, analysts predicted it will
take six to nine months for everyone to have their say, and up
to another year for the ICC to decide.
    Santa Fe is in the midst of a 50-mln-share stock buyback
program begun in 1984. It has bought back 33.7 mln shares as of
February 1, when it had 154.7 mln shares outstanding, a
spokesman said.
    Among the shares repurchased were two stakes owned by
Norfolk Southern, one of 3.4 mln shares bought in 1986 and
another of 1.7 mln shares in 1985, one analyst said.
    James Voytko at Paine Webber believes Santa Fe could fight
off the Henley Group with its cash and credit. Citing the share
buybacks from Norfolk Southern, he said one of Santa Fe's
options, if threatened, could be to buy the Henley stake.
    "It is indeed possible that Dingman sees this as a
low-risk, opportunistic investment," Voytko said.
    "People who follow Santa Fe have given me values of 45 dlrs
to 50 dlrs a share," said DLJ Securities' Hassenberg. "But I'm
certain that in Dingman's mind, the company is worth more than
that in breakup value."

Commission reminded corporate raiders and others tendering for
the shares of companies that they must extend the period their
offers are open if key conditions are changed.
    Specifically, the agency said those making tender offers
for companies' stock must extend the offers if they decide to
eliminate conditions requiring a minimum number of shares to be
tendered in order for the offers to be valid.
    Tender offers typically include minimum share conditions.
As a result, a purchaser would not be bound to buy the shares
that were tendered if the minimum level were not reached.
    In an interpretation of current rules, which officials said
clarifies the SEC's present position, the agency said a tender
offer must be extended if a minimum share condition is waived,
even if the purchaser reserved the right to do so.
    The interpretation makes clear that waiving a minimum share
condition is a "material change" of the tender offer under U.S.
securities law, SEC officials said.
    The SEC has already said that other specific material
changes, such as changes in the percentage of securities being
sought or the price being offered, made during the course of a
tender offer require a 10-day extension of the offer.
    The length of the extension, which is aimed at giving
shareholders an adequate chance to assess revisions of a tender
offer, was not specified in cases where the minimum share
conditions were waived.
    SEC officials said the length of the extension in such
cases would depend on the facts and circumstances surrounding
each case, but would generally be between five and 10 days.
    The agency cited two recent tender offers in which waivers
of a minimum share conditios were tried on the last day of each
offer, denying shareholders the chance to react to the new
information. Officials declined to identify the two offers.
    "If a bidder makes a material change near or at the end of
its offer, it will have to extend the offer to permit adequate
dissemination," the SEC said.
    Federal securities law requires that all tender offers
remain open for at least 20 business days.

oil and gas producer <TMOC Resources Ltd> in a counter-bid to
the previously reported takeover offer by Santos Ltd <STOS.S>.
    The offer values TMOC shares at 4.75 dlrs each, based on
AGL's closing price of 8.50 dlrs on Friday. TMOC shares jumped
to 4.60 dlrs on the announcement from its Friday closing price
of 4.15.
    The AGL offer, the third to be made for TMOC this year,
compares with the Santos cash offer of 4.00 dlrs a share.
    Based on TMOC's issued capital of 62.08 mln shares, the AGL
offer values the entire company at 249.9 mln shares.
    AGL said in a statement that it already holds 10.5 pct of
TMOC's issued capital. This compares with the Santos stake of
3.1 pct when it announced its bid in March 23.
    <Elders Resources Ltd> began the auction for TMOC about

on-market offer that has since lapsed.
    AGL said its offer is above the upper end of the range of

lose its status as Japan's most profitable bank as a result of
its merger with the Heiwa Sogo Bank, financial analysts said.
    Osaka-based Sumitomo, with desposits of around 23.9
trillion yen, merged with Heiwa Sogo, a small, struggling bank
with an estimated 1.29 billion dlrs in unrecoverable loans, in
October.
    But despite the link-up, Sumitomo President Koh Komatsu
told Reuters he is confident his bank can quickly regain its
position.
    "We'll be back in position in first place within three
years," Komatsu said in an interview.
    He said that while the merger will initially reduce
Sumitomo's profitability and efficiency, it will vastly expand
Sumitomo's branch network in the Tokyo metropolitan area where
it has been relatively weak.
    But financial analysts are divided on whether and how
quickly the gamble will pay off.
    Some said Sumitomo may have paid too much for Heiwa Sogo in
view of the smaller bank's large debts. Others argue the merger
was more cost effective than creating a comparable branch
network from scratch.
    The analysts agreed the bank was aggressive. It has
expanded overseas, entered the lucrative securities business
and geared up for domestic competition, but they questioned the
wisdom of some of those moves.
    "They've made bold moves to put everything in place. Now
it's largely out of their hands," said Kleinwort Benson Ltd
financial analyst Simon Smithson.
    Among Sumitomo's problems are limits placed on its move to
enter U.S. Securities business by taking a share in American
investment bank Goldman, Sachs and Co.
    Sumitomo last August agreed to pay 500 mln dlrs for a 12.5
pct limited partnership in the bank, but for the time being at
least, the Federal Reserve Board has forbidden them to exchange
personnel, or increase the business they do with each other.
    "The tie-up is widely looked on as a lame duck because the
Fed was stricter than Sumitomo expected," said one analyst.
    But Komatsu said the move will pay off in time.
    "U.S. Regulations will change in the near future and if so,
we can do various things. We only have to wait two or three
years, not until the 21st century," Komatsu said.
    Komatsu is also willing to be patient about possible routes
into the securities business at home.
    Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Act, Japan's
version of the U.S. Glass-Steagall Act, separates commercial
from investment banking.
    But the walls between the two are crumbling and Komatsu
said he hopes further deregulation will create new
opportunities.
    "We need to find new business chances," Komatsu said. "In some
cases these will be securities related, in some cases trust
bank related. That's the kind of deregulation we want."
    Until such changes occur, Sumitomo will focus on such
domestic securities business as profitable government bond
dealing and strengthening relations with Meiko Securities Co
Ltd, in which it holds a five pct share, Komatsu said.
    He said Sumitomo is cautiously optimistic about entering
the securities business here through its Swiss universal bank
subsidiary, Banca del Gottardo.
     The Finance Ministry is expected to grant licences to
securities subsidiaries of U.S. Commercial banks soon,
following a similar decision for subsidiaries of European
universal banks in which the parent holds a less than 50 pct.
    But Komatsu is reluctant to push hard for a similar
decision on a Gottardo subsidiary.
    "We don't want to make waves. We expect this will be allowed
in two or three years," he said.
    Like other city banks, Sumitomo is also pushing to expand
lending to individuals and small and medium businesses to
replace disappearing demand from big business, he added.
    The analysts said Sumitomo will have to devote a lot of
time to digesting its most recent initiatives, including the
merger with ailing Heiwa Sogo.
    "It's (Sumitomo) been bold in its strategies," said
Kleinwort's Smithson.
    "After that, it's a question of absorbing and juggling
around. It will be the next decade before we see if the
strategy is right or wrong."

to buy back 38.1 mln sequestered shares from United Coconut
Planters Bank (UCPB) has been hit by two new lawsuits, sources
in the Philippine food and brewery company said.
    A Manila court yesterday issued an injunction barring UCPB
from selling the shares, which represent 31 pct of SMC's
outstanding capital stock of 121 mln shares, until hearings on
April 21 on a petition filed by Eduardo Cojuangco, a former
chairman of both SMC and UCPB.
    Cojuangco said the Coconut Industry Investment Fund (CIIF)
and 1.4 mln farmers were the rightful owners of the shares.
    Cojuangco said the shares were held in trust by UCPB and
represented a blue chip investment. His petition said UCPB's
plans to sell the shares to SMC were "a serious breach of
fiduciary duties."
    The SMC sources said the proposed share sale could also be
held up by a second derivative suit filed before the Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC) by Eduardo de los Angeles, a
government nominee on the company's board.
    De los Angeles, who represents SMC's minority stockholders,
asked the SEC to block the transaction, approved last week by
the company's board.
    On April 2 the board sanctioned the repurchase of the
sequestered shares for 4.79 billion pesos at 126 pesos per
share. De los Angeles told the SEC the company's retained
earnings of 1.33 billion pesos would be wiped out by the
purchase of the shares and would prevent the declaration of
dividends.
    De los Angeles said the share purchase would also violate
an SMC agreement with its creditors to maintain a 2.2-to-1 debt
to equity ratio. He quoted SMC's chief financial director Ramon
del Rosario as telling the board that the transaction would
boost the ratio to 2.5-to-1.
    In petitioning the SEC, de los Angeles amended an earlier
suit two weeks ago in which he charged SMC Chairman Andres
Soriano III and nine other directors of violating their duties.
    De los Angeles' earlier complaint related to SMC assuming
last December a 26.5 mln dlr loan contracted by SMC's Hong Kong
subsidiary <Neptunia Corp> for a down payment on the shares.
The loan assumption was again ratified by last week's board
meeting.
    An arbitration panel set up by President Corazon Aquino to
resolve the ownership issue is expected to submit its report by
April 15.
    "The amended suit filed by Eduardo de los Angeles is part of
a continuing attempt by certain elements, in complete disregard
of the facts and with questionable motives, to delay an early
disposition of the sequestered shares," San Miguel Corp said in
a statement.
    "Coming as it does, when San Miguel Corp and UCPB have
reached agreement on the price of the shares and the method of
payment, this suit is in direct contravention of the
government's expressed desire to reach an amicable settlement
of the controversy by April 15," the statement added.
    A San Miguel spokesman said he had no comment on
Cojuangco's court petition, adding: "Any statement coming from
us might be interpreted as adversarial."
    Meanwhile, Ramon Diaz, the head of a government panel which
sequestered the shares last year, said Soriano was not eligible
to buy the major portion of the shares because he was a United
States citizen.
    The sequestered shares are split into 24 mln "A" shares,
which can only be owned by Filipinos, and 14 mln "B" shares which
are available to foreign buyers.
    SMC sources said Soriano personally was not among
prospective buyers. They said the shares would be purchased by
the <A.Soriano> group of companies, SMC, Neptunia and unnamed
institutional investors. Soriano was named as one of the buyers
in a bid in March 1986 for 33 mln shares controlled by UCPB.
    The sale was aborted when Diaz's Presidential Commission on
Good Government sequestered the shares on suspicion they were
owned by Cojuangco, a close associate of former President
Ferdinand Marcos. Cojuangco lives in self-imposed exile in the
U.S.. The shares grew to 38.1 mln after a 15 pct stock dividend
announced last June.
    "We have no objection to Soriano buying the "B" shares," Diaz
told Reuters. "But everything is on hold now."
    The SMC spokesman said he did not know if the controversy
would be resolved before the company's annual stockholders'
meeting, scheduled for May 14.
    San Miguel Corp reported sales revenue of 12.2 billion
pesos in 1986, 11 pct above its 10.9 billion peso sales in
1985. It said unaudited net profit was in the neighbourhood of
700 mln pesos, an increase of about 50 pct over 1985.

William Proxmire (D-Wis) said he planned to introduce
legislation shortly to require greater public disclosure of
corporate takeovers and fairer treatment for all shareholders.
    Speaking to the National Association of Manufacturers,
Proxmire said recent insider trading stock scandals increased
the chance that Congress will act to curb abuses.
    "We are proposing legislation that would provide for more
disclosure, would be fairer to all shareholders, and would
insure that takeovers are properly financed," he said.
    Among the provisions, the bill would reduce the threshold
for notifying the Securities and Exchange Commission that a
investor or group has acquired a percentage of stock in a
company to three pct from the current five pct threshold within
10 days, Proxmire said.
    In addition, there would be a pre-notificaton requirement
that an investor intended to aquire three pct that would have
to filed with the SEC.
    Proxmire said the pre-notification requirement was meant to
prevent arbitragers from having a jump on the general public in
knowing about coming takeover attempts.
    Proxmire said he would call for extending the period that a
tender offer must be kept open under the Williams Act to 60
business days from the current 20 business days.
    His bill would provide for private suits if the acquiring
company violated the time period on the tender offer.
    To correct abuses in the financing of takeovers, Proxmire
said the legislation would aim at insuring current margin
requirments are properly enforced.
    The Federal Reserve Board has a 50 pct margin requirement
for purchasing stock, but Proxmire said it is not generally
enforced in hostile takeovers.
    Rather, the groups or individuals leading a takeover
declare that they can raise the capital for a takeover without

    "As far as I am concerned and the company is concerned, they

    "All the information that has been given out publicly is
that, yes, Dominion Textile is interested in making an

on its own business as its competitors found merger partners,
but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself
into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said.
    The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose
4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and
Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct
stake.
    A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly
acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover
offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for
Montreal-based Dominion called the report just "rumors."
    Burlington said it did not know if the report was true.
    Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of
the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if
Burlington actually came into play.
    Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however,
added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it
was looking for a takeover in the U.S.
    Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills
and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for
a U.S. acquisition.
    A Dominion spokesman said Canada's largest textile producer
has been negotiating with "many" U.S. textile companies, but
would not say whether Burlington was among them.
    "There have been acquisitions in this area. It's not
unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the
housecleaning they've done," said Eileen Gormley of Thomson
McKinnon.
    Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets
and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs
last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its
operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign
competition, Gormley said.
    "They've pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer,"
said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial
fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets
and other fabric to the auto industry.
    "In the past, they just spent and never realized the return
on the outlays they did make," she said.
    "You look at their record over the year, and I think
they're poised to be more profitable than they had been in the
past," Gormley said.
     She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up
from 2.01 dlrs per share.
    Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington
at its current levels.
    Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends
selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50
dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings
basis.
    Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been
placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share.
    "After Asher's (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people
don't find him very credible anymore," said one arbitrager.
    Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing
managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if
he doesn't win the target company.
    Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for Lucky
Stores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buying
Ponderosa Inc.
    The stocks of other textile makers rose along with
Burlington.
    J.P. Stevens <STN> climbed 5/8 to 44-7/8, and Fieldcrest
Cannon Inc <FLD>, the result of a merger of Fieldcrest and
Cannon, rose 1-1/8 to 39-3/4. West Point-Pepperell Inc <WPM>

afternoon to the pilots union proposal to buy its United
Airlines unit, a UAL spokesman said.
    "Obviously, we have a lot of movement in our stock, and we
need to get a clarification out," the spokesman said, adding
that there was a "50-50" chance a statement would be released
today.
    The pilots earlier this week offered to buy the airline for
2.3 billion dlrs, and assume 2.2 billion dlrs of existing debt.
    Takeover speculation has driven UAL's stock for several
weeks. UAL last month said New York Real estate developer
Donald Trump held a position in its stock, and that he also
held discussions with its chairman.
    The developer indicated in those talks that he took the
position as an investment, but he revealed no other plans.
    Today, rumors circulated that Coniston Partners were buying
UAL stock. UAL jumped five to 70-3/4 on volume of more than 3.2
mln shares.
    "United has got to consider this proposal. I think the
pilot's proposal is realistic. I don't exptect them to take it,
but it could put some interesting options in front of UAL
management," said Timothy Pettee, Bear Stearns and co analyst.
    Analysts have said UAL made itself vulnerable to attack
when it diversified away from its core airline. It added Hertz
rental cars, Westin and Hilton International hotels in a
strategy to become a travel service company.
    The strategy left its stock in a slump and its pilots union
concerned that the company was not focussing enough attention
on its airline.
    UAL has stood firm on its strategy. It is emphasizing its
new focus by changing its name to Allegis, as of May one.
    But takeover speculation has escalated, and Wall Street has
been busy calculating break up values well in excess of 100
dlrs per share. Traders today described the buying in UAL as
widespread, indicative to them that big institutions believe
the stock is in play.
    Market sources have said that although Trump attracted
attention to the stock, the pilots proposal acted as a
catalyst, kicking off a new round of speculation and perhaps
throwing the company into the hands of another buyer.
    "The first domino is you have an investor with a
considerable stake. the second domino is the union. That type
of attitude has been a precursor to airline deals in the past,"
said Pettee.
    "What's interesting is the values are there. There's
something for everybody," he said.

    The letter of intent signed by Chrysler and Renault on
March nine set April nine as the target date for completing
negotiations.
    However, the letter also allowed room for an extension of
that date to April 23 if an agreement could not be reached.
    The two companies said they "now plan to complete work by
April 23."
    Chrysler and Renault said, "Given the complex nature of the
deal, the need for additional time was to be expected."
    The March letter of intent between the two companies says
that Chrysler could ask Renault to extend the agreement date
"in the event that prior to April 9, 1987, Chrysler discovers
an unforeseen problem in the course of its 'due diligence'
investigation of the company," referring to American Motors.
    A Chrysler spokeswoman would not say whether some problem
had cropped up in the talks. She stuck by the company's
statement that more time was needed because the talks are
complex. "That is our definition of the delay," she said.
    Under the previous agreement between Chrysler and Renault,
their letter of intent would be terminated on April nine or
when an agreement was reached. But the letter could be amendend
by a written agreement by both companies.
    The Chrysler spokeswoman said, "We are still working toward
a definitive agreement." Said another Chrysler official who is
not part of the talks but who would be told if the deal were in
trouble: "There are no glitches."

of more than 4.5 billion dlrs by July 1, 1987, when an interim
debt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defer
substantial payments to creditors will expire.
    Analysts said TransCanada's bid signals Dome's debtholders
that an alternative exists to Dome's debt plan.
    Dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well as
public noteholders in March after several months of delicate
negotiations.
    TransCanada's proposal "amounts to a quasi debt
restructuring," oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin Nisker
Ltd said from Toronto.
    Calgary-based Dome's restructuring plan would allow
creditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yet
to be negotiated. Payments on remaining debt would be linked to
cash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt.
    "The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is that
even with approval of creditors, there is no assurance that
Dome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,"
said Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd in
Calgary.
    TransCanada's announcement came as a surprise since Dome
was waiting for responses from creditors on its proposed
refinancing packages, Gobert said.
    The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Dome
since other potential buyers were probably waiting for lenders
to agree to a restructuring, he added.
    "I would think that the debtholders would want to entertain
any and all offers (for Dome)," Gobert said.
    Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York that
TransCanada's announcement could be seen as an attempt to fix
the bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude other
possible buyers from making an offer. "By drawing attention to
us in our discussions, it means that others may be a little
reluctant to come forward," he said.
    Dome does not consider TransCanada's proposal a formal
offer because the pipeline utility's announcement breached a
confidential agreement between the two companies, he said.
    Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussions
with TransCanada in order to pursue talks with other
unidentified parties. However, Dome said its management and
financial advisers would evaluate all proposals, including
TransCanada's.
    Gowland said TransCanada's offer is probably a fair price
for the company's 36.1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings.
    However, he said not enough financial details are known
about Dome's debt restructuring to compare the value of
TransCanada's proposed offer.

unwanted offer from GAF Corp <GAF>, agreed to a 4.23 billion
dlr buyout offer from a company to be formed by <Merrill Lynch
Capital Partners Inc>.
    Borg-Warner and Merrill said yesterday they entered a
definitive merger agreement, under which a subsidiary of the
new company, <AV Holdings Corp>, will begin a 48.50 dlr per
share cash tender offer today for 77.6 mln shares or 89 pct of
Borg-Warner common stock.
    The offer will be followed by a merger in which each
remaining share will be converted into 19.75 dlrs cash and
54.25 dlrs principal amount of AV Holdings junior subordinated
discount debentures.
    As a result of the merger, Borg-Warner will become a wholly
owned subsidiary of AV Holdings. A Borg-Warner spokeswoman said
members of management do not plan to participate in the
transaction, but they will retain their positions with the
company.
    A spokesman for GAF was unavailable for comment. GAF holds
19.9 pct of Borg-Warner's shares.
    GAF had said it would offer 46 dlrs per share.
    Borg-Warner's spokeswoman said the company still plans to
sell its financial services unit, which includes Wells Fargo
security guards, and the Chilton Corp, a credit rating service.
    Borg-Warner has been the focus of takeover speculation for
about a year. Corporate raider Irwin Jacobs last year proposed
a takeover of the firm and until recently held 10 pct of the
stock. Following the GAF offer, analysts had calculated breakup
values for the company in the low 50 dlrs per share range and
speculated an offer would have to be sweetened.
    In its statement, Borg-Warner said its board endorsed the
Merrill offer and it recommended that shareholders tender their
shares. The board received opinions on the offer from its
advisors, First Boston Corp and Goldman, Sachs and Co.
    James Burke, president of Merrill Lynch Capital Partners,
said, "We are very pleased to have entered into this transaction
with Borg-Warner. We are looking forward to working with the
employees of Borg-Warner and to Borg-Warner maintaining its
strong presence in the Chicago community."
    Merrill Lynch will be the dealer-manager for the offer,
which expires at midnight EDT May 8 (0400 GMT, May 9), subject
to conditions, including the completion of necessary financing
arrangements.
    The offer is also subject to a minimum 44.25 mln shares, or
51 pct of the outstanding shares, being tendered.
    Merrill Lynch and certain affiliates have committed to
provide 200 mln dlrs in AV Holdings equity and 870 mln in
subordinated financing and forward underwriting commitments.
    Merrill Lynch said that following discussions with
commercial banks it is confident it can obtain the rest of the
financing required to complete the transaction.
    The junior subordinated discount debentures to be issued in
the merger will carry a 13 pct coupon and will begin paying
cash interest after five years.
    The debentures will be redeemable at the company's option
for the first six years at 105 pct, during the seventh year at
102.5 pct and after that at 100 pct of the principal amount.
    The junior subordinated discount debentures have a maturity
of 20 years and are entitled to a sinking fund commencing in
the 16th year designed to retire 60 pct of the issue before
maturity.
    Borg-Warner will also redeem all of its outstanding 4.50
dlrs cumulative preferred stock, series A, for 100 dlrs per
share. Holders who wish to participate in the offer must first
convert their preferred stock into Borg-Warner common stock.
    The board of Borg-Warner has also taken steps to redeem its
poison pill or share purchase rights for five cents per right,
effective immediately.

debt-burdened Dome Petroleum Ltd <DMP.MO> as TransCanada
PipeLines Ltd <TRP.TO> announced a 4.3 billion dlr offer and
Dome said it is continuing talks with other possible buyers.
    Companies mentioned in market speculation as potential
buyers for Dome include Imperial Oil Ltd <IMO.A> which is 70
pct owned by Exxon Corp <XON.N>, <PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd>
which is 87 pct owned by the conglomerate Canadian Pacific Ltd
<CP.N> and British Petroleum Co Plc <BP.L>.
    Along with the TransCanada offer, Dome has had another
proposal from "a substantial company" and discussions with a
third company which could lead to an offer, Dome said in a
statement.
    The statement confirmed Dome received TransCanada's bid,
but did not identify the companies involved in talks.
    TransCanada, Canada's largest natural gas pipeline
operator, said it is offering Dome a package of cash, common
and preferred shares, and shares in a new subsidiary which
would own and operate Dome's assets. TransCanada said the offer
is to Dome management, not to shareholders.
    Dome has massive oil and gas landholdings in Canada,
totalling 36.1 mln acres of which 7.4 mln have been developed.
It also has tax credits worth about 2.5 billion dlrs.
    Dome's statement said the TransCanada announcement "violated
the terms and spirit of a confidentiality agreement entered
into with prospective purchasers" and was apparently timed to
prevent Dome from considering other proposals.
    It said the TransCanada bid "seems to require favourable and
substantial taxation concessions from the federal and
provincial governments." But Dome added that its management and
financial advisers will evaluate all proposals.
    TransCanada chief financial officer H. Neil Nichols said he
was surprised at the vehemence of Dome's statement and denied
that TransCanada was trying to usurp other bids. "I find (Dome's
statement) very bothersome. Once the board made the decision to
authorise the proposal, it had a legal obligation to announce
it," he said. Nichols said he did not know the identity of the
other bidders, or the terms of other offers.
    Dome common shares closed at 1.13 dlrs on Friday on the
Toronto Stock Exchange. The preferred class A stock closed at
5.00 dlrs. Common stock traded as high as 25.00 dlrs in 1981.

at a price of 42 dlrs 0.01 preferred share for each common
share held.  The rights will expire April Nine.
    The company said the rights would be exercisable 20
business days after a party were to acquire 20 pct or more of
Crazy Eddie common stock or announce a tender or exchange offer
that would result in ownership of 30 pct or more.
    Crazy Eddie said if a party owning 20 pct or more of its
stock were to merge into it or if a party were to acquire 40
pct or more of Crazy Eddie stock, right holders other than the
acquiring party would be entitled to acquire common shares or
other securities or assets with a market value equal to twice
the rights' exercise price.
    If after a party acquired 20 pct or more of its stock Crazy
Eddie were acquired or 50 pct of its earnings power or assets
sold, rightholders other than the acquirer would be entitled to
buy shares of the acquirer's common stock worth twice the
rights' exercise price, the company said.
    Crazy Eddie said if a party were to acquire 30 pct or more
of its common stock and then fail to acquire Crazy Eddie within
180 days thereafter, rightholders would be entitled to exchange
their Crazy Eddie common stock for subordinated notes of Crazy
Eddie maturing either one year or, above a certain dollar limt,
five years after issuance.
    Crazy Eddie said adoption of the plan is not in response to
any known effort to acquire control of it.  But the company
said it has become aware of some "possible accumulations" of
its stock has has received some "friendly inquiries."

may short-circuit Dome's restructuring plan and open the door

raised his offer for Caesars World Inc shares to 32 dlrs each
from 28 dlrs and has reduced the number of shares he is seeking
to 29.1 mln from all those not already owned.
    In a newspaper advertisement, Sosnoff said the bid by his
MTS Acquisition Corp, withdrawal rights and the proration
period will now expire June 19 unless extended. The offer had
been scheduled to expire May 15. In late March, Sosnoff said he
had received a "negligible" number of shares in response to the
offer, which had been rejected by Caesars as inadequate.
    Sosnoff already owns about four mln of Caesars' 30 mln
common shares now outstanding, or a 13.3 pct interest on a
primary basis.
    Last week, Caesars' board approved a recapitalization plan
as an alternative to the Sosnoff offer under which shareholders
would receive a special dividend of 25 dlrs per share, subject
to approval by shareholders at a special meeting to be held in
June.
    The company planned to borrow 200 mln dlrs and sell 800 mln
dlrs in debt to finance the payout.
    Sosnoff said in the newspaper advertisement that the
amended offer is conditioned on receipt of enough shares to
give him a majority interest on a fully diluted basis and on
the arrangement of financing, as well as to approvals by New
Jersey and Nevada gaming authorities.
    He said the tender would be the first step in acquiring all
of Caesars' shares and if successful would be followed by a
merger transaction.
    Sosnoff said later in a statement that the 29.1 mln shares
he is now seeking, together with the 4,217,675 shares he owns,
would give him a 92.4 pct interest on a fully diluted basis.
    He said he still has received only a "negligible" number of
shares in response to his tender.
    In a letter to Caesars' chairman Henry Gluck included in
the statement, Sosnoff said Gluck had again refused, on April
8, to meet with him, even though he had said he was willing to
increase the price of his offer.
    Sosnoff said the financing for the offer is almost fully in
place.
    Sosnoff said PaineWebber Group Inc <PWJ> has now delivered
to him commitments to purchase up to 475 mln dlrs of increasing
dividend cumulative exchangeable preferred stock of MTS Holding
Corp, an indirect parent corporation of MTS Acquisition.
    He said Marine Midland Banks Inc <MM>, which leads a
syndicate that has provided commitments for a 500 mln dlr
margin facility, believes it will be able to arrange for
further commitments under the margin facility to advance up to
an additional 25 mln dlrs that may be needed to permit the
purchase of shares under the offer.
    Sosnoff said under the merger that would follow his tender,
each of the 2,750,000 Caesars shares not covered by the offer,
or 7.6 pct on a fully diluted basis, would be converted into
Series A preferred stock valued at 32 dlrs per shareby an
independent investment baking firm.
    He said "To the extent that fewer than 29,100,000 sdhares
are purchased in the offer, the stockholders would receive a
combination of cash and Series A preferred stock having a value
of 32 dlrs per share of Caesars."
    Sosnoff said he believes terms of his offer are superior to
Caesars' recapitalization.
    Sosnoff said he will be meeting this week with gaming
officials in Nevada in an effort to expedite the investigatory
process required for regulatory approval, a process that it
already underway in New Jersey.
    He said his offer has been extended based on the likely
duration of the regulatory process.
    He said he intends to further extend the offer if the
approval process is not completed by the expiration date.

shares of Reebok common. Reebok will sell three mln shares and
Pentland will sell 1,404,866 shares, reducing its stake in
Reebok to 18.1 mln from 19.5 mln shares.
    After the offering, Reebok will have 56.1 mln shares shares

stockholders who will offer about 1.6 mln shares of Reebok
common, and the underwriters.

Allied can receive from its other divisions."

Corp's valuable plastics business, is believed by analysts to
be preparing an increased offer for the Chicago-based company.
     Yesterday, Borg-Warner said it agreed to be acquired for
4.23 billion dlrs by a company to be formed by Merrill Lynch
Capital Partners. Merrill offered 48.50 dlrs cash per share for
89 pct of Borg-Warner's common stock, and a package of cash and
securities for the balance.
    Borg-Warner stock rose 1-3/8 to 49-5/8.
    "I think it's (the stock price) telling us GAF is coming in
with another bid," said one analyst, who values the company at
51 or 52 dlrs per share.
    GAF has offered 46 dlrs per share. It holds 19.9 pct of
Borg-Warner's stock.
    "You're in a cat and mouse game on how you're going to up
the price. Obviously, nobody wants to pay more than you have
to. I think GAF is looking at the company the way we're looking
at it - that it's worth more," Pershing and Co analyst Richard
Henderson said.
    Henderson estimated it is worth abouth 55 dlrs per share.
    GAF has only said it was reviewing the situation. Merrill
Lynch officials did not return phone calls.
    Analysts have said they believe GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman
sought Borg-Warner because of its chemicals and plastics
business. The rigid plastics are used in such things as
telephones, computer terminals, and appliances.
    "Where the heck can you buy a world class chemical
operation these days," said Henderson.
    "He's (Heyman's) got the bucks. He's a heavy hitter, and he
does not like to get pushed around," said Henderson.
    GAF, a roofing and chemicals concern, attempted a takeover
of the much larger Union Carbide Corp two years ago. While GAF
did not win the company, it made a substantial gain on its
investment in Carbide.
    Analysts said GAF already has a large profit built into its
Borg-Warner holdings. They said even if GAF raises its offer
and does not succeed, a higher bid from another company would
give GAF millions of dollars in profits on its stock.
    "It's a win-win situation," said one analyst.
    One analyst speculated an offer from GAF would be
forthcoming shortly.
    "I think we are finally down to the final paragraph in this
book," he said.
    Borg-Warner's other businesses include automotive parts,
protective services, which includes Wells Fargo security
guards, and Chilton Corp, a credit rating service.
    Charles Rose, an Oppenheimer and Co analyst who follows
GAF, said if GAF were to sell into the Merrill Lynch offer, it
would realize about 125 mln dlrs net profit, or about 3.50 per
share.
    "I think there's a probability he goes up in price," said
Rose.
    Rose said, however, he could not really predict what Heyman
would do. "Sam's a low-risk, high-return player."
    "Is he trying to build a major industrial chemical
enterprise, or is he trying to be an investment bank," Rose
said.
    Analysts said Borg-Warner's chemical business would add
earnings momentum to GAF. "I worked out that paying as much as
50 dlrs per share would still be additive to GAF in time, if
they sold off most of the non-chemical facilities," said John
Henry of E.F. Hutton.
    Borg-Warner's chemical and plastics business provided 1986
operating profits of 153.3 mln dlrs on revenues of 1.04 billion
dlrs. Total operating profits were 349.7 mln dlrs, and net
earnings were 206.3 mln dlrs for 1986.
    "The Borg chemical business is great," said Rose, adding
its only U.S. competitors are Monsanto Co <MCT> and Dow
Chemical Co <DOW>.

their biggest gain in months in the U.S. and Canada as stock
markets foresaw a takeover tug-of-war beginning for the
debt-heavy company.
    Dome rose 1/4 to 1-1/8 on the American Stock Exchange and
gained 31 cents to 1.44 Canadian dlrs on the Toronto Stock
Exchange, where it was the most active stock. It rose as high
as 1.50 dlrs in Toronto during the day. In recent months, Dome
has normally moved by only a few cents per day.
    TransCanada PipeLines yesterday announced a 4.3 billion dlr
Canadian (3.22 billion U.S.) bid for all of Dome's assets, but
Dome, which is based in Calgary, Alberta, said it is also still
talking with two other companies, which it refuses to identify.
    Market analysts today said the other two firms are believed
to be foreign oil companies, noting that TransCanada yesterday
stressed that its bid is "a Canadian solution to the financial
difficulties of Dome Petroleum."
    "The talk is about Conoco, which is controlled by DuPont
<DD>, and Atlantic Richfield Co <ARC>, which sold its Canadian
interest in 1975 and could be getting back in," said Wilf Gobert
of Peters and Co Ltd.
    David Bryson of Moss Lawson and Co also noted that British
Petroleum PLC <BP> is mentioned as a possible buyer, despite
BP's 70 U.S. dlr per share bid two weeks ago for the 45 percent
of Standard Oil Co <SRD> it does not already own.
    Calgary-based independent analyst James Hamilton has said
in recent reports that Amoco Corp <AN> has also been in talks
with Dome.
    Representatives of Atlantic Richfield, British Petroleum,
Conoco and Amoco were not immediately available for comment.
    Gobert characterized the market action in Dome today as "awfully
optimistic," given TransCanada's offer to give current Dome
shareholders stock in a new subsidiary, which it valued at 1.10
dlrs Canadian per common share.
    Under the offer, current Dome common and preferred
shareholders would own 20 pct of the new subsidiary, which
would own and operate all Dome's former assets. TransCanada
would own 80 pct.
    However, Bryson said the market may be looking at the
potential for shares in a publicly-traded subsidiary. "The
TransCanada offer has quite a bit of upside potential for Dome,"
he said.
    Gobert said he believes the TransCanada offer is "at the
upper end of what I thought somebody would pay for Dome."
    The TransCanada proposal would pay Dome's creditors 3.87
billion Canadian dlrs (2.90 billion U.S. dlrs), with another
one billion Canadian dlrs (750 mln U.S. dlrs) available to
secured creditors if the Dome subsidiary earns profits above a
certain level. TransCanada would not detail the profit level.
    Dome currently is seeking to restructure about six billion
Canadian dlrs (4.5 billion U.S. dlrs) in debt, which it took on
several years ago when oil prices were high and the company
wanted to expand.
    "There has been speculation that Dome's assets are capable
of supporting debt of three to four billion dlrs, so on that
basis, the TransCanada offer would be at the upper end of that,"
Gobert said.
    Dome's debt troubles have often obscured the fact that it
is a major player in the Canadian oil and gas field. It holds
reserves of about 176 mln barrels of crude oil and 3.9 billion
cubic feet of natural gas.
    The company also owns or has an interest in 14.2 mln acres
of oil and gas exploration land in the province of Alberta, the
heart of Canada's oil industry.
   Dome owns or has an interest in a total of 36.1 mln acres of
land across Canada.
   The company also has tax credits of about 2.5 billion dlrs
Canadian (1.9 billion dlrs U.S.). It reported a 1986 loss of
2.2 billion dlrs (1.65 billion dlrs U.S.), believed to be the
largest ever by a Canadian company.

subsidiary seeking to take over of Borg-Warner Corp said it
could realize a 30 mln dlr fee for its efforts, whether or not
the deal, which it values at 4.7 billion dlrs, succeeds.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Merrill Lynch Capital Partners Inc said it would receive a 30
mln dlr fee from the surviving company for acting as dealer
manager of the merger after the Borg-Warner deal is completed.
    But it said it could also receive a break-up fee of 30 mln
dlrs if the deal fails for reasons, which include another party
holding more than 40 pct of its stock or tendering for 50 pct.
    The 30 mln dlr fee is among the highest set down in any
tender offer agreement, either in compensation for dealer
manager services or for break-up of the deal.
    Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, backed by a group of
investors it organized, has launched a 48.50 dlr a share tender
offer for Borg-Warner for 90 pct of its stock.
    The company's board has approved the plan, which was
intended to thwart an unsolicited offer from GAF Corp.
    Borg-Warner also agreed to redeem all outstanding Series A
preferred shares and to pay off on all options at a 48.50 dlr a
share exercise price before the merger is effective, it said.
    Merrill Lynch said its representatives discussed a possible
leveraged buyout with Borg-Warner as early as last December.
    At that time, Merrill Lynch told the company it would
consider a 43 dlr a share tender offer in cash and securities,
if the Borg-Warner board approved, it said. On Feb 24, it said
it was told the company had decided against a buyout.
    But talks were revived after GAF launched its 46 dlr a
share proposal on March 31, Merrill Lynch said.
    Unlike its earlier proposal, Merrill Lynch said Borg-Warner
management was asked not to take part in the new deal and it
was conditioned upon payment of the fees.
    In addition to its fees, Merrill Lynch said it will also
get up to 17 mln dlrs from Borg-Warner to cover its expenses in
the tender offer.
    Merrill Lynch said it would continue operating Borg-Warner
as a subsidiary with its current officers keeping their
positions.
    But for flexibility purposes, Merrill Lynch said it is
considering redistributing Borg-Warner's assets to a number of
subsdiaries of an entity it created to carry out the merger.
    All in all Merrill Lynch estimated that there would be 130
mln dlrs in fees and expenses connected with the deal.
    Another 250 mln dlrs will be needed to repay certain debt
of Borg-Warner, Merrill Lynch said.
    To finance the deal, Merrill Lynch said it expects to
borrow 3.5 billion dlrs from a group of banks and sell 100 mln
dlrs of common stock of the new company, sell 100 mln dlrs of
non-voting preferred stock of the new company to Merrill Lynch
and Co, sell up to 650 mln dlrs of subordinated notes to
Merrill Lynch and Co and sell to the public 204 mln dlrs of
subordinated discount debentures.
    GAF has raised its offer to 48 dlrs a share cash.

bidder for debt-laden Dome Petroleum Ltd, according to a
published report.
    The Toronto Globe and Mail, quoting sources close to the
negotiations, today said Dome broke off talks last night with
TransCanada PipeLines Ltd, which last week announced a 4.3
billion Canadian dlr offer for all of Dome's assets.
    No financial details about the Amoco offer were available
and a Dome spokesman would neither confirm nor deny that Amoco
had emerged the winner, the newspaper said.
    However, the Dome spokesman indicated that the sale of Dome
could be finalized and announced this weekend, the Globe and
Mail said.
    Representatives of Amoco were not immediately available for
comment.
    Last Sunday, when TransCanada announced its offer, Dome
said it was also in talks with two other companies, but refused
to identify them.
    Since then, market speculation has centered on Amoco and
Exxon Corp's <XON> 70 pct-owned Imperial Oil Ltd subsidiary in
Canada.
    British Petroleum PLC <BP> and Royal Dutch/Shell Group <RD>
have also been mentioned as possible suitors for Dome.
    In the past two days, Dome management has been pressured by
the federal government to select the offer from TransCanada,
the only Canadian company in the bidding.
    Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's government appears to want
to avoid a Dome sale to a foreign company since the government
gave Dome hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks to
encourage oil and gas exploration in the Arctic, analysts and
officials have said.
    A purchase by TransCanada would be least likely to run
afoul of Canadian antitrust laws, however, TransCanada is
asking for tax concessions from a federal government that is
trying to hold its deficit below 30 billion Canadian dlrs,
analysts have said.
    A takeover by Amoco or Imperial would also give a foreign
oil company a dominant position in Canada's oil industry.
    Imperial Oil is already Canada's largest energy company,
with 1986 revenues of 7.1 billion Canadian dlrs. Chicago-based
Amoco had 1986 revenues of 20.23 billion U.S. dlrs. Its Amoco
Canada Petroleum subsidiary is 100 pct owned by Amoco Corp.

decision, ruled that an Indiana law aimed at protecting
companies from hostile takeovers by out-of-state businesses is
constitutional.
    The high court justices reversed a ruling by a U.S. Court
of Appeals in Chicago that struck down the 1986 control-share
acquisition law.
    The case involved a hostile takeover bid by Dynamics Corp
of America against CTS Corp, based in Elkhart, Ind.
    Dynamics made a tender offer in 1985 for one million shares
to bring its holdings of CTS stock to 27.5 pct of the company's
total.
   
    After CTS invoked the state law, Dynamics filed a lawsuit
challenging the constitutionality of the measure.
    One effect of the law is to impose a 50-day delay on the
tender offer at the option of the target company.
    It also requires that the acquisition for control shares in
an Indiana corporation does not include voting rights unless a
majority of all pre-existing shareholders so agree at their
next regularly scheduled meeting.
    Justice Lewis Powell, writing for the court majority, held
that the state law was not pre-empted by federal securities
law.
   
    "The Indiana Act protects independent shareholders from the
coercive aspects of tender offers by allowing them to vote as a
group," he said.
    He acknowledged that the law may delay some tender offers
and may decrease the number of successful tender offers for
Indiana corporations.
    But he said the law does not discriminate against
interstate commerce and was justified by the state's interests
in protecting shareholders.

is investment adviser, said it has agreed to limit further
purchases of Fairchild Industries Inc stock.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Quantum, which already holds 1,647,481 Fairchild common shares,
or 11.5 pct of the total outstanding, said it agreed to the
restriction after Fairchild said its security clearance might
be jeopardized if Quantum acquires a major stake in it.
    But Quantum said Fairchild management was told that Soros,
acting either individually or through entities other than
Quantum that he controls, may decide to buy common stock in the
company on his own behalf.
    Quantum had recently notified the Federal Trade Commission
under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976
that it might buy up to 49.9 pct of Fairchild's voting stock.
Unless the FTC had objected, Quantum would have been free, but
not obligated, to buy up to 49.9 pct of Fairchild stock.
    Fairchild management, however, warned that if Quantum, a
foreign entity, raises its stake in the company to 49.9 pct, it
could "impair" the government security clearances Fairchild
needs to carry out its its defense contract work.
    In response, Quantum said it told Fairchild it will not
make "significant additional purchases" of its common or
preferred stock without giving Fairchild enough prior notice to
enable it to consult with Quantum over the impact of action.
    Quantum also said it has withdrawn its notification request
to the FTC and the antitrust division of the Justice Department
of its intent to buy up to 49.9 pct of Fairchild.
    Quantum also said it told the FTC and the Justice
Department that it does not expect to resubmit any further
notifications of intent to significantly raise its stake in
Fairchild at this time.
    The restrictions Quantum has agreed to follow regarding
further dealings in Fairchild stock do not apply to Soros as an
individual investor.
     Fairchild's annual shareholders meeting is scheduled to be
held tomorrow.

    The company said Rockwell had agreed to handle Soma sales
around the world and to help Valeo in restructuring its
loss-making subsidiary.
    It also said Rockwell, an American high-technology
engineering group with interests in aerospace and the car
industry, would take control of Soma at the beginning of 1988
if it obtained approval from the French government.
    Soma, a fully owned subsidiary of Valeo, makes axles and
gear boxes for heavy vehicles and machinery mostly used in the
construction business. A Valeo spokesman said <S.E.S.M.>, a
subsidiary of Soma specialized in equipment for military
vehicles, had been excluded from the agreement with Rockwell.
     He said no details were available on the eventual amount
Rockwell would pay for Soma.
    Vehicle components maker Valeo was the object of a takeover
bid in 1986 by Italian group <Compagnie Industriali Riunite>
(CIR), controlled by Olivetti chairman Carlo de Benedetti.
    The French government limited CIR's holding in Valeo to
less than 30 pct in June 1986, after classifying Valeo as a
defence contractor. Today CIR has effective control of Valeo
through its French holding company <Compagnies Europeenes
Reunies>, Cerus, which has a 18.24 pct stake in Valeo.
    Since CIR won control of the French group in June, Valeo
has pursued a policy of concentrating its activities on the car
industry. The company spokesman said Valeo had sold off all its
construction interests in 1986 but declined to comment on the
amount of the sales.
    The spokesman said figures were not available on Soma's
losses in 1986 but said the company had registered a turnover
of 546 mln francs. Valeo recorded a consolidated net loss of
388 mln francs in 1986 on a turnover of 12.1 billion francs.

3.50 dlrs a share cum-bonus for all the issued capital of
building products group Monier Ltd <MNRA.S>.
    The offer values Monier's current issued capital of 156.28
mln shares at 547 mln dlrs and compares with the latest share
market price of 2.80 dlrs, equal to last Friday's close.
    Monier recently said it proposes to make a one-for-two
bonus issue before June 30.
    CSR will shortly announce further details of the offer
including a CSR share alternative, it said in a statement.
    CSR said it currently holds 323,000 Monier shares or only
0.21 pct of the company's issued capital.
    Redland Plc <RDLD.L>, the holder of 49.87 pct of Monier,
has agreed with CSR that Redland will not accept the offer for
its stake initially, CSR said.
    Instead, CSR has granted Redland two alternative options,
the first giving Redland the right to accept the CSR offer at
the same price within six months of the closing date of the
bid, the company said.
    The second grants Redland the option to increase its Monier
holding to 50.1 pct in the same period.
    The second option is exercisable by Redland at 3.50 dlrs a
share, CSR said.
    Both option deals are subject to the approval of Monier
shareholders except CSR and Redland.
    As previously reported, Redland and Monier had been
discussing a possible Redland bid for Monier but the talks
broke off two weeks ago.
    CSR said Redland supports the CSR offer as a means of
establishing a fruitful joint venture in building materials in
which they both have interests. At the end of the offer, they
will discuss how these interests may be developed.
    Redland has indicated that it would be prepared to consider
at a later stage an increase in CSR's Monier stake to enable it
to become a CSR subsidiary, assuming Redland exercises the
second option, CSR said.
    It said the offer is generous because it will give Monier
shareholders a price equivalent to 16.8 times after-tax
earnings in 1985/86 ended June 30, a 25 pct premium over
Friday's market price and a 125 pct premium over last reported
net tangible asset backing per share of 1.57 dlrs.
    The offer is beneficial for both CSR and Monier
shareholders, CSR's chief executive officer Bryan Kelman said.
    "The acquisition will broaden CSR interests in building
materials by the addition of complementary domestic and
overseas businesses in concrete and clay tiles, metal roofing
materials and concrete blocks and piping," Kelman said in the
statement.
    "Importantly, the acquisition will provide CSR with new
growth opportunities in building materials both in Australia
and overseas," he added.
    Monier, which earned a net 32.49 mln dlrs in 1985/86, has
operations in a number of countries, including the U.S., Japan,
Britain and New Zealand, as well as Australia.

the company's stock from Ciba-Geigy Ltd <CIGZ.Z>, which already
holds 18.8 pct of the stock.
    Spectra-Physics said it also filed a lawsuit in Delaware
federal court this morning seeking to enjoin the offer and
alleging, among other things, that the offer vilates federal
securities laws, certain agreements between Ciba-Geigy and
Spectra-Physics, and Ciba-Geigy's fiduciary duties.
    Spectra-Physics said the two Ciba-Geigy designess to its
board were not present at yesterday's special meeting which
voted to reject the offer as financially inadequate, unfair and
not in the best interests of Spectra-Physics or its
stockholders.
    The company said the board also authorized a special
committee of outside directors to take whatever steps it deems
necessary to protect the interests of Spectra-Physics and its
stockholders and to investigate all alternatives to maximize
the value of the stock, including talks with third parties.
    Spectra-Physics said a letter communicating the board's
recommendation and reasons therefore is being mailed to
stockholders.
    It said Robert Bruce, Reliance Group Holdings Inc's <REL>
designee on Spectra-Physics' board, resigned his position on
May 29. His letter of resignation said the action was to
alleviate Ciba-Geigy's stated justification for making the
unsolicited offer that it had not contemplated another
significant investor having representation on the board when
its Spectra-Physics' investment was made.

said they reached an agreement for Boeing to acquire the
Sunnyvale, Calif., defense electronics firm for about 275 mln
dlrs.
    The boards of both companies have approved the merger,
which will be accomplished through a tender offer by a Boeing
subsidiary of 37 dlrs a share cash for all of ARGOSystems'
shares, the companies said.
    Under the agreement, the Boeing subsidiary, TBC Holdings
Corp, will begin the tender offer promptly. If at least 90 pct
of the shares are not tendered, the offer will be prorated to
49 pct, the companies said.
    ARGOSystems has granted Boeing an option to buy 1,238,311
shares or 18.5 pct of the outstanding stock for 37 dlrs a
share, they said.
    Also, Bill May, chairman of ARGOSystems, and three other
officers have granted Boeing an option to buy their shares,
another 8.9 pct of the outstanding stock, for 37 dlrs a share.
    ARGOSystems makes equipment to monitor and analyze military
communications signals, electronic warfare equipment to monitor
and jam radar signals and signal processing systems.
    For the nine months ended March 31, 1987, ARGOSystems
reported earnings more than doubled to 6.3 mln dlrs or 95 cts a
share from 3.1 mln dlrs or 46 cts. The year-ago period included
a 2.2 mln dlr charge from a writedown of securities. Sales rose
23.5 pct to 70.9 mln dlrs.
    Sales are expected to exceed 100 mln dlrs for the fiscal
year ending June 30, the companies said in a joint statement.
    The company's backlog is currently more than 180 mln dlrs,
they said. It has about 1,200 employees.
    About 30 pct of ARGOSystems' business comes from
international customers.
    "ARGOSystems is a clear leader in its field. This
association will expand our overall activities and
significantly enhance our ability to compete in the defense
electronics area," Boeing president Frank Shrontz said in a
statement.
    ARGOSystems will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of
Boeing Co.
    The merger following the tender offer will be subject to
approval by ARGOSystems shareholders, the companies said.
    The tender offer and merger are subject to customary
conditions and expiration of the Hart-Scott-Rodino notification
waiting period, they said.

two proposals in response to its previously announced
solicitation of potential buyers for the company.
    The company said it is evaluating the proposals from Paul
Bilzerian and from a third party which is active in the
leveraged buyout field but which Pay N' Pak declined to
identify.
    It said the Bilzerian proposal calls for shareholders to
receive on a blended basis 16.67 dlrs in cash and 3.30 dlrs in
liquidation value of cumulative exchangeable redeemable
preferred stock for each common share.
   
    Pay N' Pak said the second proposal is structured as a
merger in which each holder would receive a combination of
17.50 dlrs in cash and 2.50 dlrs in liquidation value of 13-1/2
pct cumulative preferred.
    The company said the dividend on the preferred offered by
Bilzerian would be set so that in the opinion his financial
advisor and the company's financial advisor the preferred would
trade in the public market at its liquidation value.
    Dividends on the preferred could be paid at the option of
the surviving corporation in cash or additional shares of
preferred for the first five years, it added..
   
    Pay N' Pak said Bilzerian's proposal is subject to a
physical inventory of merchandise at June 30. Bilzerian did not
provide details with respect to financing of his proposal,
which is not subject to a financing condition.
    The company said dividends on the preferred being offered
in the second proposal would be paid in additional preferred in
the first three years and the preferred would be redeemed in
years 12 and 13.
    It said the second offer is contingent on the arrangement
of financing, adding the party making the offer is confident of
its ability to obtain the balance of the financing.
   
    Pay N' Pak said the second proposal is conditioned upon a
satisfactory agreement with the company's management regarding
its equity participation in the new company.
    The second party anticipates executing a letter of intent
when it delivers its financing commitment to the Pay N' Pak
board that would incorporate an expense reinbursement and

Printing and Communicaton Corp PLC said it filed a lawsuit in
U.S. district court against Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc, its
directors and advisers to stop, among other things, payment of
the special dividend Harcourt is paying as part of its
recapitalization.
    The suit, filed in Manhattan, also names First Boston Corp
<FBC> and seeks to void the issue by Harcourt of 40,000 shares
of super voting preferred stock to First Boston Securities Corp
and the issue of convertible voting preferred stock with
4,700,000 votes in the Harcourt employee stock ownership plan.
    The preferred shares to be issued to First Boston have
8,160,000 votes. The suit, brought derivatively on behalf of
Harcourt and individually in British Printing's capacity as a
substantial holder of Harcourt common shares and 6-3/8 pct
convertible debentures.
    The suit alleges Harcourt's special dividend exceeds by
more than one billion dlrs Harcout's surplus available for
dividends under New York law and contstitutes a fraudulent
conveyance.
    The lawsuit also alleges that Harcourt failed to disclose
that one consequence of the payment of the dividend, which it
terms illegal, will be that shareholders will be liable to
repay it.
    Harcourt last week said it would pay 40 dlrs per share to
stockholders as a special dividend. Harcourt also announced an
extensive recapitalization plan, which analysts said was aimed
at thwarting a takeover effort by British Printing.
    British Printing last week withdrew its 44 dlr per share,
or two billion dlr offer for Harcourt because of the
recapitalizaton plan. At the time, it said it was reviewing its
alternatives.
    British Printing said it filed the suit after consultation
with its advisers. Its lawsuit also alleges that Harcourt
failed to disclose the effect of the special dividend on
Harcourt 6-3/8 pct convertible debentures.
    British Printing alleges the effect will be an enormous
increase effective on the June eight record date for the
dividend in the number of Harcourt common shares issuable upon
conversion of the debentures. British Printing also charged 
Harcourt is unlawfully coercing debenture holders to convert
denbentures before the record date because Harcourt may not
have enough authorized common shares to honor conversion after
the date.
    British Printing holds 460,600 shares and 5.6 mln dlrs
worth of debentures.
    The suit also alleges that management, the board of
directors, and First Boston engaged in an illegal scheme of
entrenchment through a combination of selling to First Boston
Securities Corp the super voting preferred at a bargain price,
the grant to the company employee stock plan of convertible
voting preferred, the six mln share open market repurchase
program and the manner in which its financing has been
structured.

800 mln dlr merger with Uccel Corp <UCE> will eliminate its
strongest rival, but the company still faces stiff competition
from International Business Machines Corp <IBM>, Wall Street
analysts said.
     "IBM is still the ruling force in mainframe systems
software," said Scott Smith, an analyst with Donaldson Lufkin
and Jenrette.
    "But the combination of the two companies will clearly
present a much stronger front," he said.
    Besides IBM, "Computer Associates will be far and away the
most powerful company in the field," added E.F. Hutton analyst
Terence Quinn.
    That field is a segment of the market known as system
utilities, or software packages that boost the productivity of
a company's data processing facilities by increasing the speed,
power and efficiency of large mainframe computers.
    The merger of Uccel and Computer Associates combines the
two biggest systems utilities suppliers other than IBM.
Analysts said the remaining players are mostly small firms that
will find the competition much harder than in the past.
    For Computer Associates, the merger with Uccel caps a
six-year acquisition campaign that has vaulted the Garden City,
N.Y.-based company to the top of the software industry.
    When the deal is completed sometime in August, the
company's revenues will exceed 450 mln dlrs, pushing it past 
Microsoft Corp <MFST> as the world's largest independent
software vendor.
    Computer Associates founder and chairman Charles B. Wang
took the company public in 1981, and since then he has bought
15 companies and boosted annual sales from 18.5 mln to 309.3
mln dlrs for the year ended March 31.
    Liemandt took charge of Wyly, sold off its non-computer
businesses and decided that it would focus solely on mainframe
computer software. In 1984, the company was renamed Uccel Corp.
    Liemandt, who said he will leave the company after the
merger is completed, also turned to acquisitions for growth.
    On the last day of 1986, Uccel completed the buyouts of six
companies for a total of about 60 mln dlrs.
    For 1986, it earned 17.0 mln dlrs, or 1.01 dlrs a share, on
sales of 141.5 mln dlrs.
    The agreement took industry analysts by surprise, largely
because the companies had been such bitter rivals. Also,
Dallas-based Uccel had engineered a strong comeback from the
dark days of 1982, when, as Wyly Corp, it lost 7.7 mln dlrs, or
56 cts a share.
   At that time, Wyly owned a potpourri of 13 different
businesses, only three of which were involved in computer
software. In 1983, Walter Haefner, a Swiss financier and a
major Wyly investor, lured Gregory J. Liemandt away from his
job as chairman of General Electric Co's <GE> computer services
unit.
    Computer Associates' Wang and Uccel's Liemandt said at a
news conference that the merger would give computer users a
single source for a wide range of software products.
    In addition to system utilities, Computer Associates also
sell products for microcomputers, while Uccel has made inroads
in the applications software market, where analysts said it has
been successful with accounting and banking systems.
    Wang said Computer Associates would continue to support and
enhance both companies' product lines, but noted that the
company will eventually weed out duplicate offerings. He said
about 20 pct of the companies' products overlap.
    Analysts said the merger would dilute the holdings of
current Computer Associates shareholders by about 10 pct. But
they joined Wang in forecasting that the deal will not dilute
Computer Associates' earnings for the current fiscal year.
    Quinn of E.F. Hutton said Wang has a proven track record of
completing acquisitions without earnings dilution. Therefore,
he said he would not change his 1988 earnings estimate of 1.05
dlrs a share.
    Wang said he would look closely at the combined operations
of the two companies and cut duplication in sales, marketing
and research and development.
    Analysts said Computer Associates paid a premium for Uccel.
Based on Friday's closing price, the company will swap 47.50
dlrs worth of its stock for each Uccel share, which is nearly
33 times Uccel's 1987 estimated earnings of 1.45 dlrs a share.
    Stephen T. McClellan of Merrill Lynch Research said most
software companies are currently valued at about 20 times
per-share earnings. But the analyst said Uccel was worth the
premium because of its earnings potential and customer base.

    Wang said Haefner, the Swiss investor, would hold about 25
pct of Computer Associates stock after the merger. He currently
owns 58 pct of Uccel.
    The executive said the merger would not alter his target of
maintaining sales and earnings growth of 30 pct to 35 pct.
    In addition, he said he expects no problems in having the
deal cleared by the antitrust division of the U.S. Justice
Department.
    Uccel's Liemandt declined to say what he will do after the
merger, but he did not rule out working together with Wang.

Pak Stores Inc enters into a merger accord with him he will
immediately begin a tender offer for 7.5 mln shares for 20 dlrs
per share in cash.
    Bilzerian told Reuters he believes his offer is superior to
a leveraged buyout proposal disclosed in an announcement by the
company this morning.
    The company said it is evaluating both proposals.
Bilizerian said he was optimistic his offer will be accepted at
a meeting of the board of directors Wednesday. Officials of Pay
N' Pak did were not immediately available for comment.
 
    Bilzerian said he has a pool of 150 mln dlrs raised by
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc available for the tender and "we
may add a bank to that."
    "We've submitted an agreement we're prepared to sign," he
said. Shares not accepted in Bilzerian's tender would be
exchangeable for 20 dlrs in convertible preferred stock.
    Asked what would happen if the leveraged buyout group,
which the company did not identify, topped his offer between
now and the board meeting, Bilzerian said he expected an
opportunity to respond.
    Pay N' Pak gave no details about the buyout group, but did
say the offer was contingent on financing and on an agrreement
regarding management's equity participation.
    Bilzerian said it was his understanding that the management
particpation was "nominal."
    Pay N' Pak fell 1-1/2 to 19. Arbitrageurs said there was
disappointment that neither of the offers topped 20 dlrs.
    "We were expecting an offer north of (above) 21 or 22
dlrs," said one arbitrageur. The leveraged buyout plan was for
17.50 dlrs per share in cash and 2.50 dlrs in 13-1/2 pct
cumulative preferred stock.

    Robert Cheadle, analyst at Montgomery Securities, said "you
have to ask yourself why no one in the industry made a bid."
    Scott Drysdale, analyst at Birr Wilson Securities, said the
company has not made the best strategic moves over the years.
"They have not done the right things at the right time," he
said, and as a result earnings per share have steadily declined
since 1984. The 57 cts per share in earnings reported for the
fiscal year ended in February was lower than 1978's earnings,
he said. Earnings totaled 5.7 mln dlrs on revenue of 398.4 mln
dlrs.
    Drysdale said Pay N' Pak has better trained sales people
than many competitors, but it competes on price even though
competitors have lower costs. The result is squeezed margins.
He noted that there have been no other publicly identified
bidders stepping forward since the company rejected an earlier
Bilzerian proposal in mid-April.
    Another arbitrageur said it might not be too late for
another bidder to get in the game. He speculated that someone
in the same home improvement business might be able to offer a
deal for stock that would top both the buyout proposal and
Bilzerian's plan.

analysts said.
    "The offer is inadequate," said Douglas Augenthaler, an
analyst with E.F. Hutton, noting that it does not represent the
needed premium over the company's fundamental value based on
earnings estimates.
    USPCI, which has 8.7 mln shares outstanding, was trading at
48-1/8, down 3/8.
    USPCI vice president of finance Larry Shelton said he could
not comment on the adequacy of the offer or on when the board
would meet to consider it.
    Augenthaler said that while USPCI was trading at only 34
dlrs a share at the time of the takeover bid, its announcement
that same day of higher earnings expectations changed its
value. USPCI said its second quarter earnings would exceed
analysts expectations of 24 to 30 cts a share.
    At that price, USPCI could maintain a stock price in the
low 40s, Augenthaler said.
    Hutton revised its 1987 earnings estimate for the waste
management concern to 1.40 dlrs a share from 1.20 dlrs on the
announcment, he said. It lifted its 1988 projection to 1.90
dlrs a share from 1.70 dlrs.
    In addition, analysts said the hazardous waste management
business holds significant growth potential. The industry has
grown from 16 to 35 pct over the last five years, based on
earnings per share, said Jeffrey Klein, an analyst with Kidder
Peabody and Co. The industry is expected to continue growing at
15 to 35 pct over the next five years, he said.
    Augenthaler said the 43-dlr-a-share offer, or 375 mln dlrs
total, would be a bargain for Union Pacific. The transportation
and energy company would both gain entry into a profitable
business and win cost-control benefits, he said.
    "Union Pacific has what are rumored to be some fairly
signficant environmmental problems of its own," he said.

distributor of electronics products offered 240 mln dlrs
for Crazy Eddie Inc <crzy>, the leading New York City
electronics retailer, or one dlr per share more than its
founder has bid.
    The 8-dlr-a-share offer by Entertainment Marketing Inc <em>
for Crazy Eddie comes less than two weeks after founder Eddie
Antar and a firm controlled by the Belzbergs of Canada
announced a bid to take the 32-store Crazy Eddie chain private.
    Analysts said Entertainment Marketing, whose revenues and
profits quadrupled in 1986, may be looking to break into the
highly competitive New York City retail market for consumer
electronics, the nation's biggest, at a time the fortunes of
electronics retailers have sagged.
    The analysts questioned whether Houston-based Entertainment
Marketing, founded by a former electronics retailer but whose
present buinesses are primarily as wholesale distributors, had
the management expertise for retailing or was merely trying to
drive up the price of the Crazy Eddie shares it already owns.
    "I have mixed feelings," said analyst Dennis Telzrow of
Eppler, Geurin and Turner, a Dallas brokerage. "On the one hand
it's probably a cheap price. On the other hand, does
Entertainment Marketing have the management talent to run it
and will the Crazy Eddie people leave?"
    "It's a risky strategy for Entertainment Marketing," said
analyst Eliot Laurence of Wessels Arnold and Henderson, a
Minneapolis brokerage. "Electronics retailing is very management
concentrated; they'd want to keep Crazy Eddie's management in
place."
    Laurence said that, since Entertainment Marketing already
owns 4.3 percent of Crazy Eddie's 31.3 million shares, it may
be trying to get the Antar-Belzberg group to increase its
7-dlr-a-share offer.
    Shares of Crazy Eddie, which have jumped from the high
4-dlr range to above 7 dlrs since the Antar-Belzberg bid was
announced May 20, rose another 50 cents Monday to 8.375 a share
in over-the- counter trading. 
    Antar, the reclusive founder of the chain in the New York
City, Philadelphia and Connecticut areas, said last month that
his group controlled 14 percent of Crazy Eddie's shares.
    A Crazy Eddie spokesman said the company's board has taken
no decision on the Antar-Belzberg offer, worth some 187 mln dlrs
since they own more shares than Entertainment Marketing. He
would not comment on the new offer.
    Entertainment Marketing sells computer products such as
disk drives and other, often discounted electronics goods to
retailers, primarily in the southwest, and directly to
consumers by cable television.
    In fiscal 1986, ending last January, its revenues rose to
87.9 mln dlrs from 21.3 mln dlrs the previous year. Net profit
went to 3.2 mln dlrs from 750,000 dlrs in 1985.
    Entertainment Marketing, whose chief executive officer,
Elias Zinn, once ran an electronics retailing business, said in
a statement it had committed 50 mln dlrs toward the purchase
of Crazy Eddie and had retained Dean Witter Reynolds Inc to
assist in financing the balance.
    Analyst Telzerow estimated that the company would have to
borrow about 100 mln dlrs to complete the proposed buyout since
Crazy Eddie has cash and other assets worth about the same
amount.
    Shares of Entertainment Marketing were up 12.5 cents Monday
to 9.50.

buy <Computerland Corp> will likely take the leading personal
computer retailer public or sell it to other investors,
industry analysts said.
    "Now's a good time," said Joe Levy of International Data
Corp. "The personal computer industry has bottomed out and is
on the way up again," he said.
    Earlier today, closely held Computerland, the largest PC
retailing chain in the country, said it agreed to be bought by
an investor group led by E.M. Warburg Pincus and Co, New York.
    Neither Computerland, which is 96 pct owned by its founder,
William H. Millard, nor E.M. Warburg, a money management and
venture capital firm, would disclose the value of the
transaction.
    Analysts estimated that Computerland, whose 800 stores
generated 1.4 billion dlrs in sales last year, would fetch  150
mln dlrs to 250 mln dlrs. Computerland franchise owners pay
royalties averaging 5.9 pct to the parent company.
    Officials for E.M. Warburg referred all questions to
Computerland. Computerland officials could not immediately be
reached for comment.
    E.M. Warburg currently manages 1.5 billion dlrs in venture
capital funds, and its past investments have included Mattel
Inc <MAT> and the Ingersoll newspaper chain. It is also a money
manager, with 3.5 billion dlrs under management.
   Although the PC retailers are benefitting from the strong
upturn in PC sales, analysts said Computerland must make key
changes if it is to fend off advances from rivals like
Businessland Inc <BUSL.O> and Tandy Corp's <TAN> Radio Shack
stores. "The name of the game now is outbound sales forces,
customer service and customer support," said Levy of
International Data.

    Relations between Computerland and its franchise owners
have mellowed recently after Millard was forced to give up
managment control of the company in 1985.
    Ed Faber, who took over as chairman and chief executive
officer, revamped the company's royalty plan, which help quell
much of the franchisee dissent.

A. Gordon said he plans to issue a decision tomorrow on
Burlington Industries Inc's request for an injunction to stop
Samjens Acquisition Corp's takeover bid for the company.
    Wall Street sources have said the outcome of the case could
be pivotal in determining the winner in the fierce takeover
battle for Burlington, the largest u.s. textile maker.
    Gordon presided over six hours of argument today by lawyers
for Burlington and Samjens, a partnership formed by Dominion
Textile Inc and New York investor Asher Edelman.
    Hearings are scheduled to continue tomorrow. A preliminary
injunction would hold up Samjens 2.47 billion dlr offer until
the case is decided.
    Burlington had previously agreed to a 2.44 billion dlr
buyout from Morgan Stanley Group Inc <MS>, one dlr per share
lower than a sweetened 77 dlr per share bid made by Samjens
last week. Burlington has not responded to the new Samjens
offer.
    Burlington has alleged in its lawsuit that Edelman and
Dominion used illegally obtained confidential information about
the company in making their takeover attempt.
 
    That information, Burlington said, was provided by James
Ammeen, a former Burlington executive, through PaineWebber
Group Inc <PWJ>. Ammeen, who had worked for Burlington for 23
years, had as many as 12 divisions with 50 pct of Burlington's
sales reporting to him. When he left Burlington in November,
1985, Burlington said he signed a contract promising never to
divulge inside information about the company.
    Burlington lawyers said shortly after he left he began
working with a PaineWebber employee on a hostile plan to
"takeover the company, dismember the company and displace its
management," Burlington lawyer Hubert Humphrey said.
    Samjens lawyers acknowledged it received information from
PaineWebber, but argued the information was public information
and could be obtained either from texitle industry analysts or
Burlington's public financial statements.
    Burlington lawyers said PaineWebber and Ammeen met with
Edelman and Dominion in November and continued to meet with
them until a couple of days before Edelman and Dominion went
public April 24 with their intention to take over the company.
Burlington lawyers claim Dominion's board decided to attempt a
takeover of Burlington after Ammeen met with the board in
February.
    Burlington lawyers said Edelman and Dominion held
discussions with PaineWebber and Ammeen about acting as
financial advisers to Samjens. But they allege talks broke off
because Painewebber and Ammeen could not satisfy Edelman and
dominion with a written statement that they did not provide
inside information.
    Lawyers for Samjens contended that Painewebber and Ammeen
withdrew as potential advisers because Burlington chairman
Frank Greenberg had called a PaineWebber executive and
threatened legal action if PaineWebber got involved in an
effort to takeover Burlilgnton.
    "The ultimate question is not the price per share or the
profit, but rather the permissable standards of conduct for
those who would takeover an American company," said burlington
lawyer Humphrey.
    Burlington lawyers also contended that Burlington, as the
largest manufacturer of denim in the United States, would be in
violation of anti-trust laws if it acquired Dominion, Canada's
largest textile maker. Dominion has denim manufacturing plants
in Georgia, which would reduce competition in the denim market,
the lawyers said.
    Samjens' lawyers discounted the concern. They said the
market for denim is more fragmented than Burlington contends
and that Burlington has the ability to switch between light
weight and heavy weight denim production as demand and price
dictate.
    Samjens lawyers also pointed to a lawsuit filed by
Burlington in Canada, in which it said it was considering a bid
for Dominion. "Surely, what would have been sauce for the goose
would have been sauce for the gander," said Sidney Rosdeitcher,
a Samjens lawyer.

the company if they do not get more information about how their

recapitalization plan.
    The holders, none of whom was willing to be identified,
said although Harcourt has urged that they convert their shares
to common stock by the June eight record date for a special
dividend, they were unable to determine if it might be better
for them to continue holding the debentures.
   
    "There are rumors that various houses will bring litigation
if we don't get answers," said a Wall Street source. Officials
of Harcourt declined to comment, citing a suit brought by
British publisher Robert Maxwell whose has been trying to
acquire Harcourt.
    Executives of First Boston Inc, Harcourt's financial
adviser, did not return a telephone call seeking comment.
    When it announced its recapitalization May 26 Harcourt
advised holders of the 6-3/8 pct convertible subordinated
debentures due 2011 to convert into common by the June eight

    Harcourt's special dividend pays 40 dlrs per share in cash
plus a security worth 10 dlrs. Holders would also retain stock
in the recapitalized firm.
    The debentures had been convertible at 34 dlrs per share.
Harcourt's May 26 announcement said the conversion price would
be adjusted according to the indenture covering the securities.
Arbitrageurs said the conversion formula yielded a "negative

offer 4.15 dlrs a share cash for all the issued capital of
Monier Ltd <MNRA.S>, currently the subject of a 3.80 dlrs a
share bid by CSR Ltd <CSRA.S>.
    Alternatively, ETL will offer three shares plus 82 cents
cash for each Monier share, it said in a statement.
    As previously reported, ETL moved into the market for
Monier shares last week, taking its stake to 13.7 pct by
Friday.
    It now holds 14.99 pct, the maximum allowed without Foreign
Investment Review Board (FIRB) approval. ETL is classified as
foreign because of its New Zealand base.
    The ETL cash offer values Monier's issued capital of 156.28
mln shares at 649 mln dlrs, against 593 mln for the CSR bid.
    Based on the current price of ETL shares of 1.05 dlrs, the
alternative is worth 3.97 dlrs per share, but ETL said the
value placed on its shares for the offer aproximates to the
diluted asset backing of ETL as at March 31.
    ETL said the offer will have no minimum acceptance
conditions and will be subject to Australian foreign investment
and U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino anti-trust clearances.
    ETL chairman Allan Hawkins said in the statement that the
shareholding in Monier was a long term investment.
    ETL and its <Feltex International Ltd> associate have
targetted the building products sector as an area of expansion
and Monier fits well with this aim, he added.
    Monier chairman Bill Locke said in a separate statement
that the independent directors of Monier intend to recommend
acceptance of the ETL bid in the absence of a higher bid.
    He also said Monier will not now proceed with the
one-for-two bonus issue announced with its interim results on
March 19 in view of the proposed takeover bids.
    As previously reported, the CSR offer involves a complex
put and call option deal with Monier's major shareholder,
Redland Plc <RDLD.L>, which gives Redland the choice of
accepting the CSR offer for its 49.8 pct stake or moving to
50.1 pct within six months of the bid closing.
    CSR officials have made it clear that they see Redland
taking the second option, resulting in the two companies
running Monier as a joint venture.
    CSR officials have also said they had no intention of
raising the company's bid for Monier after ETL's intervention

industrial gases group Aga AB <AGA.ST>, ending a lengthy battle
between rival bidders from France, Spain and West Germany,
Duffour et Igon Chairman Jean Igon said.
    The board agreed late last night to back the Aga bid and
advise its shareholders to accept the Swedish group's latest
offer of 4,410 francs per share, he told Reuters.
    The other main bidders were Union Carbide Corp's <UK.>
French subsidiary <Union Carbide France> and West Germany's

    Aga topped rival bids for the gases distribution group in
May by raising its offer to 4,410 francs from 4,000 francs.
    This was accepted by Spain's <Carburos Metalicos SA> which
sold Aga six pct of Duffour et Igon's stock and the right of
first refusal on the remaining nine pct of stock it holds. It
also won over the French Midi-Pyrenees development authority

    Under Aga's offer, shareholders can either accept a cash
bid or exchange one share in Duffour et Igon for one bond of a
nominal value of 4,410 francs with a 10 pct coupon issue by Aga
France SA. The bond issue is guaranteed by the parent Aga AB.
    The takeover battle for the Toulouse-based company, which
controls eight pct of the French industrial gas distribution
market, began on April 2 with an offer of 2,100 francs per
share from Union Carbide France <UK>.
    Aga's offer, which puts a price of 587 mln francs on the

    Duffour et Igon shares were quoted yesterday at 4,410

its planned bid for building materials group Monier Ltd
<MNRA.S> despite the counter-bid from <Equiticorp Tasman Ltd>
(ETL), CSR executive director Gene Herbert told Reuters.
    ETL said today it would offer 4.15 dlrs each for Monier's
issued capital of 156.28 mln shares, plus a share alternative.
This compares with a 3.80 dlr cash element in CSR's proposed
bid.
    The proposed offer by ETL, controlled by New Zealand
entrepreneur Allan Hawkins, came after it built up a 14.99 pct
stake in Monier in a 95 mln dlr share raid in recent days.

    Herbert said Britain's Redland Plc <RDLD.L>, which holds
just under 50 pct of Monier, still supported the CSR bid and
had told CSR it is not a seller.
    He said Redland wanted to maintain and build on its
operations in Australia and the U.S., Where Monier has built up
a strong presence, notably in roofing tile manufacture.
    The CSR offer contains a put and call option agreement with
Redland. This enables Redland to accept the CSR bid within six
months of its close or to lift its stake to 50.1 pct in the
same period and to run Monier as a joint venture with CSR.
    CSR has said that Redland will take up the second option.

    ETL has declined to say why it intervened in Monier, beyond
describing it as a long term investment.
    ETL would bring no synergies to Monier, unlike CSR which is
a leader in building materials, Herbert said.
    "We fit better with Monier," he said.
    CSR has said that it will concentrate development on its
core businesses of sugar and building materials after its moves
into energy several years ago.
    Asked what he thought ETL's bid sought to achieve, Herbert
said: "I'm puzzled as to what Hawkins' strategy is. One has to
wonder if Monier is the main target."

    Herbert said CSR had no plans to raise its bid, and said a
higher price would be difficult to justify on fundamentals.
    Monier was trading at 2.80 dlrs when CSR launched its
original bid of 3.50, or 16.8 times earnings, in late April.
    The shares closed at 3.90 dlrs today, down 25 cents on
yesterday, after ETL withdrew on reaching the top foreign
shareholding level permitted without Foreign Investment Review
Board (FIRB) approval. Its bid is subject to FIRB approval.
    Herbert also said that institutions, which are more likely
to accept a share alternative than cash, would have to judge
the respective values of ETL and CSR shares.

    ETL is the third group to become involved in a possible
acquisition of Monier this year. Redland held discussions on a
possible takeover before the CSR bid emerged but the
negotiations foundered on the price.
    Share analysts said that for this reason, they did not
think ETL's intervention would flush out a full Redland bid
although Monier's ultimate fate rests in its hands.
    "Redland is still in the driving seat," said Tim Cohen of
<Ord Minnett Ltd>, adding that Redland would be happier having
CSR as a partner in running Monier than ETL.
    Monier's independent directors have recommended ETL's bid.

A. Gordon said he will decide "in the next few days" whether to
grant Burlington Industries Inc's request to stop a takeover by
Samjens Acquisition Corp.
    "I do not know how I come down on this preliminary
injunction," Gordon said after listening to arguments by
attorneys for 1-1/2 days.
    "It's been a long time since I was deluged with as much
information as I have been. I have to consider what's been
presented and issue an opinion on this. Both sides cannot be
winners," he said.
    Burlington requested the injunction to stop a takeover
effort by Samjens, claiming the partnership used illegally
obtained confidential information about the company to make its
offer. It also alleges there would be anti-trust violations if
Samjens, formed by Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of
Canada, were to succeed.
    Samjens last week topped a 76 dlr per share offer for
Burlington from Morgan Stanley Group <MS> by one dlr per share.
Morgan Stanley made its 2.44 billion dlr bid after Samjens bid
72 dlrs per share for Burlington.
    Burlington lawyers told the court if the injunction is not
granted Samjens would win control of Burlington. A Samjens
lawyer argued that if the judge granted the injunction it would
"kill the offer"
    Jay Greenfield, an attorney for Samjens, said the
partnership would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction
were granted. "There's only one Burlington," he said. "If we
cannot get that then no amount of money can compensate us."
    Greenfield also said Samjens could sell its holdings in
Burlington for 95 mln dlrs. "We don't want that. We're not in
this for the money," he said.
    Irving Nathan, a Burlington lawyer, reiterated that
information provided by James Ammeen, a former Burlington
executive, was crucial to Dominion's decision to attempt o
takeover of Burlington.
    "Dominion relied on the information provided by the insider
Jim Ammeen," Nathan said.
    An attorney for Ammeen, who is named as a defendant, asked
the court to dismiss the lawsuit against his client. The judge
said he would not rule on the request today.

sold Westin hotels in San Francisco and Chicago. Allegis
reported a pretax gain of 80.6 mln dlrs as a result of that
partnership.
   
    An Allegis spokesman said the offerings have been in
planning stages for a long time and are unrelated to recent
corporate developments such as the firm's recapitalization plan
and a threatened takeover by an investor group lead by Coniston
Partners and the pilots of its United Airlines unit.
    The spokesman said the company has not yet identified which
of its Canadian hotels will be offered for sale.
    Allegis has 100 pct ownership in Westin hotels in
Vancouver, Calgary, Ottawa and Toronto, and 100 pct interest in
Hilton International hotels in Toronto and Montreal. It owns 60
pct of the Westin in Edmonton.
    Richard Ferris, chairman of Allegis, said in a statement
the hotel limited partnerships allow the company to convert
unrecognized asset appreciation into cash.
    As with the proceeds from the earlier limited partnership,
the money will be used for general corporate needs, the
spokesman said.
    Merrill Lynch Capital Markets and Wood Gundy will be lead
underwriters for to the public offering. The limited
partnership will be offered outside the U.S, Allegis said.

considering the possibility of recapitalizing, restructuring,
or seeking a buyer for the company following its rejection of
an unsolicitied 32 dlr a share bid from Ciba-Geigy Corp.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
the San Jose, Calif., gas lasers and accessories company also
said its board Sunday agreed to a plan that gives 52 top
executives bonuses ranging from 20 to 50 pct of their base
salary if they stay with the company through August 29.
    In rejecting the takeover proposal by the U.S. subsidiary
of Swiss-based Ciba-Geigy AG, the company said it was unfair.
    The Spectra-Physics board voted unanimously, with two
Ciba-Geigy representatives not participating, to reject the
Swiss-based chemical and pharmaceutical company's takeover bid,
citing an opinion from its financial advsior, Morgan Stanley
and Co Inc, that it is "inadequate and unfair from a financial
point of view to the holders of shares," the company said.
    The board also authorized a special committee and Morgan
Stanley to "vigorously investigate, pursue and authorize any
alternatives which would maximize the value of shareholders'
investment in the company," the company said.
    Among the alternatives the special committee will consider
are a sale of the company to a third party for more than 32
dlrs a share, a recapitalization or restructuring, including
self tender offers and/or asset dispositions through the use of
dividends, Spectra-Physics said.
    The "retention plan" for the 52 top officers will pay an
average bonus percentage of 28 pct of salary, it said.
    Spectra-Physics said its board approved the plan "in order
to encourage key operating personnel to remain with the company
during the period of turmoil and uncertainty engendered by the
(Ciba-Geigy) offer."
    Under the plan, the executives would be entitled to their
cash bonuses if they stay with the company through August 29,
but could receive them earlier if they are fired for reasons
other than gross and willful misconduct, or if they leave the
company because their salaries have been sharply cut.
    Spectra-Physics also said it filed suit against Ciba-Geigy
yesterday in U.S. District Court in Wilmington, Del., charging
it with making a takeover bid that was false and misleading in
violation of securities law and with violating the intent of
July 9, 1985 standstill agreement.
    Spectra-Physics said Ciba-Geigy indicated at the time of
the standstill agreement that it would not make an unsolicited
takeover proposal for the company and that the intent of the
agreement was that Ciba-Geigy would not acquire more than 20
pct of the company unless there was another takeover threat.
    Ciba-Geigy was 18.8 pct of Spectra-Physics and Reliance
Group Holdings <REL>, which is controlled by New York investor
Saul Steinberg, controls 12.8 pct.
    Spectra-Physics said the agreement prevents Ciba-Geigy from
raising its stake beyond 20 pct through Jan 1, 1992, unless
another person get more than 10 pct of its voting power.

cash for its previously reported acquisition of privately owned
Unimedia Inc, chairman Conrad Black told reporters after the
annual meeting, confirming a published report.
    Commenting on press reports about the 50 mln dlr price tag,
Black said, "That would not be wildly inaccurate," although he
declined to disclose the actual cost.
    Montreal-based Unimedia is Quebec's third largest newspaper
group, with three French language daily newspapers in Quebec
City, Ottawa and Chicoutimi, Quebec and four printing plants in
Ontario and Quebec.
    Black added that Hollinger would also continue seeking
acquisitions of daily newspapers with circulation under 25,000
readers. He said Hollinger was currently talking to about 10
such newspapers in the U.S. where the company currently owns 23
dailies.
    "There is really no end to the ones that are available," he
told reporters, although he added that most remaining
acquisition opportunities are in the U.S.
    He said that Hollinger's 58 pct-owned Daily Telegraph PLC,
of London, should become profitable in this year's fourth
quarter.
   
    For full-year 1987, the Daily Telegraph could break even or
better, said Black, citing major reductions in labor costs and
improved technology at the Telegraph, Britain's largest
circulation quality daily. The Telegraph lost 13.2 mln Canadian
dlrs last year.
    Daily Telegraph chief executive Andrew Knight told
reporters after the meeting that the Telegraph's daily
circulation had risen by 25,000 since September to about
1,150,000 on weekdays, despite added competition from the new
Independent daily newspaper.
   
    Knight said The Independent was not affecting the
Telegraph's growth, but was making inroads into the circulation
of other London quality dailies such as The Times and The
Guardian.
    Hollinger chairman Black predicted Hollinger would post
1987 net income of about 55 mln dlrs, or one dlr a share,
including extraordinary gains from previous sales of
discontinued operations. Hollinger lost 87 mln dlrs or 6.54
dlrs a share last year on fewer average shares and after an
extraordinary loss of 52 mln dlrs.
   
    Black told shareholders that first quarter operating
earnings on continuing operations amounted to 499,000 dlrs
against a year-ago loss of 165,000 dlrs.
    Revenues on continuing operations rose to 102.1 mln dlrs
from 1.5 mln dlrs last year, which did not include Daily
Telegraph revenues, he added. Consolidated first quarter
figures were not disclosed.
    He said the Daily Telegraph's first quarter operating loss

conference that the merged firm would be able to offer products
for all types of drilling operations.
    He said there were already signs that a slow recovery from
recession was under way in the oil and gas industries.
    "Stability in oil prices should lead to renewed investment"
Paues said.
    DBS, which Paues said began operations today, brings
together Sandvik's wholly-owned U.S. Subsidiary Strata Bit Corp
of Houston and Diamant Boart's petroleum activities in Europe,
North America, the Middle and Far East and Africa.
    Paues said the merger was a direct result of the sharp fall
in oil prices 18 months ago which led oil firms to cut back
exploration activities. Officials said the complementary
character of the two firms' operations was a further reason.

    The defendants in the suit are WPP Group and its units and
Peters, who until January 29 was a director of J. Walter
Thompson Co, JWT Group's main subsidiary and its president and

spin-off of a 20 pct interest in its chemical operations, could
gain about 500 mln dlrs from the deal, industry analysts
estimated.
    Yesterday ARCO's stock jumped as much as five points on
rumors it was spinning off the chemical operations. Based on
about 183 mln outstanding shares, the market in its frenzy was
valuing the spin-off at about 900 mln dlrs, analysts said.
    Atlantic Richfield, aware of the rumors, issued a statement
around mid-day that it was considering a sale of only 20 pct of
the unit, leading investors to take profits.
    After the announcement, the company's stock retreated,
closing at 93-7/8, up 1-3/8. Today it was off 1/4.
    "It was a smaller deal than expected and somewhat
disappointing," said analyst George Baker at Smith Barney. He
said rumors of the spin-off had been around "for a couple of
days."
    Baker said the unit was very profitable but it wasn't
getting the type of exposure Atlantic Richfield sought, and its
value was not reflected in the company's stock price.
    Industry analyst Richard Pzena of Sanford C. Bernstein said
the unit had operating earnings of 132 mln dlrs last year and
he expected it to earn about 175 mln dlrs this year.
    Based on a multiple of 17 times earnings--which Pzena says
chemical companies now sell for--the entire unit is worth about
three billion dlrs, putting the 20 pct interest at around 500
to 600 mln dlrs.
    Pzena said he thought the company was selling the stake
because chemical margins had peaked, and he speculated the
company would use the proceeds to pay down debt.
    But he added the possibility remained the deal would fall
through. Yesterday, ARCO said the proposal had not yet been
presented to its board.
    The chemical unit last year had revenues of 1.9 billion
dlrs.

Inc <REV>, may be trying to ignite a bidding war for Gillette
Co that could draw some big international players and in the
process make a lot of money for himself, Wall Street analysts
said.
    Several hours before a regularly scheduled board of
directors meeting, Gillette disclosed that Perelman requested
consent of its board for an offer of at least 40.50 dlrs per
share. Perelman needed the consent because he agreed in
November not to buy stock for 10 years without permission.
    "I think Ronald Perelman is less interested in Gillette and
more interested in putting Gillette into play because he stands
to make a ton of money," said Andrew Shore, analyst at Shearson
Lehman Brothers Inc. "In play" is a term used on Wall Street to
describe what happens when a company becomes an unwiling
takeover target.
    Shore noted that according to the 1986 agreement Revlon
gets paid if there is any acquisition of Gillette through
November of this year at a price higher than 29.75 dlrs per
share. Gillette rose three to 40 today, following a gain of
three yesterday.
    The agreement would be calculated on the basis of
Perelman's previous holding of 18.4 mln shares, adjusted for a
split. For example, a deal between Gillette and some other
company at 44 dlrs per share would make Revlon richer by 262
mln dlrs under the formula. Neither Perelman nor his spokesmen
returned telephone calls seeking comment.
    "Revlon stands to make a substantial amount of money if
someone else takes over Gillette," said Analyst Deepak Raj of
Merrill Lynch and Co. "I'm not saying that is going to happen
but Gillette is an undervalued stock with a breakup value of 45
dlrs per share."
    Shore of Shearson Lehman said there are a couple of reasons
why Perelman may not be really interested in acquiring
Gillette. He said Perelman, in the process of taking Revlon
private after acquiring control of the cosmetics company two
years ago, probably wants to concentrate on improving Revlon's
operations. "He's trying to overhaul and improve the image of
the dearptment store business." Another reason is that Revlon
has recently made two other acquisitions.
    Under those circumstances, Shore would not be surprised if
some company such as Unilever plc <UN.AS> or Procter and Gamble
Co <PG> decided to take a look at Gillette.
    Shore mentioned half a dozen other potential buyers for
Gillette including Sir James Goldsmith, Hanson Trust plc <HAN>,
RJR Nabisco Inc <RJR>, American Brands Inc <AMB> and Ralston
Purina Co <RAL>.
    "Perelman is trying to put the company in play," said a
Wall Street arbitrageur. "He gets to share in the upside if the
company is sold." Another arbitrageur said he expects Gillette
to resist Perelman's overture. "I can't see the board
consenting, what has changed between November and now," he
said.
   
    Another arbitrageur said he was not sure what was going on.
"Perelman never does anything without a fair amount of
calculation," he said. But he added, "The Gillette board has to
be careful. They just can't say no or they'll be sued by
shareholders." Gillette's board was still meeting at 1700 EDT,
three and one-half hours after the scheduled starting time.
    According to a copy of Perelman's letter released by
Gillette, he would be prepared to sign a defnitive merger
agreement without any financing condition. He said Citibank
N.A. is his lead lender and First Boston Inc is his financial
adviser.

executive of Cetus Corp <CTUS.O>, told Reuters that Squibb Corp
is not interested in buying Cetus.
    Earlier the companies said Squibb would buy from Cetus a
five pct equity postion in Cetus for about 40 mln dlrs.
    "This is not an attempt by Squibb to become a major
majority holder in Cetus," Fildes told Reuters in an interview.
"Squibb has not approached us with any indication that they
want to acquire us and we wouldn't be interested in that kind
of arrangement," said Fildes.
    Squibb could not be reached to comment on the late comments
by Fildes.
    Squibb is Cetus' first pharmaceutical partner and the only
one to own an equity position in Cetus. Eastman Kodak Co <EK>
and W.R. Grace <WR> both have joint ventures with Cetus, but
neither owns an equity position in the company, said Fildes.
    Cetus has a venture with Kodak to develp diagnostic
products and with Grace to develop agricultural products.
    Earlier, Squibb and Cetus announced in a joint statement 
an agreement in principle to form a joint venture to develop
new biotechnology products in several fields.
   
    As part of the deal Squibb will license several of Cetus'
anticancer agents, including interleukin-2, in development.
Squibb will sell the drugs only in Japan and other markets but
not in North American and Western Europe.
    "We wouldn't have done this deal had it not been understood
that Cetus wants to build its own fully integrated business in
North America and Europe," said Fildes.
    He said Squibb was the good partner because Squibb has a
major joint venture in Japan and has sales capabilities of its

    Fildes said Cetus has shunned licensing arrangements with
pharmaceutical companies because it wanted to build its own
business. Many large corporations have invested in small
biotech firms.
    But Squibb's investment in Cetus is the first it has made
in biotechnology. Fildes said that was attractive to Cetus
because it wanted a partner that didn't have a relationship
with a large number of other biotechnology companies."
   
    Fildes said his strategy was to have partners in non drug
areas like diagnostics and agriculture, but to "keep the
biggest developments in anticancer drugs to ourselves."
    Fildes said the partnership with Squibb would be used to
broaden the company's reach in such big money making areas
as the cardiovascular, anti-infective and the anti-inflammatory
markets.
    Squibb is also investming 75 mln dlrs in Cetus' research
over the next five years.
   
    "Squibb is putting up over 75 mln dlrs in research and
development to make it happen, while the equity position part
of the package is simply to demonstrate the seriousness of this
partnership," said Fildes.

take control of the U.S. Shaw's Supermarkets Inc through a
combination of share purchases and a tender offer at 30 dlrs a
share.
    Sainsbury bought about 21 pct of the stock in 1983. It said
its U.S. Subsidiary, Chene Investments Inc, bought 2.55 mln
common shares from the controlling Davis family yesterday at 30
dlrs a share for 76.5 mln dlrs, lifting its stake to 49.4 pct.
    A tender offer for the outstanding shares will be launched,
also at 30 dlrs a share for a maximum further cost of 184.4
mln.
    The Shaw's Board and the Davis family has agreed to accept
the offer, thus assuring Sainsbury's a total holding of 74.0
pct.
    The company had allotted 20.18 mln new ordinary shares to
<Warburg Securities Ltd> which it said would be sufficient to
finance about 188 mln dlrs of the maximum 261 mln dlrs payable.
    Shaw's operates a chain of 49 supermarkets in
Massachusetts, Maine and New Hampshire which in 1986 produced
sales of 1.1 billiob dlrs and pretax profit of 31.1 mln. At the
end of 1986 it had net assets of 88 mln dlrs.
    Last September, Sainsbury's increased its stake in Shaw's
to 28.5 pct. In the year to March 21, it reported a rise in
pretax profit to 246.9 mln stg from 192.7 mln on sales that
increased to 4.04 billion from 3.58 billion.
    Sainsbury shares had fallen five pence before the
announcement to 590p from last night's close but were unmoved

were not available for comment on market rumors that it is
interested in acquiring Reed International plc <REED.L>.
    Officials of First Boston Inc, Harcourt's financial
adviser, declined comment.
    A Wall Street arbitrageur, who owns Harcourt shares, said
the rumors did not make much sense because Harcourt has
announced a recapitalization plan to ward off a takeover
attempt by British publisher Robert Maxwell."It's completely
inconsistent with the recapitalization, the only way is if they
drop the recapitalization," he said.
    Calls to Harcourt seeking comment were not returned.
    Harcourt's recapitalization will come under scrutiny of a
U.S. Court in Orlando, Fla. Monday. The company has sought a
declaratory judgment on convertibility of debentures due 2011
in light of the recapitalization.
    Harcourt said in a statement this week that Salomon
Brothers Inc <SB> and Mutual Shares Corp have intervened in the
case, claiming ownership of more than 30 mln dlrs face amount
of the debenture. In addition, British Printing and
Communications Corp, headed by Maxwell, owns 9.5 mln dlrs face
amount, Harcourt said.
    Salomon said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission today that it has 21,978 of the debentures. If the
court decides they should be converted at par value of one dlr,
they could be converted into 22.0 mln shares.
    Harcourt is asking the court to rule the company is not
required to issue common to debenture holders who did not
convert prior to June eight.
    An increase in Reed shares in London today was attributed
by brokers to rumors of Harcourt's interest and also to rumors

letter to employees, said it told an "aggressive buyer" of the
company's stock that it does not want to be acquired.
    A Dayton Hudson spokeswoman would not identify the buyer,
but Wall Street sources said Dart Group Corp <DARTA.O> was the
company interested in buying Dayton Hudson stock.
    The Wall Street sources said the Dart Group is expected
soon to file a statement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on its accumulation of Dayton Hudson stock.
    According to the letter to company employess, Dayton Hudson
management has moved in two directions to fend off a takeover.
According to the letter, chairman Kenneth Macke expressed to
the group buying its stock the company's desire to remain
independent.
    Dayton Hudson Thursday night met with Minnesota governor
Rudy Perpich, appealing for legislative help.
    A spokesman for Governor Perpich earlier said the governor
is expected later today to recommend stiffening the state's
anti-takeover law to help the Minneopolis retailer defend
itself.
    Minnesota House speaker designate said the legislators
would probably look at language similar to that contained in
Indiana and New York law. He said any amendment proposed would
probably be designed to thwart a company from dismantling a
company for its own profit.
   "Obviously Dayton-Hudson people feel whatever statutes we
have would not protect them enough," Vanasek said.

policeman for the nation's securities markets will inherit an
agency challenged by an insider trading scandal, wild stock
price gyrations and a host of uncertainties stemming from the
globalization of financial markets.
    David Ruder, a 58-year-old Republican law professor at
Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., was named Thursday
to be the 23rd chairman of the five-member U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission.
    If confirmed by the Senate, as expected, he will succeed
John Shad, who left the agency earlier this week after a record
six years as chairman to become ambassador to the Netherlands.
    The SEC has been in the limelight for the past year as its
investigators have probed into the most colossal insider
trading scandal ever uncovered on Wall Street.
    The investigation, which is still active, mushroomed in
recent months as a growing number of well known traders and
prominent investment banking firms have been charged with
wrongdoing.
    The pace of the probe picked up markedly in November after
Ivan Boesky, one of Wall Street's most successful stock
speculators, agreed to cooperate with government investigators
and to pay a record 100 mln dlrs in penalties and illegal
profits after being charged with insider trading.
    But the agency is also wrestling with a vexing new
phenomenon of huge and rapid swings in stock prices, spurred by
computer-driven trading strategies that span markets in 
securities, options and futures. The price gyrations have
combined with rising trading volumes to bring unprecedented
volatility to some U.S. securities markets.
    At the same time, the SEC is being pressed by some
lawmakers to put a stop to abusive tactics in corporate
takeover contests as an unrelenting wave of such takeovers
steadily reshapes the U.S. corporate landscape.
    And the agency is being pushed by U.S. and foreign
exchanges intent on expansion to lay the regulatory groundwork
for an international securities marketplace in which trading
occurs across borders throughout the world, around the clock.
    Such worldwide trading networks offer vast new investment
opportunities but could strain the SEC's ability to enforce
U.S. securities laws and guard investors from fraud.
    Under the leadership of Shad, the SEC eased financial
disclosure requirements for publicly traded companies,
eliminated many minor investor protection rules, attempted to
spur competition among exchanges and streamlined the agency's
review of hostile corporate takeovers.
    Shad, who had been vice chairman of the E. F. Hutton
investment banking firm, brought a Wall Street perspective to
the agency upon being named chairman in 1981.
    In line with the views of other top administration
officials, he favored marketplace determination of takeover
battles over new federal regulations.
    The SEC under Shad also stressed prosecution of insider
trading violations over the corporate wrongdoing cases that
topped the agency's enforcement agenda during the
administration of President Jimmy Carter, a Democrat.
    Securities lawyers and industry officials acquainted with
Ruder say the new chairman-designate is unlikely to
significantly alter the commission's current priorities.
    The SEC currently has about 2,000 employees, most of them
lawyers, and an annual budget of about 115 mln dlrs though that
figure likely will be significantly higher next year as the
agency moves to beef up its enforcement staff.
    The agency is one of the few in the government that
actually has taken in more money than it has spent in the past
few years because of fees it charges public companies,
investment banks and other securities firms it regulates.
    The SEC is structured as an independent regulatory agency,
meaning that its five commissioners are appointed by the
president to fixed five-year terms and protected from firing
for policy differences alone.
    By law, no more than three commissioners may be of the same
political party, and the agency prepares its own budget request
each year instead of leaving this to the White House.
    Established by Congress in 1934, the SEC traces its origins
to the great stock market crash of 1929, which was attributed
in large part to widespread trading on credit and attempted
market manipulations by large investment firms.
    The agency requires public companies and investment
vehicles such as mutual funds to issue periodic reports on
their financial condition and to disclose changes in their
condition any time they issue new securities.
    It requires brokers, dealers and investment banks to
register with it and comply with investor protection rules, and
it polices exchanges and regulates trading practices.
    Its first chairman was Joseph Kennedy, an industrial
magnate who was also the father of John Kennedy, later to
become the nation's 35th president.
    Other former chairmen include William Douglas, who served
from 1937 until his appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court in
1939, and William Casey, who served during President Nixon's
first term and was Reagan's director of the Central
Intelligence Agency until his death earlier this year.

approved Citicorp's application to purchase through its
subsidiary, Citicorp Savings of Oakland, Calif., some assets
and assume some liabilities of Sears Savings Bank of Glendale,
Calif.
    Citicorp Savings proposed to assume two billion dlrs in
deposits and other liabilities and to purchase 1.9 billion dlrs
in assets of 50 branch offices of Sears Savings.
    The proposal involved less than one third of the assets and
liabilities of Sears Savings, owned by Sears, Roebuck and Co
<S>.
    The Fed said that it generally has determined there were
potentially adverse effects of allowing affiliations of banks
and savings and loan associations, although it has allowed bank
holding companies to acquire some failing thrifts.
    It said Citicorp's proposal "properly may be viewed as the
permissible acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of S
and L branches rather than the acquisition of an S and L."
    Citicorp Savings, the successor to the failed Fidelity
Savings and Loan Association, has assets of 4.9 billion dlrs
and operates 86 branches in California, mainly in the north.
    Sears Savings has 6.6 billion in assets and 91 branches
predominantly in southern California.
    The application, which was approved unanimously, will not
eliminate Sears Savings as a competitor, the Fed said.

    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,

Cardis common stock, and said it "would likely support" an

Commission charged Allied Stores Corp with failing to promptly
disclose key steps it was taking last September to thwart a
takeover attempt by Campeau Corp.
    In an administrative complaint, the SEC said Allied and its
legal adviser failed to promptly inform shareholders and the
agency that it had begun talks with Youngstown, Ohio, shopping
center developer Edward DeBartolo in response to Campeau's
takeover offer.
    Campeau acquired Allied for an estimated 4.2 billion dlrs
on Jan 1, following a battle with DeBartolo.
    On Sept 25, a day after Allied disclosed that its board had
urged rejection of Campeau's Sept 12 tender offer for 58 dlrs a
share, Allied began negotiating the sale of six shopping
centers to DeBartolo, the SEC said.
    Allied legal advisor and director George Kern, who heads
the merger and acquisitions group at the New York law firm of
Sullivan and Cromwell, decided against amending Allied's SEC
filing to disclose the talks even though they had resulted in
sales price of 405 mln dlrs for the shopping centers, it said.
    Securities law requires takeover target companies to
promptly disclose such things as the sale of major assets.
    The day after Campeau increased its tender offer to 80 pct
of Allied's stock from 55 pct and raised its bid to 66 dlrs a
share from 58 dlrs on Sept 29, Allied and a partnership headed
by DeBartolo began negotiating a takeover deal aimed at
thwarting Campeau, the SEC said.
    Kern again decided against disclosing the talks in an
amended SEC filing, the agency charged.
    Allied's first disclosure of the DeBartolo takeover was
made on Oct 8, even though its board approved the merger on Oct
3 and the merger agreement was executed on Oct 7, the complaint
said.
    DeBartolo and Campeau later engaged in a bitter battle for
control of Allied, with Campeau winning out later in October
when it bought a block of 25.8 mln shares of Allied stock, or
48 pct of the total, in a controversial move made only minutes
after it dropped its hostile tender offer.
    The acquisition of the additional 48 pct, which a federal
judge allowed to be completed, gave Campeau a majority stake in
Allied. Campeau bought the rest at 69 dlrs a share.
    The SEC said it had planned to file a court brief joining
with Allied in charging that Campeau had engaged in an illegal
tender offer.
    But the SEC brief was never filed since the case was
dropped following an agreement between Campeau and DeBartolo.
    In the administrative proceeding against Allied and Kern,
the SEC is asking for an administrative order that they comply
with reporting provisions of securities laws in the future.
    Although Allied is no longer publicly traded since it
became a subsidiary of Campeau, it still files annual and
quarterly reports to the SEC because it has outstanding debt.

in and around San Francisco over the past seven years have had
only a modest effect on the metropolitan area's economy, a
leading business-backed organization said.
    The Bay Area Council, a group of more than 300 business
firms, said that a study of corporate restructuring in a
nine-county area found that San Francisco itself had suffered
some ill effects from corporate shake-ups but that surrounding
communities had not.
    Seventeen of the 32 Fortune 500 companies in the area left
due to corporate restructuring between 1979 and 1986, but
another 21 firms were added to the list.
    Ten of the departing companies were based in San Francisco.
During the period, only six located in the city achieved
Fortune 500 status.
    Ted Hall, a council director and local managing director of
McKinsey and Co. which conducted the survey, said the study
grew out of concern that mergers and acquisitions had seriously
hurt the economic climate of northern California.
    However, Hall said that only about 36,000 jobs had been
lost in the region, while more than 600,000 new jobs were
created during the period.
    At the same time, he said, the region experienced a greater
rise in per capita income and lower unemployment than the rest
of the United States and California.
    Council President George Keller, who also is chairman and
chief executive officer of Chevron Corp., told a news
conference that the region had difficulties in persuading
companies to locate there because of a fragmented local
political system.
    But he said that because of the amenities of living in San
Francisco, he was the envy of many chief executives in other
metropolitan area.
    "It's a great place to run a business," he added, "but it's
a hell of a place to do business with government."
    The study concluded that Chevron, which mergered with Gulf
Oil in 1984, would benefit in the long run from the
restructuring activity.
    Among the corporate headquarters lost during the period
were Crown Zellerbach, Memorex, Southern Pacific, Castle &
Cooke and Rolm.
    Companies that grew enough during the period to make the
Fortune 500 list included Apple Computer, Pacific Telesis,
McKesson, Tandem Computer, U.S. Leasing and Amfac.
    The study by the management consulting firm said that,
partly due to corporate restructuring, the rate of job growth
in San Francisco has slowed since 1980.
    In addition, it said that the loss of corporate leadership
had adversely affected some of the Bay Area's civic and
charitable activities.

Hanover, West Germany, jointy announced they signed an
agreement for Continental to buy Gencorp's General Tire Inc
subsidiary for 650 mln dlrs in cash.
    Under the agreement the companies said Continental will
acquire General Tire, including its related domestic and
foreign operations, and Gencorp will retain liability for the
medical benefits of retired General Tire employees who retired
on or before November 30, 1984.
    The sale is expected to be completed on or before November
one and is subject to meeting certain conditions.
    Continental is Europe's second largest tire producer. Last
year, the company had sales of 2.6 billion dlrs, with 1.9
billion dlrs generated by its tire operations.
    Last year, General Tire had operating profits of 79 mln
dlrs on sales of 1.1 billion dlrs, and Gencorp had operating
profits of 130 mln dlrs on sales of 3.1 billion dlrs.
    GenCorp spokesman Rip Tilden said the company will retain
about 100 mln dlrs in liability for its former General Tire
employees under the agreement.
    Tilden said Gencorp will use the proceeds from the sale to
reduce its 1.5 billion dlr debt.
    In April, GenCorp sucessfully thwarted a takeover by a
partnership formed by AFG Industries Inc <AFG> and Wagner and
Brown with a restructuring program that included the purchase
of up to 54 pct, or 12.5 mln shares, of its common at 130 dlrs
a share for a total of 1.6 billion dlrs
    As part of the restructuring, GenCorp also said it planned
to sell its tire business, the bottling operations of its RKO
General Inc subsidiary, and RKO's remaining broadcast
properties to focus on the company's aerospace and automotive
components businesses.
   
    Tilden said Gencorp expects to realize about 850 mln dlrs
in after tax proceeds by the end of 1987 as a result of sale of
several pieces of the nonbroadcast assets of the company,
including general tire.
    "The price paid for General tire would not cause us to
reevaluate that estimate," said Tilden.
    General Tire employs 10,000 people worldwide and has four
tire manufacturing plants in the U.S. and one in Canada.
    In a statemnet, A. William Reynolds, GenCorp chairman said
the sale of General Tire "represents a critical accomplishment
in our plan to restructure GenCorp."
   
    Reynolds also said GenCorp's previously announced sale of
its other businesses are "proceeding satisfactorily."
    Among the pieces of Gencorp's empire that remain to be sold
are its RKO bottling operations. GenCorp agreed to sell RKO's
KHJ-TV station to Walt Disney Co <DIS> for

has concluded that the merger proposal submitted by Rorer Group
Inc <ROR> merits further consideration.
    At the request of the board, Rorer has agreed to extend
until 1800 EDT July 2 its deadline for response from A.H.
Robins.
    After Rorer announced its second bid for the company last
Thursday, analysts forecast that the Robins family, which holds
control of the company, would vigourously oppose any merger.
    But, the analysts added, that Robins desire to emerge
independent from two years of bankruptcy proceedings may be
thwarted by some Robins' shareholders who perceive a merger as
a more expedient way of dealing with the company's Dalkon
Shield related liabilities.
    After a failed first attempt earlier this year, Rorer's
latest merger plan calls for a share swap worth about 720 mln
dlrs.
    Rorer would also set up two trusts to cover the estimated
1.75 billion dlrs in liabilities to deal with about 320,000
claims by women who suffered maladies from the use of the
Dalkon Shield interuterine device.

into the California market with Citicorp Savings' acquisition
of 50 of Sears Roebuck's <S> Sears Savings Bank branches,
bringing its presences to 143 branches in 101 communities,
CitiCorp Savings said.
    Thrift industry analysts said the move, approved by the
Federal Reserve board today, is a plus for Citicorp and shows
its serious intent to penetrate the California market.
    The acquisition mostly extends Citicorp's reach into
Southern California, where 34 of the 50 branches are located.
Citicorp Savings was predominantly in Northern California.
    "This marks our first major expansion in California,
particularly in the south," said Citicorp Savings President
Edward Valencia, in a statement.
    Thrift industry sources said they do not see a major
near-term impact on the Southern California thrift market, but
do expect Citicorp to be a more aggressive competitor than
Sears was in that market.
    "We do believe they will be a better competitor than
Sears," said James Stutz, Executive Vice President of Home
Federal Savings and Loan Association <HFD>, based in San Diego.
    Banking industry sources said the move is viewed as
groundwork, to establish Citicorp throughout the California
market, well before the 1991 law change that will allow it to
operate as a bank in the state. They said Citicorp is likely to
convert the branches to banks at that time.
    In the near-term, however, analysts said with seven billion
dlrs in assets, Citicorp Savings is still not a major force in
the thrift market, against such large California thrifts as
Home Federal, Great Western Financial Corp <GWF>, H F Ahmanson
and Co <AHM>, Golden West  Financial <GWD> and Great American
First Savings Bank <GTA>.

the government to proceed cautiously on a plan allowing the
nation's two largest intercity bus companies to merge their
operations, a move one of the firms said may derail the deal.
    Justice's opposition to quick federal approval of a bid by
Greyhound Lines Inc to take immediate control Trailways Corp
prompted Greyhound to threaten -- in a brief filed with the
Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) -- to drop the merger
plan.
    Greyhound officials told Reuters late today the company
hoped for ICC action on the merger by tomorrow.
    "Greyhound Lines will go forward with the transaction only
if it is permitted to assume immediate, unconditional control
of Trailways' operations and to integrate them with its
operations," Greyhound said in a filing with the ICC, the
federal regulatory agency which has the final say over mergers
of interstate bus companies.
    But Justice had said in an earlier filing with the ICC that
it wanted the agency to move slowly on the plan and to turn
down Greyhound's request to begin operating Trailways
immediately.
    "The department has just begun to receive relevant
information on Trailways' financial condition and is in the
process of assessing the correctness of the company's
allegations," acting Assistant Attorney General Charles Rule
said in comments submitted to the ICC.
    Greyhound announced June 19 that it wanted the ICC to let
it begin operating Trailways immediately while continuing to
evaluate the merger for possible antitrust problems.
    Greyhound said it would pay 80 mln dlrs for many of
Trailways' terminals, buses and garages.
    The two companies said in papers filed with the ICC that
Trailways "could collapse in a matter of days."
    They said Trailways owed suppliers more than six mln dlrs,
with another six mln dlrs due June 30.
    The suppliers, they said, could force Trailways into
bankruptcy "at any time."
    Trailways also owes a consortium of banks 76 mln dlrs, and
the consortium has threatened to call the loan if Trailways
fails to pay the interest due June 30, they said.

any of its own shares.
    Earlier this month, Irving rejected the bid as inadequate
and said it wanted to retain its independence.
    In late September, Bank of New York offered 80 dlrs per
share in cash for 47.4 pct of Irving. For the remaining 52.6
pct, it offered an exchange of 1.9 shares of its shares for one
Irving share.
    At that time, the stock purchase portion was worth close to
80 dlrs per share, but now that portion is worth 53 dlrs per
share for a net price of 68 dlrs, one analyst said.
    According to the prospectus offer, shareholders may tender
for all cash or all shares on a first come, first serve basis.
    Analysts were mixed about how the stock price drop would
affect the acquisition.
    "If it gets to the Irving shareholders, they would approve
it, but Irving hopes the offer won't go to the shareholders,"
said Mark Alpert, banking analyst with Bear Stearns Cos Inc.
    "And the market is saying the deal won't go through,"
Alpert said.
    "The transaction looks highly unlikely to be completed at
present. If Irving wouldn't go with the offer at 80 dlrs a
share, then they won't go at a lower price," another analyst
said.
    The analyst also doubted that Bank of New York could afford
to retain its original offer.
    However, industry sources were more uncertain about
prospects for the deal.
    "With Irving's price so low, Bank of New York's offer will
look good to Irving shareholders," said Michael Flores, a
consultant at Bank Earnings International, a consulting firm.
    The drop of Irving's share to 44 dlrs per share, which is
about a 26 dlr drop from the beginning of last week, increases
the chance that Bank of New York will succeed, Flores said.
    Analysts said that the drop in bank stock prices is likely
to depress the level of mergers and acquisition in the banking
industry.
    "Bank takeovers are less likely because banks can't use
their own stock to make acquisitions because their share price
is too depressed," Alpert said.
    Since only banks can buy another bank, the only other
possible acquirors would be a foreign bank, Alpert said.
    "In the market drop the stock of acquirors got clobbered
more than the acquirees," another analyst said.
