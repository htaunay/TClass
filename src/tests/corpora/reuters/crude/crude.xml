scheduled June session to readdress its production cutting
agreement if the organization wants to halt the current slide
in oil prices, oil industry analysts said.
    "The movement to higher oil prices was never to be as easy
as OPEC thought. They may need an emergency meeting to sort out
the problems," said Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge Energy
Research Associates, CERA.
    Analysts and oil industry sources said the problem OPEC
faces is excess oil supply in world oil markets.
    "OPEC's problem is not a price problem but a production
issue and must be addressed in that way," said Paul Mlotok, oil
analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc.
    He said the market's earlier optimism about OPEC and its
ability to keep production under control have given way to a
pessimistic outlook that the organization must address soon if
it wishes to regain the initiative in oil prices.
    But some other analysts were uncertain that even an
emergency meeting would address the problem of OPEC production
above the 15.8 mln bpd quota set last December.
    "OPEC has to learn that in a buyers market you cannot have
deemed quotas, fixed prices and set differentials," said the
regional manager for one of the major oil companies who spoke
on condition that he not be named. "The market is now trying to
teach them that lesson again," he added.
    David T. Mizrahi, editor of Mideast reports, expects OPEC
to meet before June, although not immediately. However, he is
not optimistic that OPEC can address its principal problems.
    "They will not meet now as they try to take advantage of the
winter demand to sell their oil, but in late March and April
when demand slackens," Mizrahi said.
    But Mizrahi said that OPEC is unlikely to do anything more
than reiterate its agreement to keep output at 15.8 mln bpd."
    Analysts said that the next two months will be critical for
OPEC's ability to hold together prices and output.
    "OPEC must hold to its pact for the next six to eight weeks
since buyers will come back into the market then," said Dillard
Spriggs of Petroleum Analysis Ltd in New York.
    But Bijan Moussavar-Rahmani of Harvard University's Energy
and Environment Policy Center said that the demand for OPEC oil
has been rising through the first quarter and this may have
prompted excesses in its production.
    "Demand for their (OPEC) oil is clearly above 15.8 mln bpd
and is probably closer to 17 mln bpd or higher now so what we
are seeing characterized as cheating is OPEC meeting this
demand through current production," he told Reuters in a
telephone interview.

published today, said there were no plans for an emergency OPEC
meeting to review oil policies after recent weakness in world
oil prices.
    Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah was quoted by the local
daily al-Qabas as saying: "None of the OPEC members has asked
for such a meeting."
    He denied Kuwait was pumping above its quota of 948,000
barrels of crude daily (bpd) set under self-imposed production
limits of the 13-nation organisation.
    Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimate
OPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above a ceiling of 15.8 mln
bpd agreed in Geneva last December.
    They named Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, along with
the much smaller producer Ecuador, among those producing above
quota. Kuwait, they said, was pumping 1.2 mln bpd.
    "This rumour is baseless. It is based on reports which said
Kuwait has the ability to exceed its share. They suppose that
because Kuwait has the ability, it will do so," the minister
said.
    Sheikh Ali has said before that Kuwait had the ability to
produce up to 4.0 mln bpd.
    "If we can sell more than our quota at official prices,
while some countries are suffering difficulties marketing their
share, it means we in Kuwait are unusually clever," he said.
    He was referring apparently to the Gulf state of qatar,
which industry sources said was selling less than 180,000 bpd
of its 285,000 bpd quota, because buyers were resisting
official prices restored by OPEC last month pegged to a marker
of 18 dlrs per barrel.
    Prices in New York last week dropped to their lowest levels
this year and almost three dollars below a three-month high of
19 dollars a barrel.
    Sheikh Ali also delivered "a challenge to any international
oil company that declared Kuwait sold below official prices."
    Because it was charging its official price, of 16.67 dlrs a
barrel, it had lost custom, he said but did not elaborate.
    However, Kuwait had guaranteed markets for its oil because
of its local and international refining facilities and its own
distribution network abroad, he added.
    He reaffirmed that the planned meeting March 7 of OPEC"s
differentials committee has been postponed until the start of
April at the request of certain of the body"s members.
    Ecuador"s deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite said
last Wednesday his debt-burdened country wanted OPEC to assign
a lower official price for its crude, and was to seek this at
talks this month of opec"s pricing committee.
    Referring to pressure by oil companies on OPEC members, in
apparent reference to difficulties faced by Qatar, he said: "We
expected such pressure. It will continue through March and
April." But he expected the situation would later improve.

political crossroads over measures to deregulate its protected
economy, the U.S. Embassy says in a new report.
    To counter falling oil revenues, the government has
launched a series of measures over the past nine months to
boost exports outside the oil sector and attract new
investment.
    Indonesia, the only Asian member of OPEC and a leading
primary commodity producer, has been severely hit by last year"s
fall in world oil prices, which forced it to devalue its
currency by 31 pct in September.
    But the U.S. Embassy report says President Suharto"s
government appears to be divided over what direction to lead
the economy.
    "(It) appears to be nearing a crossroads with regard to
deregulation, both as it pertains to investments and imports,"
the report says. It primarily assesses Indonesia"s agricultural
sector, but also reviews the country"s general economic
performance.
    It says that while many government officials and advisers
are recommending further relaxation, "there are equally strong
pressures being exerted to halt all such moves."
    "This group strongly favours an import substitution economy,"
the report says.
    Indonesia"s economic changes have been welcomed by the World
Bank and international bankers as steps in the right direction,
though they say crucial areas of the economy like plastics and
steel remain highly protected, and virtual monopolies.
    Three sets of measures have been announced since last May,
which broadened areas for foreign investment, reduced trade
restrictions and liberalised imports.
    The report says Indonesia"s economic growth in calendar 1986
was probably about zero, and the economy may even have
contracted a bit. "This is the lowest rate of growth since the
mid-1960s," the report notes.
    Indonesia, the largest country in South-East Asia with a
population of 168 million, is facing general elections in
April.
    But the report hold out little hope for swift improvement
in the economic outlook. "For 1987 early indications point to a
slightly positive growth rate not exceeding one pct. Economic
activity continues to suffer due to the sharp fall in export
earnings from the petroleum industry."
    "Growth in the non-oil sector is low because of weak
domestic demand coupled with excessive plant capacity, real
declines in construction and trade, and a reduced level of
growth in agriculture," the report states.
    Bankers say continuation of present economic reforms is
crucial for the government to get the international lending its
needs.
    A new World Bank loan of 300 mln dlrs last month in balance
of payments support was given partly to help the government
maintain the momentum of reform, the Bank said.

slightly from last year's decline in world oil prices,
announced its first budget since early 1985 and projected a
deficit of 5.472 billion riyals.
    The deficit compared with a shortfall of 7.3 billion riyals
in the last published budget for 1985/86.
    In a statement outlining the budget for the fiscal year
1987/88 beginning today, Finance and Petroleum Minister Sheikh
Abdul-Aziz bin Khalifa al-Thani said the government expected to
spend 12.217 billion riyals in the period.
    Projected expenditure in the 1985/86 budget had been 15.6
billion riyals.
    Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said government revenue would be about
6.745 billion riyals, down by about 30 pct on the 1985/86
projected revenue of 9.7 billion.
    The government failed to publish a 1986/87 budget due to
uncertainty surrounding oil revenues.
    Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said that during that year the government
decided to limit recurrent expenditure each month to
one-twelfth of the previous fiscal year's allocations minus 15
pct.
    He urged heads of government departments and public
institutions to help the government rationalise expenditure. He
did not say how the 1987/88 budget shortfall would be covered.
    Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said plans to limit expenditure in
1986/87 had been taken in order to relieve the burden placed on
the country's foreign reserves.
    He added in 1987/88 some 2.766 billion riyals had been
allocated for major projects including housing and public
buildings, social services, health, education, transport and
communications, electricity and water, industry and
agriculture.
    No figure was revealed for expenditure on defence and
security. There was also no projection for oil revenue.
    Qatar, an OPEC member, has an output ceiling of 285,000
barrels per day.
    Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said: "Our expectations of positive signs
regarding (oil) price trends, foremost among them OPEC's
determination to shoulder its responsibilites and protect its
wealth, have helped us make reasonable estimates for the coming
year's revenue on the basis of our assigned quota."

reiterated the kingdom's commitment to last December's OPEC
accord to boost world oil prices and stabilise the market, the
official Saudi Press Agency SPA said.
    Asked by the agency about the recent fall in free market
oil prices, Nazer said Saudi Arabia "is fully adhering by the
... Accord and it will never sell its oil at prices below the
pronounced prices under any circumstance."
    Nazer, quoted by SPA, said recent pressure on free market
prices "may be because of the end of the (northern hemisphere)
winter season and the glut in the market."
    Saudi Arabia was a main architect of the December accord,
under which OPEC agreed to lower its total output ceiling by
7.25 pct to 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) and return to fixed
prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel.
    The agreement followed a year of turmoil on oil markets,
which saw prices slump briefly to under 10 dlrs a barrel in
mid-1986 from about 30 dlrs in late 1985. Free market prices
are currently just over 16 dlrs.
    Nazer was quoted by the SPA as saying Saudi Arabia's
adherence to the accord was shown clearly in the oil market.
    He said contacts among members of OPEC showed they all
wanted to stick to the accord.
    In Jamaica, OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman, who is also
Nigerian Oil Minister, said the group planned to stick with the
pricing agreement.
    "We are aware of the negative forces trying to manipulate
the operations of the market, but we are satisfied that the
fundamentals exist for stable market conditions," he said.
    Kuwait's Oil Minister, Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah, said
in remarks published in the emirate's daily Al-Qabas there were
no plans for an emergency OPEC meeting to review prices.
    Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimate
OPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above the 15.8 mln ceiling.
    They named Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, along with
the much smaller producer Ecuador, among those producing above
quota. Sheikh Ali denied that Kuwait was over-producing.

to an average of 3.5 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 3.8 mln bpd
in January, Gulf oil sources said.
    They said exports from the Ras Tanurah and Ju'aymah
terminals in the Gulf fell to an average 1.9 mln bpd last month
from 2.2 mln in January because of lower liftings by some
customers.
    But the drop was much smaller than expected after Gulf
exports rallied in the fourth week of February to 2.5 mln bpd
from 1.2 mln in the third week, the sources said.
    The production figures include neutral zone output but not
sales from floating storage, which are generally considered
part of a country's output for Opec purposes.
    Saudi Arabia has an Opec quota of 4.133 mln bpd under a
production restraint scheme approved by the 13-nation group
last December to back new official oil prices averaging 18 dlrs
a barrel.
    The sources said the two-fold jump in exports last week
appeared to be the result of buyers rushing to lift February
entitlements before the month-end.
    Last week's high export levels appeared to show continued
support for official Opec prices from Saudi Arabia's main crude
customers, the four ex-partners of Aramco, the sources said.
    The four -- Exxon Corp <XON>, Mobil Corp <MOB>, Texaco Inc
<TX> and Chevron Corp <CHV> -- signed a long-term agreement
last month to buy Saudi crude for 17.52 dlrs a barrel.
    However the sources said the real test of Saudi Arabia's
ability to sell crude at official prices in a weak market will
come this month, when demand for petroleum products
traditionally tapers off. Spot prices have fallen in recent
weeks to more than one dlr below Opec levels.
    Saudi Arabian oil minister Hisham Nazer yesterday
reiterated the kingdom's commitment to the December OPEC accord
and said it would never sell below official prices.
    The sources said total Saudi refinery throughput fell
slightly in February to an average 1.1 mln bpd from 1.2 mln in
January because of cuts at the Yanbu and Jubail export
refineries.
    They put crude oil exports through Yanbu at 100,000 bpd
last month, compared to zero in January, while throughput at
Bahrain's refinery and neutral zone production remained steady
at around 200,000 bpd each.

April one for the debut of a new procedure in the energy
complex that will increase the use of energy futures worldwide.
     On April one, NYMEX will allow oil traders that do not
hold a futures position to initiate, after the exchange closes,
a transaction that can subsequently be hedged in the futures
market, according to an exchange spokeswoman.
    "This will change the way oil is transacted in the real
world," said said Thomas McKiernan, McKiernan and Co chairman.
    Foreign traders will be able to hedge trades against NYMEX
prices before the exchange opens and negotiate prices at a
differential to NYMEX prices, McKiernan explained.
     The expanded program "will serve the industry because the
oil market does not close when NYMEX does," said Frank Capozza,
secretary of Century Resources Inc.
     The rule change, which has already taken effect for
platinum futures on NYMEX, is expected to increase the open
interest and liquidity in U.S. energy futures, according to
traders and analysts.
    Currently, at least one trader in this transaction, called
an exchange for physical or EFP, must hold a futures position
before entering into the transaction.
    Under the new arrangement, neither party has to hold a
futures position before entering into an EFP and one or both
parties can offset their cash transaction with a futures
contract the next day, according to exchange officials.
    When NYMEX announced its proposed rule change in December,
NYMEX President Rosemary McFadden, said, "Expansion of the EFP
provision will add to globalization of the energy markets by
providing for, in effect, 24-hour trading."

    He said Opec had expected to see some fluctuations in the
spot price. "We hope the weak price will be overcome, and
predict the price will be better in the third and fourth
quarters."
    Refiners, he said, appeared to have used up old stock
deliberately to cause slack demand in the market and the price
to fall. But Opec would get through this period if members
stuck together.

over 17.00 dlrs a barrel because of Saudi Arabia's determined
effort to support prices, analysts said.
    "The Saudis and other OPEC nations are jawboning the market,
hoping to restore confidence and prices and to do this without
another meeting," said Sanford Margoshes, oil analyst with
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
    "But OPEC is not out of the woods yet by a longshot due to
seasonal declines in demand and some cheating," he added.
    Oil industry analysts said Saudi Arabia has led the attempt
to get other OPEC members to resist pressures to discount from
the official prices agreed to last december.
    The analysts said that to get others to hold the line,
Saudi Arabia pushed hard at the meeting of deputy oil ministers
of the Gulf Cooperation Council last weekend and at the
Cooperation Council oil ministers' meeting the previous week.
    The Saudis have also offered to support members having
difficulty in selling their oil, analysts said.
    "They are trying to make sure that no one discounts, and to
prevent that, it appears that Saudi Arabia or some other OPEC
member will allocate some of their oil sales to help members
that lose sales," Margoshes said.
    He added that the allocations would probably be in the form
of loans to be repaid when these nations resume sales.
    Analysts said this would be useful in keeping in line
nations like Qatar, which has had trouble selling oil. But it
is also likely that such assistance would be provided to
Nigeria which is under pressure to extend discounts.
    Analysts said that Saudi Arabia, with assistance from OPEC
president Rilwanu Lukman, was trying to avoid an emergency OPEC
meeting for fear that it would give the appearance that the
December pact is falling apart.
    Daniel McKinley, oil analyst with Smith Barney, Upham
Harris and Co said, "both physical and futures markets have been
oversold and it only took a small spark to bring on a short
covering rally."
    He believes an Iranian trade mission to Tokyo, which
refused discounts to Japanese buyers, brought Japanese refiners
into the market to cover their short positions.
    Oil traders said one japanese refiner came into the market
to but 10 cargoes of May Dubai, which sent prices up on Mideast
sours, with Dubai trading up to 16.50 dlrs after trading
yeterray as low as 15.63 dlrs and then spilled over into the
North sea crude oil market.
    Traders said that there have been persistent rumors today
that Japanese buyers are looking to pick up cargoes of Brent
for Japan and European trade sources indidate rumors of vessels
being fixed to make such shipments.
    North sea brent today rose over 17.00 dlrs with trades
reported as high as 17.05 dlrs, up one dlr.
    OPEC members' denials that they are producing over their
quotas sparked moves to cover short postitions.
    Indonesian oil minister Subroto said today that OPEC
production was below the 15.8 mln bpd quota agreed to last
december but he gave no details on OPEC production against
claims it was more at least one mln bpd above that level.
    "The production probably is about their quota level and
largely because Saudi Arabia will not discount and canot sell
its oil as a result," Margoshes said.
    Analysts have mixed opinions about the extent of the
current rally. Some believe prices can continue to rise if
Saudi Arabia and OPEC hold steady in a refusal to discount.
    But others said that despite the rally today there were
still several fundamental factors, including demand, which
could cut the rally short.
    Marion Stewart, an indepedent petroleum economist, said
slow growth in the economies of the U.S. and OECD would keep
demand for oil slack and he now estimates that demand to rise
about 1.4 pct over 1986.

other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries to stay within their production quotas, said Morgan
Stanley Group managing director John Wellemeyer.
    Wellemeyer, speaking to reporters at an offshore oil
engineering conference, also said he expected OPEC nations to
attempt to hold prices under 20 dlrs a barrel for several years
to keep industrial demand for residual fuel oil strong.
    "Over the next few weeks I think you'll see a concerted
effort by the Saudis to get production down," Wellemeyer said.
    "The Saudis are committed to that price level (of 18 dlrs a
barrel) and are willing to make it happen again," he said.
    In recent weeks, oil prices fell to the 16 to 17 dlrs a
barrel level on market reports of some OPE members producing
above their quota, pushing total OPEC production to 15.8 mln
barrels per day. But prices rebounded today, with April U.S.
crude prices up about one dlr to over 17 dlrs a barrel on a
belief Saudi Arabia is attempting to curb OPEC output.
    Wellemeyer said that sharp declines in U.S. oil production
could push demand for OPEC oil above 20 mln barrels per day as
early as 1989 and up to 24 mln barrels per day by 1993.
    Although the projected increases in demand for OPEC oil
should strengthen world prices, Wellemeyer said he believed the
organization would hold its official price below 20 dlrs a
barrel for some time to prevent residual fuel users from
switching to natural gas supplies. The interfuel swing market
accounts for about eight mln barrels a day, or 18 pct of the
world demand for oil.

likely to continue at last year's sharply reduced levels
despite recent gains in crude oil prices, industry analysts
said.
    Because much of the crude oil in California fields is
thick, heavy and expensive to extract, oil prices would have to
increase to near 1985's levels before any significant recovery
is seen in drilling, they said.
    "Companies will probably only drill their best prospects,"
said John Curti, an analyst with Birr Wilson Securities Inc.
    Few new wells now are being drilled.
    Only 33 rigs, about one-quarter of the total available,
were drilling for oil onshore in California last week, compared
to about 70 last year, said Bill Bolster of Munger Oil
Information Services, which tracks California drilling
activity.
    "It's in the dregs right now," said Bolster of the state's
drilling activity.
    Current prices are not enough to justify increased
drilling, said Ed Malmgreen of the California Independent
Producers Association.
    While an Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pact
to curb production boosted oil prices early this year, prices
eventually fell.
    Prices for California's marker grade, Line 63 blend, have
slumped about 20 pct in the last month to 14 dlrs from a high
of about 17 dlrs.
    More than half of California's oil comes from stripper
wells, those producing less than 10 barrels a day, and that
much of that oil costs between 18 and 25 dlrs a barrel to
extract, Malmgreen said.
    "It's not unusual for a stripper well to cost 18 dlrs,"
Malmgreen said.
    Many stripper wells along the southern California coast
produce eight times as much water as crude oil, and inland
wells frequently require the use of steam injection to spur
extraction of the thick, heavy oil, he said.
    The outlook for future production in California is clouded
by a lack of exploratory drilling now, analysts said.
    In the heart of California's oil patch, Kern County, which
produces about two-thirds of the state's oil, exploratory
drilling has slowed to a crawl.
    Only 55 exploratory wells were drilled in Kern County in
1986, compared to 137 in 1985, according to David Mitchell of
the state energy commission. So far this year only five
exploratory wells have been drilled.
    "I don't think they'll even get to what they did last
year," Mitchell said.
    No pickup in exploratory drilling is likely for the rest of
the decade, Mitchell said.
    Along with the fall in drilling has come a decrease in the
number of producing wells and overall production.
    Between February and October of 1986, the number of
producing oil wells in California fell 14 pct to 43,521 from
more than 50,000, said Bill Guerard of the California Energy
Commission.
    In line with that decrease, California's crude oil output
fell about 10 pct last year due to low oil prices and is
expected to remain at that lower level, analysts said.
    Between February and October 1986, California's crude oil
production slipped from an all-time high of 1.185 mln barrels
per day to 1.066 mln bpd, Guerard said.
    Total estimated crude oil production in California for 1986
was 408 mln bbls, compared with 424 mln bbls in 1985 and 405
mln bbl in 1983, according to the California Department of
Conservation.
    "Production in 1987 will probably hold around 1986 levels,"
Guerard said.

Nugent, saying that the ailing oilpatch cannot wait for
Congress to act, today urged Texas state lawmakers to adopt
incentives to find new oil reserves and to exempt severance
taxes on oil produced from stripper wells.
    Nugent said in a speech to the Texas house of
representatives that the state must take the initiative in
molding U.S. energy policy and finding new ways to assist
troubled oil producers.
    His proposal to revitalize Texas' oil industry would exempt
stripper wells that produce 10 barrels of oil or less each day
from the state's 4.6 pct severance tax. He said that the
majority of Texas' oil wells fall within the stripper well
category and a price swing of two to three dlrs a barrel can be
crucial in determining if the well remains in production.
    Nugent also called for state lawmakers to exempt new
wildcat wells from the state severance tax for up to five years
as a financial incentive to explore for new oil reserves.
    Secondary and tertiary oil production, expensive methods of
production that inject water or gas into the ground to recover
oil, should also be exempted from the severance tax, Nugent
said. His plan would exempt existing secondary and tertiary
wells that produce at a rate of less than three barrels a day
for three years, or until the price of oil reaches $25 a
barrel.
    "We've been sitting back and waiting on two federal
administrations to develop a coherent energy policy for the
nation to follow. I say we have waited long enough," Nugent
said. "In other words, let's tell Washington to either lead,
follow, or get out of the way."
    Nugent said that the financial losses to the state treasury
by exempting marginal oil production from state severance taxes
would be more than made up by stimulating new business for the
oil supply and service industry.

days of March was running at about 14.7 mln bpd, down from a 16
mln bpd average for February and well below the 15.8 mln bpd
ceiling the group adopted in December, a Reuter survey shows.
    The figures were polled by Reuters correspondents from oil
traders, industry executives and analysts in Europe, the Middle
East, Africa, Latin America and Asia.
    They back recent statements by OPEC ministers that the
group is producing within its ceiling to support the return to
a fixed price system, which came into effect last month.
    OPEC output for the whole of February was about 200,000 bpd
above the ceiling, largely because of overproduction by the
United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, the figures show.
    The UAE, together with the much smaller producer Ecuador,
was also producing above quota in the first days of March, the
survey reveals.
    But such overproduction was compensated for by a sharp fall
in Saudi Arabian output, together with Iran"s inability to
export as much as its quota allows.
    Iraq rejected its OPEC quota of 1.466 mln bpd and produced
1.75 mln bpd in February and early March, the figures showed.
    Saudi output -- excluding movements into stocks -- fell to
3.1 mln bpd in early March from 3.5 mln bpd in February,
against a 4.133 mln bpd quota. The Saudi figures include a
200,000 bpd share of Neutral Zone production.
    Kuwait, which has consistently denied quota violations, was
estimated to be pumping 1.4 mln bpd in February and 1.15 in
early March -- both figures including 200,000 bpd as its share
of Neutral Zone output -- against its 948,000 bpd quota.
    Reports of customer resistance to fixed prices set by some
OPEC states were reflected in output from Qatar and Nigeria,
both substantially under quota in February and early March.
    Qatar's February output was 230,000 bpd, and this fell to
180,000 bpd in early March compared with its 285,000 bpd quota.
    Industry sources say Japanese buyers are resisting Qatar"s
prices and Gulf Arab oil states have pledged to make up for any
shortfall in sales which a fellow Gulf state suffers.
    Nigeria's early March output was about one mln bpd, down
from 1.14 mln bpd in February and its quota of 1.238 mln bpd.
    Industry sources say Nigeria's customers believe its Bonny
grades are overpriced compared with compatible Brent crudes
from the U.K. North Sea.

the 15.8 mln bpd ceiling it set in December and all countries
are strictly adhering to their quotas, the OPEC news agency
Opecna quoted an OPEC secretariat official as saying.
    The official was quoted as saying that lower output was the
result "of member countries' firm determination to defend the
organisation's official price of 18 dlrs per barrel, and to
refrain from selling any quantity below that price."
    The unnamed official was further quoted as saying that no
OPEC meeting was foreseen before the next biannual OPEC session
planned to start on June 25.
    The official gave no figure for February output. The
statement said only that "the reduction in total supplies,
namely actual exports of crude oil and products, plus local
deliveries in member countries, is even more pronounced as
those supplies fell very noticeably during that month."
    "No matter what the pressure on member countries by lifters
to align the official selling price to the ongoing market
price, member countries are, without exception, strictly
adhering to the official selling price in spite of the
financial hardship this may entail," the statement said.
    "The very recent improvement in the price structure is an
indicator of such determination by the organization to stick to
the official selling price," the statement said.
    Free spot market prices rose from around 14.50 dlrs a
barrel in early December last year to near OPEC's official
levels towards the end of the year, after the OPEC pact.
    There has been oil industry speculation that OPEC might
have to hold an extraordinrary meeting prior to its scheduled
June session to discuss reports of overproduction by some
states and strains on the differential matrix, which prices
each OPEC crude according to its quality and distance from main
markets.
    The official said in the statement that no such emergency
session was scheduled "because of member countries' firm
determination to defend the price (system)" agreed in December.
    Opec"s differential committee was to have met in Vienna
starting April 2 but this session has been postponed, with no
new date set, according to an official of the United Arab

said the group was producing well below the 15.8 mln bpd
ceiling it set in December, partly because liftings had been
delayed or postponed by customers unwilling to pay fixed Opec
prices.
    Lukman, during a brief visit to London on his way home from
Jamaica, told Reuters in a telephone interview that in
February, Opec had underproduced partly because members were
strictly abiding by production quotas and partly because they
were resisting the temptation to sell at discounts to official
prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel.
    "We are determined to stand firm by the (December) accord,"
he said. "I have spoken to every other Opec minister and they
are committed to making the accord work," he said.
    Lukman gave no specific figures for February output. He
said the Opec secretariat in Vienna was finalizing these
figures.
    Told of a Reuters survey published today which estimated
that Opec output so far this week was below 15 mln bpd, he
said; "That could well be correct."
    Opec"s news agency Opecna today issued a statement saying
group output was "well below" its ceiling in February. But it
gave no figures.
    But one source close to Opec indicated that February output
may have been between 15.3 and 15.5 mln bpd.
    The Reuter survey estimated Opec February output at around
16 mln bpd.
    Opec agreed in December to cut output by 7.25 pct to 15.8
mln bpd and to return to fixed prices starting February 1.
    Lukman said Qatar, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Iran had all
produced in February below their Opec quotas. Iraq, which said
it would not honour its 1.466 mln bpd quota under the December
pact, had produced less than had been anticipated, he said.
    Lukman said that some industry reports "may be correct" that
in February, Nigeria propuced 75-100,000 bpd below its 1.238
mln bpd quota, Saudi Arabia 500,000 bpd less than its 4.133 mln
allocation and Qatar 20 to 30 pct under its 285,000 bpd quota.
    He said that sweet crudes such as those produced by his
country were coming under price pressure because they were
currently officially priced above sweet North Sea grades and
the United States" West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude.
    However, he said Opec in December had anticipated that
demand would be slack at this time of year for seasonal reasons
and expected the market to firm in two to three weeks.
    "We have to be patient for two or three weeks. The market is
now firming on actual fundamentals," he said, adding that he
expected it to go "up and up" even beyond official prices after
early April. This is when, traditionally, there is more demand
for gasoline-rich crudes such as Nigeria"s.
    The Opec President said producers such as Kuwait, Venezuela
and Indonesia were having less problems with output than
producers like his own country because they exported oil
products.
    Also, some of Venezuela"s heavy grades were outside the Opec
pricing system, he said.
    Lukman said that if refiner-buyers, now refusing to lift
some Opec oil at official prices, instead used their own stocks
and ran them down to "dangerous levels," they would eventually
have to buy Opec oil.
    "When they realise it is not a free-for-all (in the market)
they will realise they should buy now instead of paying more
later on," he said.
    Lukman, asked about industry reports that Nigeria was being
pressured by equity producers for better terms, said it was
important to know that terms with them were negotiable,
flexible and under constant review, not only when the market
seemed weak.
    He said that so far, no meeting of the seven-nation
ministerial differentials committee had been scheduled and that
such a meeting, now twice-postponed, was not a high priority

    April crude closed 24 cts higher to 17.75 dlrs. April
heating oil was 1.47 cts higher to 47.91 cts a gallon.
    "Most traders expected follow through profit-taking from

OPEC is producing within its quota," said Simon Greenshields, a
vice president with Morgan Stanley and Co Inc.
    News today, including OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman
statement that OPEC February production did not exceed its
official quota of 15.8 mln barrels per day, helped bouy prices,
traders said. A Reuter survey found OPEC production in early
March was 14.7 mln bpd.
    In addition to short-covering, heating oil found support
from traders buying it against sales of gasoline and crude, as

    A few OPEC countries last month exceeded the production
quotas set at their last conference in December, but liftings

 ]]></BODY><BODY><![CDATA[U.S. crude oil prices rose above 18 
dlrs a barrel this week and industry analysts said the price
could rise another dollar as inventories fall.
    "OPEC is keeping its production down, and in the cash market
there is tight supply of crude with short transportation time
to major refining centers," said Daniel McKinley, oil analyst
with Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. "That could send prices
50 cts to a dollar higher," he added.
    The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate rose to
18.15 dlrs a barrel today, a rise of 1.50 dlrs this week.
    The rally in oil prices this week came after prices fell in
February more than two dlrs from its high of 18.25 dlrs a
barrel.
    "Oil traders were pulling prices down on the assumption that
oil stocks were building and OPEC was producing well above its
15.8 mln bpd quota, but now both of those assumptions have come
under question," McKinley said.
    Yesterday the International Energy Agency in its monthly
report said that oil stocks in the OECD area, or in
industrialized nations, were drawn down by 1.3 mln bpd during
the first quarter of this year.
    IEA estimates that the draw in oil stocks during the first
quarter of this year will come largely from oil companies whose
inventory levels by April one will be an estimated 326 mln
tonnes, or about 74 days consumption.
    Industry analysts also said the estimate of a 3.5 mln bpd
draw in stocks made by Shell Chairman Peter Holmes yesterday
fed speculation that other major companies were destocking.
    Traders said the destocking has come about as a result of a
so-called buyers strike, which kept refiners from buying
officially priced OPEC oil in an effort to get the organization
to offer discounts to the official price.
    "This struggle between the companies and OPEC is the
ultimate game of chicken but it will be resolved relatively
soon. I would imagine by about the middle of the month (March),"
the general trading manager of an international oil company
told Reuters in a telephone interview.
    For its part OPEC has moved to win this game by cutting
excess supplies from the market by a reduction of its own
output, traders said. A Reuter survey estimates OPEC output to
be 14.7 mln bpd this week.
    Also, an earthquake in Ecuador yesterday led it to suspend
oil exports indefintiely and force majeure its shipments.
    "This will reduce short-haul availabilities by about 250,000
bpd almost immediately and the longer the suspension continues,
the larger the draw in stocks will be for companies expecting
it to be there," McKinley said.
    International oil traders said that other short-haul
crudes, such as North Sea Brent, were also scarce because Asian
refiners bought the oil after absorbing a lot of the readily
available Mideast crudes earlier this week.
    If this pattern continues then oil companies will bid up
the price of oil as they purchase for their refineries, trading
managers at several companies told Reuters.
    But there were skeptics who said they wondered how long
OPEC can retain its unity if buyer resistance continues.
    Stephen Hanke, chief economist at Friedburg Commodity
Management, said OPEC production was lower "because of the
Saudi cut (to 3.1 mln bpd) and this could spell trouble if it
gives other members an incentive to exceed their quotas."
     He added, "The Saudis will be picking up the tab for other
members who produce over their quota, and the drain on the
Saudis will continue, forcing them to cut output maybe as low
as 2.5 mln bpd to support the 18 dlrs average price," he added.
    There are also signs of some OPEC crudes being sold in the
spot market at below OPEC official prices, traders said.
    Oil traders said Nigerian Brass River sold for delivery
into the U.S. Gulf at a price related to North Sea brent, which
traded this week at 17.60 dlrs, far below the official price of
18.92 dlrs for the similar quality Bonny Light.
    Iranian oil is also surfacing in the U.S. Gulf and the Far
East at reported discounts to its 17.50 dlrs official price.
    "There is a lot of oil priced on government-to-government
deals, which are below official prices and this is probably
being resold," one international trader said.

shipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last at
least four months, a senior Energy Ministry official said.
    The official said Ecuador could resume exports after
repairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline, which links
jungle oil fields at Lago Agrio to Balao on the Pacific coast.
It would take about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs to repair the pipeline,
the official, who did not want to be named, told Reuters.
Ecuador had enough oil to meet domestic demand for about 35
days and would have to import crude to supplement stocks.
    The earthquake last Thursday night registered six on the
12-point international Mercalli scale. The damage to the
pipeline was a severe economic blow to Ecuador, where oil
accounts for up to two-thirds of total exports and as much as
60 pct of government revenues.
    Financially pressed Ecuador, a member of the Organisation
of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was recently pumping
about 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, about 50,000 bpd
above the output quota assigned by the cartel, another Energy
Ministry spokesman said. Last year, it exported an average of
173,500 bpd, according to the central bank.
    However, Ecuador might build an emergency 25 km pipeline,
costing 15 to 20 mln dlrs, to hook up with a Colombian
pipeline, the first official said. He estimated it could take
about 60 days to build.
    Ecuador, squeezed by the slide in world oil prices in 1986,
had only 138 mln dlrs in net international reserves at the end
of January, about equal to one month's imports.
    It suspended interest payments in January on 5.4 billion
dlrs owed to about 400 private foreign banks. The country's
total foreign debt is 8.16 billion dlrs, the eighth largest in
Latin America.
    In Caracas, President Jaime Lusinchi said Venezuela would
loan five mln barrels of crude to Ecuador over the next three
months to make up for losses from damage to the pipeline.
    Ecuador asked for the loan to guarantee domestic supplies
and would ship an equivalent volume back to Venezuela in
repayment in May, Lusinchi said.
    A commission headed by Venezuelan Investment Fund Minister
Hector Hurtado and including representatives from the interior
and defence ministries and the state oil company Petroleos de
Venezuela will travel to Ecuador Tuesday to evaluate and

mln barrels of crude oil from the National Iranian Oil Company
(NIOC) at a substantial discount to the official price, and
Western traders have received even larger discounts, Japanese
traders involved in the transactions told Reuters.
    NIOC has sold its crude for March shipment to Japanese
customers with different formulas. One company has bought
800,000 barrels of Iranian Heavy at a straight discount of
30-35 cents below the official price, the sources said.
    Other deals have been fixed with prices linked to Oman and
Dubai spot prices less a discount, they said.

    Iran's discounted sales have not, however, managed to
reverse the bullish tone in the crude oil and products spot
markets, oil traders said.
    Market sentiment is being influenced more by the colder
weather in Europe, and reports that OPEC's February output was
below its self-imposed quota of 15.8 mln barrels per day.
    Firmer gas oil on the London futures, and more bullish
sentiment on the New York Mercantile Exchange futures market
are supporting spot price levels, they said.

    Another Japanese trading house has paid the official price
but through a processing arrangement will effectively receive a
discount, the sources said. "It's just disguised cheating," one
Japanese trader said.
    The sources said only one Japanese company had paid the
official price for Iranian oil. It has purchased 1.5 mln
barrels of Iranian Heavy for April shipment for refining in
Singapore. They said about nine VLCCs of Iranian crude have

state-owned oil company, said it will drill two delineation
wells this summer at the Terra Nova oil field offshore
Newfoundland.
    Evaluation of test results and preliminary engineering work
should put Petro-Canada in a position to propose a development
plan for the Terra Nova field in 1988, the company said.
    Depending on time required for regulatory approvals,
construction could begin in 1989, with first oil production as
early as 1991, Petro-Canada said.
    "We have a high degree of confidence that the western
portion of the (Terra Nova) field contains at least 11 mln
cubic meters of recoverable oil, or more than 70 mln barrels,
and that we could produce it economicly using a floating
production system," Petro-Canada said.
    The Terra-Nova field, lying 350 kilometers east of St.
John's and 35 kilometers southeast of Hibernia field, was
discovered by Petro-Canada in 1984.
    "We've had encouraging results from the eastern portion of
the field, and we hope this summer's drilling will prove up
additional reserves there," the company said.
    Petro-Canada believes Terra Nova field is a good commercial
prospect and the company wants to move some of those resources
towards development so it can start generating a return on
investments, Petro-Canada said.
    Petro-Canada, which will act as operator of the two wells,
has a 75 pct interest in the western portion of Graven block of
the Terra Nova field and a 26 pct interest in the field's East
Flank block, a company spokesman said later. Other field
participants include Canterra Energy Ltd, Mobil Oil Canada Ltd,
Gulf Canada Resources Inc, ICG Resources Ltd, Trillium
Exploration Corp and general partnership PAREX.
    Petro-Canada estimates reserves in the Terra Nova field's
Graven block of between 68 mln and 70 mln barrels of oil,
company spokesman Bob Foulkes said from Petro-Canada's Calgary
office.
    Combined reserves for Graven Block and the field's East
Flank block are estimated between 70 mln and 130 mln barrels,
he added.
    Petro-Canada expects to spend about 500 mln Canadian dlrs
to bring the field to production by about 1991, and the
development budget could double if the company builds a
production system combining both blocks in the field, he said.
    Petro-Canada estimates the Terra Nova field Graven block
would produce between 25,000 and 26,000 barrels average daily
production, with a production system that would have maximum
capacity of 40,000 bpd, company spokesman Foulkes said in
answer to a query.
    The company estimates a production system combining both
Graven and East Flank blocks in the Terra Nova field could
produce about 45,000 bpd average daily production, he said.

Refuge in Alaska should be opened up for leasing to oil
companies, DiBona said.
    "This is a battle the industry cannot afford to lose if the
nation is to continue to benefit from Alaskan oil," DiBona
said. Since 1986 U.S. oil production has fallen while
consumption rose and that has raised dependence on imported
oil, particularly from OPEC, DiBona said.

financier, said he believes the heady days the oil service
industry had in the early 1980s, when over 4,500 oil rigs were
once reported operating, will not return in his lifetime.
     Pickens told Reuters he expects the rig count to drop to
below 600 before recovering. He added that oil prices will
eventually rise to 35 dlrs, then to 50 dlrs after 1990.
     Currently, some 700 oil rigs are operating in the U.S.,
down sharply after oil prices slipped from 30 dlrs in late 1985
to around 10 dlrs in 1986. Prices are now around 18 dlrs. The
highest number of working rigs was 4,500 in December 1981.
     "The rigs won't go back to work until the price of oil
gets above 30 dlrs," he said, adding that while he expects to
see 50 dlr a barrel oil, he does not expect to see 2,000 rigs

     Pickens, who is currently touring the country promoting

    He will meet UAE President Sheikh Zaid bin Sultan

    Aqazadeh arrived last night after a brief stopover in

    The official Saudi Press Agency quoted him as saying his
talks at Riyadh with Nazir had been constructive and good.
    Aqazadeh said Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC) members were agreed on holding production stable and he
reiterated the importance of maintaining oil prices.
    OPEC members agreed in December to limit production to 15.8
mln barrels per day for the first half of this year and on a
benchmark price of 18 dlrs a barrel from February 1.
    Aqazadeh also visted OPEC members Gabon, Algeria and Libya.

 ]]></BODY><BODY><![CDATA[King Fahd said today Saudi Arabia wants
oil price stability and he called on non-OPEC producers to
avoid harmful competition with the 13 nation group.
    His plea, in an interview with Reuters and the television
news agency Visnews, came ahead of a state visit he will make
to Britain later this month.
    King Fahd was asked whether Saudi Arabia would be prepared
to reduce its oil output below its OPEC quota of 4.133 mln
barrels per day (bpd) to defend the 18 dlr benchmark price
agreed to by OPEC last December.
    The King replied: "Saudi Arabia doesn't decide prices by
itself but certainly desires price stability."
    Non-OPEC countries "must help us in a framework of common
interest so that there is no type of competition which could
prove harmful to everyone," he said.
    Asked if he saw the 18 dlr per barrel benchmark as a first
step towards higher world oil prices, King Fahd said it was not
for Saudi Arabia but for all OPEC countries to determine such
issues. Iran and Algeria have already called for a higher
benchmark.
    In recent weeks the 18 dlr level has come under pressure,
due partly to quota violations by some OPEC members. King Fahd
said Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, was
adhering to decisions made at OPEC's December conference which
set a 15.8 mln bpd output ceiling for the first half of 1987.
    A major non-OPEC producer, Britain has so far resisted the
group's pleas to curb its North Sea oil output.
    The King also urged the world community to help the
Palestinians return to their homeland and called for a peaceful
end to the Iran-Iraq war. The 6-1/2-year-old war could not be
resolved on the battlefield, he said.

damage to its oil export pipeline caused by last week"s
earthquake, which will stop crude exports for five months,
energy and mines minister Javier Espinosa Teran said.
    Espinosa said yesterday the pipeline, which carries crude
from jungle fields to the Pacific Ocean coast of Balao, would
be repaired with the help of Texaco Inc <TX.N> and a Mexican
and an Argentine firm.
    President Leon Febres Cordero said two days ago that
Ecuador, an OPEC member, would have to suspend crude exports
for four months due to the quake.
    Oil traditionally accounts for up to two-thirds of
Ecuador's total exports and as much as 60 pct of government
revenues.
    Deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite said Ecuador
would have to import six to seven mln barrels of crude oil to
meet its needs until the line was repaired.
    The Ecuadorean minister at the Presidency, Patricio
Quevedo, told reporters that Venezuela will lend Ecuador five
mln barrels of crude, which would repaid in kind after a
180-day period.
    He added the Caracas-based Andean Development Corp had
granted a loan of 11.7 mln dlrs towards repairing the pipeline,
50 km of which had been damaged in the quake.

verge of a recovery because of rising crude prices, oil
industry analysts said.
    The analysts, who issued buy recommendations on some
stocks, said the recovery in oil services should begin in the
second half of 1987, after drilling activity bottoms out in the
first half, and continue into the next decade.
     "People, however, cannot afford to wait for drilling to go
up to start buying," said Sandi Haber Sweeney, senior research
analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein and Co Inc.
    Among the recommended buys are Schlumberger Ltd <SLB>,
Halliburton Co <HAL>, Dresser Industries <DI>, Baker
International <BKO>, and McDermott International Inc <MDR>,
which may be the target of a takeover by Harold Simmons, a
Dallas-based investor.
    Analysts said although major oil companies are increasing
exploration and development overseas, they expect the pickup in
oil services will begin in the U.S.
    "Activity in the U.S. is so depressed it should move up
faster," said Vishnu Sharp of Goldman Sachs.
    The number of active oil drilling rigs in the U.S. was 766
last week compared with 1,212 rigs one year ago, Huges Tool Co
<HT> figures show.
    The average number of working rigs in the U.S. for 1987 is
projected at 978 versus 964 in 1986, according to Ike Kerridge,
vice president of stockholder relations at Hughes Tool. "The
first significant pickup in drilling activity will occur in the
second half of 1988," Kerridge said.
    Overseas drilling activity is expected to follow a similar
pattern, Kerridge said.
    "Halliburton is the best value," said Jeffrey Freedman,
vice president at Smith Barney, Harris and Upham Inc, adding
the company controls the greatest amount of liquidity of common
stock market value, is diversifed in non-oil field businesess,
and has the lowest multiple of stock price to operating cash
flow including debt.
    Schlumberger is Freedman's second favorite oil service
stock.
    "Schlumberger is expected to continue to be the dominant
technical leader in the industry," Freedman said.
    "Schlumberger's management shift, asset restructuring,
including a pending merger of Fairchild Semiconductor, and its
considerable cash horde sets the stage for the company to
maximize its significant industry advantage and capitalize on
the project upturn in exploration and development activity,"
according to a report by George Gaspar, first vice president at
Robert W. Baird and Co Inc.
    Gaspar estimates earnings per share for Schlumberger at 25
cts for 1987 and one to 1.75 dlrs in 1988 compared with 20 cts
in 1986 excluding a fourth quarter special charge of 1.87
billion dlrs.
    Bernstein's Sandi Sweeney is recommending a group of oil
service companies and said choosing among them is difficult.
Her favorite is Baker International, which is involved in a
possible merger with Hughes Tool Co.
    Dresser Industries will also benefit from the recovery but
possibly not as much as other companies because it is not a
pure service company, Sweeney said.
    Dresser is expected to improve profitability owing to cost
reductions and streamlined operations, including the sale and
leaseback of its headquarters, said Swarup.

fixed crude oil prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel and an
overall output ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) to
defend prices, its president Rilwanu Lukman said.
    He told a news conference here "After due consultation with
my colleagues in OPEC, I hereby wish to emphasize that Nigeria
and all member countries of OPEC remain determined to uphold
the December agreement by adhering strictly to their various
quotas and official selling prices."
    Lukman added no extraordinary OPEC conference was planned.
    "We are in a position to re-confirm that, despite misleading
news in foreign media to the contrary, ... OPEC member
countries as a whole produced below their agreed quota in the
month of February," Lukman, who is Nigerian oil minister, said.
    Lukman put the overall OPEC output shortfall in February at
900,000 bpd and said this was as a result of their firm
determination to defend official selling prices of 18 dlrs
agreed upon last December in Geneva.
    The December agreement set an overall output ceiling for
OPEC of 15.8 mln bpd for first half 1987 and restored fixed
prices as from February 1 around a reference point of 18 dlrs.
    Oil prices rallied immediately after the Geneva accord but
fell again last month on reports that OPEC was producing more
than the agreed level.
    "The idea was to suggest that OPEC's agreement would not
hold and this caused some customers to hold back purchases of
OPEC oil and resort to destocking to meet their needs," Lukman
said.
    He said the 900,000 bpd shortfall last February was based
on the verified figure for 10 out of OPEC's 13 members, adding
that Nigeria alone had a shortfall in production of 100,000
bpd.
    Iraq disassociated itself from the December agreement,
while the production figures of Ecuador and the United Arab
Emirates needed to be verified, Lukman said.
    "If that is the price we have to pay to make the agreement
succeed, we are ready ... OPEC is not changing its price level
of 18 dlrs," the group's president said.
    He said the OPEC price differentials committee meeting
formerly postponed to April had been put off indefinitely.
    "Furthermore, no extraordinary meeting of the conference is
at the moment contemplated since most agreements reached in
December are being adhered to," he said.
    Asked if the committee did not need to meet soon to narrow
the gaps in the prices of the various OPEC crudes -- fixed in
relation to the 18 dlr benchmark -- Lukman replied "We consider
the defence of our prices much more crucial than differentials."
    Lukman said OPEC was aware that consumers had heavily drawn
on stocks of both crude oil and refined products to levels well
below this time last year and soon they would return to the
market in search of crude.
    "We don't see that there is going to be any difficulty in
maintaining the 18 dlr price throughout the rest of the year,"
Lukman said.
    The OPEC president praised non-OPEC oil producers, which he
said had contributed to the group's efforts to stabilise
prices, but he criticised Britain for maintaining its long-held
view not to do anything to help the market.
    "We are quite confident, however, that in the long-term with
two-thirds of the world's reserves in OPEC hands, the future is
ours. We will use that advantage responsibly," he said.
    Lukman described the disruption in Ecuador's output
following an earthquake as tragic, but refused to say if the
South American country would be allowed a higher output quota
when it recovered from the disaster.

    Ecuador was obliged to suspend crude oil exports for an

pipeline linking its jungle oil fields with the Pacific port of

    Discussions are also under way to arrive at a formula to
compensate Ecuador for the loss in oil export revenue while the
pipeline is repaired, officials said.
    Santos Alvite last night met Venezuelan energy and mines

to renew term contracts to lift Iranian crude oil because spot
prices remain considerably lower than OPEC's official levels,
industry sources said.
    They said a cargo of the Mideast benchmark crude Dubai
traded yesterday at 16.50 dlrs a barrel, compared to its
official price of 17.42 dlrs.
    Only one Japanese company has renewed its term contract for
Iranian crude oil for the second quarter, the sources said.
    The sources said Japanese companies had been lifting a
total of about 185,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Iranian crude
under term contracts, but only one firm has agreed to lift in
the second quarter. It is lifting just 10,000 to 15,000 bpd.
    They said this move could inspire Iran to offer discounts
on cargoes loading in April, but the likelihood of discounts
depended largely on the levels of spot prices.
    "If the spot price of Dubai goes above 17.30 dlrs we would
probably buy Iranian crude at the official price," one Japanese
refiner said.
    "We don't intend to put pressure on them," he added.
    Buyers have little incentive to renew contracts to lift oil
at official OPEC prices while spot prices on all grades are
considerably lower, oil traders said.
    They said if spot prices move higher there will be no
problem finding OPEC crude to purchase at the official prices.
Qatar has chartered floating storage for its crude oil after
finding no buyers at official prices in March. The problem is
likely to recur in April, adding to that country's surplus.
    The traders added that Iraq had dissociated itself from
OPEC's December production agreement, while agreeing to the
fixed prices.
    But oil analysts said if OPEC keeps group output close to
its first-half 1987 ceiling of 15.8 mln bpd, supply and demand
would be balanced by the end of the second quarter.
    They also said if OPEC holds its official price structure
based on a reference price of 18 dlrs, spot price fluctuations
should be limited to a 16.50 to 17.20 dlrs range for Dubai and
a 17 to 18 dlrs range for the North Sea's Brent blend.
    One Japanese refiner said, "At the moment there's a lot of
pressure on OPEC, particularly on Qatar. But if they hold out
there will be no problem, and I'm beginning to trust their
ability."
    Nigerian oil minister and OPEC president Rilwanu Lukman
told a news conference in Lagos yesterday, "Nigeria and all
member countries of OPEC remain determined to uphold the
December agreement by adhering strictly to their various quotas
and official selling prices."
    He said OPEC believed consumers had drawn heavily on stocks
of both crude oil and refined products, reducing them to levels
well below this time last year. He said consumers would soon
return to the market in search of crude.
    A Japanese refiner said, "The European and U.S. Markets are
beginning to look better so OPEC might be quite lucky."

    They said Saudi Arabia was also selling oil from its crude
oil stocks in tankers around the world, which OPEC says must be
counted towards a member's production quota. Saudi Arabia's
quota is 4.133 mln bpd.
    The lower production levels indicated Saudi Arabia, the
world"s largest oil exporter, was insisting on getting Opec
official prices, even at the cost of lower production, the
sources said.
    King Fahd reiterated yesterday, in an interview with
Reuters and the television news agency Visnews, the Saudi
commitment to OPEC's December pact to boost oil prices to an
average 18 dlrs.
    "Saudi Arabia is completely sticking to OPEC decisions," he
said.
    The sources said the kingdom's exports from Gulf ports
averaged one mln bpd during the eight days ending last Sunday,
down from a February average of 1.9 mln bpd.
    They said Saudi Arabia was allowing production to fluctuate
with lifting nominations and was not trying to maintain
artificially high levels by putting oil into storage.
    The kingdom's main buyers, the four U.S. Oil firms with
past stakes in the national oil company Aramco -- Mobil, Exxon,
Texaco and Chevron -- enjoy considerable flexibility in the
timing and volume of their liftings but are bound to pay
official prices, the sources said.
    Spot market prices have firmed in the past two weeks but
still remain below OPEC levels and major buyers have delayed
liftings in the hope they would improve, the sources said.
    They expected low early March output to pick up towards the
end of the month as buyers sought to fulfill their contractual
obligations.

rejected an Interior Department draft plan to open wilderness
lands in Northern Alaska to oil and gas exploration.
    The federation, the nation's largest conservation group,
said further study was needed to assess any possible damage
that development might have on the wildlife in the area, the
coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
    Jay Hair, the federation's executive vice president, called
the Interior's research into the effects of development "so
fundamentally flawed that it provides little or no basis on
which to make a public policy decision."
    Hair called the department's proposal a "reflection of a
largely political decision," adding "we have no confidence in
Interior to represent the broad public interest in this area."
    Interior wants to open the 1.5 million acre coastal plain
to oil and gas exploration, but it said only with tough 
safeguards to protect the area's caribou and musk-oxen.
    It said a preliminary survey showed the region could hold
billions of barrels of oil and gas, and that its potential as
an energy resource would never be known without exploration.
    Interior said oil on the coastal plain could match the 10
billion barrels found at Prudhoe Bay, just west of the plain.
    Under existing law, Congress must agree to oil and gas
exploration, and if it does not act, the land will remain a
wildlife refuge protected from commercial development.
    Hair said Interior's report failed to stress the
probability that finding recoverable oil is only 19 pct.
    He said Interior's study also failed to weigh oil, gas,
fish and wildlife information the State of Alaska had gathered
nor had the department consulted the Environmental Protection
Agency on the possible effects of exploration.
    The federation, in letters to Congressmen, proposed that a
nine-member commission be set up to study all aspects of the
issue and report back to Congress in about two years.
    Hair said the federation was not opposed to the possible
exploration of oil, only that Interior's study was inadquate to
make a sound judgement.
    Congressional observers said that at present there was
little sentiment in Congress to open the wildlife area for
commercial exploitation dispite increasing concern that the
United States is becoming overly dependent on foreign oil.

is around 150,000 bpd. Compagnie Francaise de Raffinage (CFR)
will close the visbreaker at its La Mede refinery in early

    Despite current bullish sentiment in the Med, however,

Petrobras, cancelled a 40 mln dlr crude oil purchase from Saudi
Arabia after the Saudis refused to accept credit guarantees
from the Bank of Brazil, a Petrobras official said.
    Export director Carlos Santana told a press conference the
Saudis were the first suppliers of oil to impose such
conditions after Brazil's decision to halt interest payment of
its commercial debts last month.
    The shipment of 2.2 mln barrels represents two days of oil
consumption in Brazil.
    But Santana said if the Saudis change their minds and
decide to respect the terms of the contract, then Petrobras
will lift the order to cancel the shipment.
    Santana said if the Saudis do not accept Brazil's terms by
Monday then Petrobras will negotiate elsewhere.
    "Petrobras has been Saudi Arabia's traditional client since
1955. If they do not accept our conditions now, it will be much
better for us, because with the market prices more or less the
same, buying from Iraq and China is an advantage," he said.
    Iraq and China have barter deals with Brazil, importing
Brazilian goods in exchange for oil, but the Saudis buy nothing
from Brazil, he said.
    Santana said despite a strike threat by oil industry
workers and a two-week stoppage by Brazilian seamen, Petrobras
oil stocks are "reasonably balanced." 
    Saudi Arabia is Brazil's second biggest oil supplier, with
an average 115,000 bpd. Iraq is the main supplier with 235,000
bpd. China comes third, with 58,000 bpd.

a 26 km (16 mile) pipeline to link Ecuador's jungle oilfields
to a pipeline in Colombia through which Ecuadorean crude could
be pumped to the Pacific Coast, Ecuadorean energy minsitry

    They said it would take about two months and at least 15
mln dlrs to build the pipeline from Lago Agrio in Ecuador to
Puerto Colon, Colombia for connection to the Colombian
pipeline, which goes to the port of Tumaco on Colombia's
Pacific Ocean coast.
    The Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon pipeline is designed to
transport between 30,000 to 50,000 barrels of day (bpd) of
Ecuadorean crude to the Colombian pipeline, they said.
    The Colombian pipeline to Tumaco has ample room for
Ecuadorean crude, they said. It is currently transporting about
17,000 bpd out of its 100,000 bpd capacity, an Ecuadorean

said OPEC's December agreement to stabilise oil prices at 18
dlrs a barrel was being implemented satisfactorily and there
was no immediate need to change it.
    Nazer, in an interview with Reuters and the television news
agency Visnews, said Saudi Arabia was producing around three
mln barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil, well below its OPEC
quota.
    Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, will
continue to restrain production as long as other OPEC members
adhere to the pact, Nazer said.
    The 13-nation OPEC agreed in December to cut its production
ceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln bpd and abide by fixed prices
averaging 18 dlrs a barrel from February 1.
    Nazer, in his first interview since succeeding Ahmed Zaki
Yamani last October, said: "I do not foresee any need for new
measures before the 25th of June when our (next OPEC) meeting
will take place as scheduled."
    Nazer said OPEC was producing below 15.8 mln bpd and all
members were abiding by its agreements.
    "We've heard news every now and then of violations but they
were not at all verified," he said.
    OPEC production curbs have boosted world oil prices from a
13-year low of around eight dlrs a barrel last August to near
18 dlrs after announcement of the December pact.
    Spot market prices slipped some two dlrs in February but
have firmed in the past two weeks to near OPEC levels as
traders gained confidence in OPEC price and output discipline.
    Nazer said Saudi Arabia would continue to produce below its
4.133 mln bpd quota if necessary to defend the 18 dlr price.
    "As long as all the OPEC members adhere to the program as
devised in December, Saudi Arabia will continue to adhere to
the agreement," he said.
    Current production of three mln bpd includes oil from the
Neutral Zone shared with Kuwait, but not sales from floating
storage, Nazer said.
    King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, in an interview with Reuters and
Visnews on March 11, said the kingdom wanted oil price
stability and called on non-OPEC producers to avoid harmful
competition with OPEC.
    "Saudi Arabia doesn't decide prices by itself but certainly
desires price stability," he said.
    Nazer said the output level did not mean the kingdom had
returned to a role of "swing producer" within OPEC.
    Saudi Arabia allowed its output to sink as low as two mln
bpd in August 1985 to compensate for slack demand and
over-production by some OPEC states.
    "Saudi Arabia is not playing that role. It is being played
by OPEC membership as a whole because the reduction in the 15.8
mln bpd share of OPEC in the market is being shared by other
members of OPEC," Nazer said.
    Nazer said OPEC estimated demand for its oil during third
quarter this year would be around 16.6 mln bpd.
    But he said if circumstances changed "I am sure then the
OPEC members will consult with each other and take the
necessary measures."
    Oil analysts say the OPEC pact could come under strain when
demand for petroleum products generally falls in the northern
hemisphere spring and summer.
    Nazer said he was satisfied with the extent of cooperation
from non-OPEC producers. Norway, Egypt and the Soviet Union
agreed to help OPEC by restraining production or exports after
he visited them on OPEC's behalf earlier this year.
    "We did not ask any country to do anything. These were
programmes they thought were necessary to stabilise market
conditions and to help themselves attain better pricing
conditions," Nazer said.
    He said it was up to countries that declined to cooperate
-- such as Britain -- to come up with their own proposals if
they saw fit.

leaders assembled for a conference aimed at thrashing out
problems facing the private sector of the kingdom's
oil-dependent economy.
    The meeting of some 500 top businessmen from across Saudi
Arabia comes at a time of guarded optimism in industry and
commerce following the OPEC pact to boost world oil prices.
    The four-day conference in this resort town, high in the
mountains above the Tihamah plain stretching to the Red Sea,
has been organised by Saudi Arabia's chambers of commerce.
    Finance Minister Mohammed Ali Abal-Khail and Commerce
Minister Suleiman Abdulaziz al-Salim will attend the first day.
    Bankers and businessmen said the conference will air
problems facing commerce and industry after last year's slide
in oil prices and examine ways to promote higher investment in
a private sector sorely short of finance.
    Government planners have long recognised that Saudi Arabia,
the world's largest crude exporter, needs to foster private
enterprise to diversify its oil-based economy.
    The fledgling private sector was hard hit by the Middle
East recession as early as 1983 and several big manufacturing
and trading companies ran into problems repaying loans.
    Renewed optimism this year stems largely from the accord
reached by OPEC last December to curb oil output and boost
prices to a benchmark level of 18 dlrs per barrel.
    With oil prices recovering, Saudi Arabia went ahead at the
turn of the year with long-delayed budget plans incorporating a
52.7 billion riyal deficit to be bridged by drawing down
foreign reserves.
    The simple act of publishing a budget restored a measure of
confidence to the business community.
    Some share prices have risen by more than 35 pct since last
November, while banks are generally reporting a slowdown in the
number of new non-performing loans.
    But not all bankers are convinced. One senior corporate
finance manager in Riyadh said: "Banks are still reluctant to
lend ... There is certainly more optimism in the air, but I am
not sure if it is firmly based."
    Some businessmen and bankers point out that government
spending is still under tight control and the non-oil economy
may still be contracting.
    Capital expenditure on large projects has been cut sharply.
A U.S. Embassy report on Saudi Arabia published just before the
budget said: "While industrialisation has continued to be one of
the government's highest priorities, the recession, the
payments problem and the lack of financing have reduced Saudi
and foreign investor interest in industry."
    It is the lack of fresh investment that is expected to be a
major issue among the businessmen gathered here.
    Official figures show the number of new licences for
industrial ventures fell 24 pct in the six months to March
1986, compared with the same period in 1985.
    Lending by the Saudi Industrial Development Fund, a major
source of industry backing, has fallen steadily since 1983.
    Trading companies have also been hit, some caught with huge
inventories of construction equipment as recession bit.
    Some firms laid off workers and cut bloated inventories.
Others have effectively been liquidated. A few have reached
agreement with bankers to extend debt repayments.
    The latest rescheduling is for the shipping-to-hotels
conglomerate REDEC. Its negotiators have just initialled a
draft accord to restructure payments on 1.3 billion riyals of
bank debt.
    Bankers and businessmen said the conference was also likely
to discuss the apparent reluctance of U.S. And British firms to
step up investment in the kingdom.
    A British government delegation has just left Riyadh after
holding preliminary talks on ways of offsetting the huge Saudi
outlay on a defence contract to supply 132 fighter aircraft
worth five billion stg.

oil in the second week of March -- 1.8 mln bpd below its
ceiling -- largely because of pipeline problems in Turkey and
Ecuador, the Middle East Economic Survey (MEES) estimated.
    A landslide breached Iraq's one mln bpd pipeline through
Turkey on March 6 for a week, and earthquakes in Ecuador have
shut down its export pipeline for four to five months. Ecuador
has an OPEC quota of 210,000 bpd.
    MEES put Saudi Arabian output at 2.9 mln bpd in the first
week of March and 3.1 mln bpd in the second, in addition to
output from the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
    MEES said Saudi Arabia was pumping more than 300,000 bpd of
its total production into floating storage.
    Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazer told Reuters and the
television news agency Visnews yesterday that Saudi output,
including Neutral Zone production, was around three mln bpd.
    The Cyprus-based newsletter also said authoritative Libyan
oil sources said Libya was producing 850,000 bpd, compared with
its 948,000 bpd quota, and that actual liftings are much lower
than that.
    It said one major Libyan equity producer had partially
stopped lifting its 55,000 bpd equity entitlement for March
because Libya was insisting on official prices, but is still
lifting 40,000 bpd of debt crude at official prices and a
further 25,000 bpd of "purchase crude."
    It said small equity producers, with entitlements of only
2,000 to 3,000 bpd, had also told Tripoli they could not lift
at official prices.
    MEES said Iraq had sent a telex to OPEC and member
countries calling for the formation of a committee to study
what it said were inequalities in marketing potential among
various members.
    The newsletter said the Iraqi letter indicated Baghdad was
having difficulty selling crude at official prices.
    The Iraqi telex pointed out that some member countries
export substantial volumes of oil that are not subject to OPEC
price regulations -- exports of refined products, equity crude
on which the margins are equivalent to covert discounts and
"other forms of hydrocarbons" which are marketed in package deals
with crude oil.

Ecuador would honour its debt when it had the capacity to make
payments, but said foreign banks had calculated oil would have
to be 25 dlrs a barrel for Ecuador to meet its commitments.
    Ecuador said on Friday that last week's earthquake was
forcing it to reaffirm an earlier decision -- based on the
slide in world oil prices -- to suspend debt payments to
private foreign banks, which hold two-thirds of its 8.16
billion dlr foreign debt.
    "All legitimate debt is a commitment of honour," the
president said during a visit to the quake zone. "A government
as a sovereign entity has dignity and prestige to maintain."
    Private foreign banks and the World Bank had calculated oil
would have to be at least 25 dlrs a barrel for Quito to be able
to meet its commitments, Febres Cordero said.
    He added that Ecuadorean crude was now selling for 15 to 17
dlrs a barrel after having been sold for many months at 12 dlrs
a barrel and as low as seven dlrs before that.
    Meanwhile, Ecuador announced an austerity program and a
price freeze on key consumer goods as a result of the
earthquake, which killed at least 300 people.
    Presidency Minister Patricio Quevedo said the budget would
be cut by five to 10 pct, government hiring would be frozen and
salaries of top officials, including the president and cabinet,
would be reduced.
    He also said a price freeze would be imposed on 20 basic
consumer items, mainly food staples, while the price of
gasoline would rise by between 69 and 80 pct and bus fares
would rise by 20 pct. Gasoline supplies would also be limited.

mln dlr loan for Ecuador last year to pre-finance oil exports,
wants to adjust the terms of the facility to help the country
recover from a devastating earthquake, bankers said.
    But the French bank's plan, which would effectively
postpone repayment of about 30 mln dlrs of the loan for several
months, is running into stiff resistance from many of the 52
members of the loan syndicate.
    The pipeline that carries all Ecuador's oil exports was
ruptured in the March 5 tremor and will take some five months
to repair at a cost of about 150 mln dlrs to repair.
    President Leon Febres Cordero on Friday estimated total
damages caused by the quake at one billion dlrs and said that
Ecuador as a result would maintain January's suspension of
interest payments on its foreign commercial bank debt.
    Payments were halted in January because of the drop in the
price of oil, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of Ecuador's
export earnings and 60 pct of government revenue.
    Although sympathetic to Ecuador's plight, many banks in the
Paribas facility feel that emergency financial relief is a job
for international financial organizations and not for
commercial banks, bankers said.
    The 18-month oil-financing facility, which was signed last
October 28, is one of the few purely voluntary credits for a
Latin American nation since the region's debt crisis erupted in
August 1982.
    Because it was a voluntary deal, many bankers feel strongly
that the orginal terms must be adhered to. Otherwise, they
fear, the gradual re-establishment of normal market conditions
for Latin borrowers will be set back.
    "There's a lot of reluctance by the other banks. They feel
it's a different facility, and so any kind of suggestion of a
restructuring would look bad," one banker commented.

U.S. Will be dependent on oil from the middle east into the
next century and must take steps to reduce its vulnerability,
the New York Times said.
    The newspaper said the inter-agency government study found
a serious oil-dependency problem due to steadily falling
domestic production and rising demand for imported oil.
    The study concluded that by 1995 the U.S. Will be relying
on foreign countries for 50 pct of its oil, more than the peak
of 48 pct reached in 1977 and far above the 33 pct rate during
the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo.
    The U.S. Now imports about 38 pct of its oil needs, up from
27 pct a year ago, the New York Times said.
    It said recommendations sent to the White House by Energy
Secretary John Harrington include financial incentives to raise
domestic oil production by one mln barrels a day from the
current 8.4 mln barrels.
    The newspaper said the administration has placed increased
emphasis on stockpiling oil reserves. It said the view now held
is that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to be tapped in times
of shortages, should be increased by 100,000 barrels a day,
rather than 35,000 as called for in the 1988 budget.
   The newspaper said Harrington may propose restoring the
depletion allowance to major producers.
    "The administration also plans to renew its efforts to
...Repeal the windfall profits tax, remove bars to drilling on
the outer continental shelf and repeal the law that limits the
use of natural gas in industrial and utility boilers," it added.
    The New York Times quoted Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma
as saying the study greatly underestimated potential U.S.
Demand for imported oil in the next decade and overestimated
the amount of domestic oil which would be produced.

    Prices of oil stocks rose sharply today in response to

company, said in a published interview today that it was
reviewing its worldwide refinery operations and might decide to
close on of its french refineries.
    Lee R. Raymond, Exxon's new president, singled out the
possibility of a closure of one of Exxon's refineries in France
during the interview.
    An Exxon spokeswoman confirmed that Raymond had
specifically mentioned refineries in France but said that no
specific refinery had been named. She also said that all of
Exxon's opertations were under constant review.
    Exxon currently has two refineries in France, FOS in the
mediterranean with a capcity of 175,000 barrels per day and
Port Jerome west of paris with a similar capacity.
    Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, an influential trade
journal, said, in its current issue, that they understood that
Exxon was looking at the possibility of refinery closures in
Antwerp, Southern France or possibly Italy.
    Paul Mlotok, oil analyst with Salomon Brothers inc said
that with the closures Exxon made in 1986 in Europe and the
improvement in the European refining situation, its future
profits there should be good.
    "Exxon and other major oil companies have closed a bunch of
refineries in Europe, upgraded the rest and shaken many of the
indepedents out of the market. Now with demand for products
rising and efficient operations, Exxon should show superior
earnings," Mlotok said.
    "Just after Royal Dutch <RD>, they are seen as one of the
highest grade refiners in Europe," he added.
    Industry sources said that the oil companies were likely to
feel greater pressure on their operations in Southern Europe
where competition from the OPEC countries is increasing as
these producers move further into downstream operations.
    PIW said that refiners in the Mediterranean can expect
increased shipments from Saudi Arabia and other OPEC export
refineries.
    PIW said "sales from Libya, Algeria and elsewhere are
expected to reclaim markets lost to Italian and other European
refiners as a result of the abundance of cheap netback oil last
year."

producers, announced today, are aimed at encouraging
developments in the North Sea to go ahead and boost
opportunities for the offshore supplies industry, the Inland
Revenue said in a post-budget statement.
    Earlier, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson announced
in his annual budget to Parliament that from today, companies
will be allowed to offset up to 10 pct of qualifying
development expenditure on certain future oil fields against
Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT).
    To date, full relief was allowed for expenditure on an
individual field itself, when its income stream began, but was
not immediately available against other development
expenditure, the statement said.
    The new relief will apply to fields outside the southern
basin for which development
consent is first given on or after today, and will improve the
post-tax economics of new developments and encourage companies
to proceed with project which might have been delayed, it said.
    Lawson also announced that he would henceforth allow
certain expenditure on oil related research which does not at
present qualify for PRT relief to be offset against PRT
liability.
    This means oil-related expenditure in the U.K. Or on the
U.K. Continental shelf, which has not become allowable in a
particular field within three years of being incurred, to be
allowed against PRT liability in any oil field, the Inland
Revenue said.
    This brings the scope of PRT relief for research costs more
in line with corporation tax relief measures, and is planned to
encourage general research into ways of reducing field
development costs, it said.
    In due course, the industry should benefit by over 100 mln
stg a year, it calculated.
    The Inland Revenue statement also included other technical
measures that Lawson did not comment on in his budget speech.
    These included measures to allow companies to balance their
shares of PRT-exempt oil allowances through reallocation in two
past periods of allowance utilisation.
    Tidier rules on incorrectly allowed PRT expenditure reliefs
were announced, while there were also ammendments on rules on
corporation tax and Advance Corporation Tax relating to the
so-called "ring fence" of activities in the U.K. And its
continental shelf. The Finance Bill will have provisions for
the implementation of measures announced in November, it said.
    Gareth Lewis Davies, a North Sea expert with stockbrokers
Wood Mackenzie and Co Inc in Edinburgh, thought the two reliefs
on PRT would help the depressed offshore industry.
    He said the 10 pct cross field allowance relief would
favour chances that development of smaller North Sea fields
such Osprey, Don and Arbroath would be brought forward.
    Early development of the larger Miller and Bruce oil fields
might also be encouraged, he said.
    Lewis Davies said the measure might also aid the offshore
construction industry, which suffered a huge amount of lay-offs
under the price slump of more than 50 pct last year.
    He pointed out that the relief only applies to the
development of new fields outside the Southern Basin.
    This means more jobs could be created, as the fields in the
central and northern sectors of the North Sea are deeper than
in the south and thus have greater capital and labour
requirements as the waters are deeper than in the south.
    He said the PRT relief for certain research expenditure
would help fundamental research in the oil industry, although
the benefits of this research would not be seen for several
year.

that growing U.S. reliance on foreign oil into the year 2000
could have potentially damaging implications for national
security.
    The Energy Department study discusses several options to
curb reliance on foreign oil, but makes no recommendations.
    President Reagan and most Congressmen have previously ruled
out a tax on foreign oil as a way to curb imports and to help
the depressed domestic oil industry.
    Energy Secretary John Herrington said in a statement that
"although we have made gains in energy security in the last six
years, this report shows that there is justification for
national concern both over declining competitiveness of our
domestic oil and gas industry and over rising oil imports."
    The report said imports last year were 33 pct of U.S.
consumption and by the mid-1990s could rise to 50 pct.
    Among the report's options to ease U.S. reliance on foreign
oil are several already advocated by the Reagan Administration.
    President Reagan ordered the study last September, citing a
determination that the country never again become captive to a
foreign oil cartel, referring to the OPEC-led oil shortages and
sharp prices increases of the 1970s.
    The report said an import fee would raise prices and help
make it economical for U.S. oil firms to find and produce new
oil, as well as to cut imports, but on the whole the tax would
depress the nation's economy.

united states will make no difference to champlin petroleum
corp's joint venture agreement signed today with petroleos de
venezuela (pdvsa), champlin chairman william adams said.
    "this was an aspect which was discussed at length during the
negotiations, but we can say our contract covers all
eventualities in this regard," he told reuters during the
signing ceremony here.
    Venezuela's energy and mines minister arturo hernandez
grisanti earlier described the agreement, under which pdvsa
buys 50 pct of champlin's corpus christi refinery, as "one more
step in the maturation and presence of our oil industry in
world markets."
   union pacific chairman william cook said the agreement will
be beneficial to both sides, combining a secure source of
supply with a modern refinery and access to markets.
    "we are looking to a long-term relationship, and at a time
of protectionist tendencies in the U.S. Congress there are
clear benefits to both sides," he said.
    Adams said pdvsa crude would remain competitive even with
an oil import fee because champlin had invested heavily over
the years in adapingthe texas refinery to process venezuelan
heavy crudes with coking and hydro-treating facilities and
obtain a competitive product yield.
    "therefore while the danger of an oil import fee has been a
consideration in the negotiations, and it remains to be seen
what such a fee would represent, we do not foresee any impact
on today's agreement," adams said.
    He said the refinery could run crude as heavy as
venezuela's bolivar coastal field (bcf) 17 api without any
difficultiesand would probably move over time to a heavier diet
to take advantage of bigger margins.
    The refinery has a capacity to process up to 110,000 bpd of
venezuelan high sulphur content heavy crude, with an 80-85 pct
yield of white products.

head off increasing U.S. dependence on foreign oil.
    He said also at a news conference that he would recommend
to the White House that the fill rate of the Strategic

    The oil reserve fill rate capacity is 100,000 barrels a

that growing U.S. reliance on foreign oil into the year 2000
could have potentially damaging implications for national
security.
    The Energy Department study discusses several options to
curb reliance on foreign oil, but makes no recommendations.
    President Reagan and most Congressmen have previously ruled
out a tax on foreign oil as a way to curb imports and to help
the depressed domestic oil industry.
    Energy Secretary John Herrington said in a statement that
"although we have made gains in energy security in the last six
years, this report shows that there is justification for
national concern both over declining competitiveness of our
domestic oil and gas industry and over rising oil imports."
    The report said imports last year were 33 pct of U.S.
consumption and by the mid-1990s could rise to 50 pct.
    Among the report's options to ease U.S. reliance on foreign
oil are several already advocated by the Reagan Administration.
    President Reagan ordered the study last September, citing a
determination that the country never again become captive to a
foreign oil cartel, referring to the OPEC-led oil shortages and
sharp prices increases of the 1970s.
    The report said an import fee would raise prices and help
make it economical for U.S. oil firms to find and produce new
oil, as well as to cut imports, but on the whole the tax would
depress the nation's economy.
    The study was outlined in a New York Times report today.

be set around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs a barrel, OAPEC
Assistant General Secretary Abdelaziz Al-Wattari said today.
    In a speech to a European Community (EC)/OAPEC/OPEC seminar
in Luxembourg released here, Al-Wattari said: "OPEC believes
...The world energy trade should be kept without restrictions
and should be built around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs."
    But he warned that defense of the 18 dlr a barrel level had
caused hardship for OPEC countries, who had been forced to
curtail production, and he warned that such cutbacks by OPEC
states could not be sustained in some cases.
    "For OPEC to stabilize the world oil price at what is now
considered the optimal level of 18 dlrs a barrel, its member
countries have had to undergo severe hardship in curtailing
production," Al-Wattari said.
    "Such cutbacks ... Cannot, in certain cases, be sustained,"
Al-Wattari said. As well as financial and marketing pressures,
some states depended on associated gas output for domestic use
and oil cutbacks had left insufficient gas supplies, he added.
    Al-Wattari noted that total OPEC output was below the
organization's agreed ceiling for all member countries in
February, although this had meant sacrifices.
    The effect of these sacrifices meant that market stability,
though restored to a good level, was still under pressure,
Al-Wattari said. "A lasting stability in the world market
requires a wider scope of international cooperation," he added.
    He said some non-OPEC oil producing countries had shown a
political willingness after 1986 to cooperate with OPEC.
    But although cutbacks announced by these states were
politically significant and welcomed by OPEC, they were
insufficient in terms of volume, he added. "The overall majority
of non-OPEC producers have not responded sufficiently to OPEC's
calls for supply regulation," he said.
    Al-Wattari said an 18 dlr a barrel price was optimal as it
allowed investment in the oil industry outside OPEC to
continue, while not generating excessive cash flow for
otherwise unviable high-cost areas outside OPEC. Such a price
would no longer encourage protectionist measures, he added.
    Fadhil Al-Chalabi, OPEC Deputy Secretary General, also
addressing the seminar, added that discipline was still needed
to prevent violent fluctuations in the oil market.
    Cooperation between Arab states and Europe was advantageous
for both sides, Al-Chalabi said, adding he hoped cooperation
would ultimately lead to full-fledged Euro-Arab dialogue.

    "We have yet to finalize details on how the compensation

requires its clients to sign final destination clauses to

saying Venezuela will export the oil on Ecuador's account and
remit the revenues to Quito. Ecuador would pay back the oil at

never allows third parties to trade its oil.

revenues will fall to four billion stg in the fiscal year
1987/88, from 4.75 billion in 1986/87 and 11.5 billion in
1985/86.
    The forecast came in the Treasury's Financial Statement and
Budget Report issued after the Chancellor of the Exchequer
Nigel Lawson's annual budget statement to parliament.
    The government is assuming the price of oil will average 15
dlrs a barrel, in line with its earlier forecasts, and its oil
revenue calculation is based on an exchange rate remaining
close to current levels, the Treasury document said.
    The Treasury said the 1987/88 oil revenue shortfall will
reflect the oil price fall of 1986, as North Sea corporation
tax is paid after a time lag.
    The statement calculated that a one dlr a barrel difference
in oil prices this year will change revenue by about 350 mln
stg for the current fiscal year, and 400 mln stg in a full
year.
    Oil production is forecast to fall slightly in 1987,
according to the statement. A change in one mln tonnes in
production would alter revenue by about 45 mln stg in 1987/88
and 50 mln stg in a full year, it added.
    Total general government receipts for 1986/87 are now
estimated to be 159.2 billion stg, 2.75 billion more than the
1986 Budget forecasts and above the Autumn Statement forecasts,
despite a shortfall of 1.25 billlion in oil receipts.
    Additional non-North Sea corporation tax of 1.75 billion
stg and VAT of 750 mln stg account for the bulk of the
overshoot.
    Total general government receipts were forecast to rise to
168.8 billion stg in fiscal 1987/88, and among the main items,
besides diminishing oil revenues, were projected income tax of
40 billion stg, up from 38.4 billion in the current year.
    Non-North Sea corporation tax is forecast to bring in 13.5
billion stg in 1987/88, after the revised 11.2 billion in
1986/87, and VAT revenue should amount to 23.3 billion,
compared with upwardly revised estimated 21.5 billion this
fiscal year.
    The general government expenditure for the coming fiscal
year is expected to total 173.5 billion stg, up from a revised
164.9 billion in the current year.
    A repayment of 800 mln on public corporations' market and
overseas borrowings is forecast to bring the total Public
Sector Borrowing Requirement down to 3.9 billion stg in
1987/88, from this year's revised 4.1 billion, the Treasury
said.

will cut oil production to 420,000 barrels per day (bpd) from
May 1, trade sources said.
    Malaysia cut its 510,000 bpd target output by 10 pct last
September to support Opec moves to boost prices, and the latest
cut would reduce output by 17.5 pct from 1986's target level.
    Petronas said in February that Malaysia would maintain its
10 pct production cutback until mid-1987.
    However, the Finance Ministry said in its annual report
that Malaysia's crude oil output was expected to rise to an
average 510,000 bpd in 1987.
    The ministry's forecast assumed average 1987 crude prices
at 13 dlrs/barrel (bbl), but prices have risen enough to permit
further production cutbacks, the sources said.
    Malaysia's benchmark Tapis blend fetched above 18 dlrs/bbl
this year against a low of 10.50 dlrs/bbl in July, they said.
    Traders said further reductions by Malaysia would add to
the tight spot availabilities of Asian grades caused by reduced
Indonesian and Chinese crude output.
    The cutback will also help Malaysia maintain prices, as
there is concern some buyers want to reduce term purchases due
to the availability of cheaper alternatives, the sources said.
    In addition to term sales, Petronas has been offering two
to three 400,000 bbl spot cargoes of Malaysian crude each month

new realism ushered in by austerity, could lift Saudi Arabia's
economy after five years of falling revenue and growing budget
deficits, bankers and diplomats said.
    The months ahead will prove critical as the government
attempts a balancing act between defending higher oil prices
and fostering recovery through a bigger role for the private
sector.
    Economists said oil earnings could recover this year to
about 20 billion dlrs and nominal gross domestic product could
grow by about three pct, the first rise since 1982.
    But the economists said this will be possible only if the
Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) succeeds
in defending world oil prices and if Saudi Arabia is not forced
to curtail output for too long.
    Saudi Arabia is now keeping production down to defend
OPEC's newly-established 18 dlr a barrel benchmark price.
    Oil Minister Hisham Nazer told Reuters output is running at
about three mln barrels per day (bpd), well down on Saudi
Arabia's OPEC quota of 4.13 mln set for the first half of 1987.
    King Fahd has stamped his personal authority on OPEC's
new-found determination to defend prices in a move Western
diplomats believe underlines the kingdom's need to secure a
stable source of income for its economy.
    Saudi Arabia, still the world's largest oil exporter, is a
hugely wealthy country. But the past five years of declining
revenue have taken their toll. Economists estimate gross
domestic product fell 10 pct last year and 8.6 pct in 1985.
    Oil revenue last year, when prices briefly dipped below 10
dlrs per barrel, probably totalled no more than 17.5 billion
dlrs, compared to a peak 101.8 billion in 1981.
    "Austerity is still the watchword, but Saudi Arabia will not
be allowed to dip further into recession ... The Saudis can
afford to draw down reserves temporarily to offset the worst
effects," a diplomat said.
    In the short-term, the kingdom can lessen the impact of
lower oil revenues and a gaping budget deficit by drawing on
foreign reserves, still put at around 100 billion dlrs.
    But such a policy cannot be pursued indefinitely. Bankers
and diplomats said it would amount to fiscal recklessness in
the longer term.
    It also increases the dominance of the public sector at a
time when the government is publicly urging private enterprise
to take over the lead role in the economy.
    Bankers and diplomats said the government is well aware of
the risks attached to this policy but is determined to "tough it
out" on the oil front even if that means a short-term depletion
of reserves.
    The 1987 budget deficit is targetted at a huge 52.7 billion
riyals or 31 pct of total outlay. The budget explicitly
recognises the need to draw down reserves while foreign
borrowing has been ruled out.
    Commerce Minister Suleiman Abdulaziz al-Salim told Saudi
businessmen this week the government had carefully considered
the need to stimulate the economy when drawing up its budget
plans late last year.
    "It therefore took the bold step of withdrawing more than 50
billion riyals from its reserves and pumping it into the
economy," he said.
    Reserves were built up during the late 1970's and early
1980's when Saudi Arabia's breakneck pace of construction and
tales of high spending became legendary.
    The shrinking economy has wrought huge changes in the
fabric of the Kingdom's private sector where poor management
had gone unpunished in the easy days of the oil boom.
    Modern techniques of cost control have been introduced,
markets expanded and outsized labour forces and inventories cut
back. The expatriate workforce has fallen sharply.
    The number of new bankruptcies appears to be declining but
Saudi banks, hit hard by non-performing loans to the corporate
sector, have become highly selective in extending new credit.
    Government moves to encourage lending and investigate
company complaints about late public sector contract payments
could boost confidence but recession has slowed the nation's
industrialisation program and discouraged foreign investment.
    Private wealth is still very high and banks report more and
more cash being placed on deposit.
    As Saudi Arabia attempts to shift the weight of economic
development from the public to the private sector, one of the
biggest tasks will be to convince businessmen to channel
personal savings into industrial projects within the kingdom
and refrain from the temptation to invest abroad.

Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) announced by U.K. Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawson this week will favour smaller non-PRT
paying fields, according to stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co.
    The cross field allowance offsets up to 10 pct of
qualifying spending on a new oil field against PRT liability of
other fields. It is restricted to new offshore developments
outside the southern basin and yet to gain Annex B approval.
    A report by the stockbrokers said that on a new field not
paying PRT due to its small size, the relief would directly
benefit in PRT saving on an existing field.
    "The cross field allowance will mainly benefit participators
in those fields which have no PRT liability," the report said,
adding that the timing of development of such fields may be
advanced.
    The government would in effect be subsidising these
developments at 7.5 pct of capital expenditure before
corporation tax, the report said.
    On fields likely to pay PRT in the future, the benefit is
of timing. Although liabilities on other existing fields will
be reduced immediately, liabilities on larger new fields will
rise in the future due to the loss of offsets, it said.
    In a study on probable fields, the report said that when
the rates of return are examined, the rise for a PRT-paying
field such as Miller, the largest undeveloped oil field in the
U.K. North Sea, is from 18.7 to 19 pct, while the rise for a
small non-PRT paying field such as Kittiwake is 15.9 to 17.9
pct.
    The report added that in fields which pay PRT, there will
be a cost in being able to have this early relief. Not only
will these costs be unavailable for offset against the field's
future profits, but uplift of some 35 pct on these costs will
be lost.
    Thus, a saving of PRT of 100 when field development starts
will have to be matched by a rise in PRT of 135 at a later
time.

expected to press Indonesia, the Third World's sixth largest
debtor, to maintain the momentum of economic policy changes to
tackle the slump in its oil revenues, western diplomats said.
    Conable, who flew to Indonesia yesterday from Tokyo, will
meet with President Suharto and senior economic ministers.
    He said on arrival that the economy of South-East Asia's
largest nation was being managed well, but the slump in world
oil prices called for major policy adjustments.
    Today the World Bank chief will visit Bank-funded projects
in the eastern section of Java, Indonesia's most populous
island. He will see Suharto on Tuesday after a day of detailed
discussions with ministers tomorrow.
    Indonesia, the only Asian member of OPEC, has been severely
hit by last year's crash in oil prices, which cut its oil and
gas revenues in half.
    Japan's state Export-Import Bank last month agreed to
provide around 900 mln dlrs in untied credits to help Indonesia
pay for its share of 21 World Bank development projects.
    Indonesia, a country of 168 mln people, has responded to
the oil slump by cutting spending, devaluing its currency by 31
pct, and trying to boost exports, while using foreign loans to
bridge its deficit.
    Diplomats said that Conable was expected to press Suharto
and leading economic ministers to maintain the pace of policy
change, particularly in dismantling Indonesia's high-cost
protected economy.
    "Oil prices, the debt crisis, the world recession, all call
for major policy adjustments and external support," Conable said
in his arrival statement.
    But with Indonesia facing parliamentary elections next
month, he is likely to avoid anything which would imply that
the Bank is demanding specific changes.
    "We believe there has been wise leadership here and the
economy is being very well managed," Conable told reporters at
Jakarta airport.
    Indonesia has official and private overseas debts totalling
37 billion dlrs, according to the Bank, which makes it the
Third World's sixth biggest debtor. It has received 10.7
billion dlrs from the World Bank since 1968.
    Conable did not spell out what further changes he would
like to see. Last month the Bank endorsed economic changes
already introduced by Indonesia, but implied it wanted more.
    Giving a 300 mln dlr loan in balance of payments support,
the Bank said it will monitor progress on implementation of the
government's trade reform measures, and supported its
determination to promote efficiency and longer-term growth.
    Indonesia has introduced a series of measures since last
May to boost non-oil exports, liberalise trade and encourage
outside investment.
    Suharto has also ordered a government committee to look
into which of Indonesia's 215 state-run companies could be
sold.
    But in a report last month, the U.S. Embassy said the
government appeared divided over how far to take its reforms.
    Western analysts say that in particular the government is
unsure how far to go with dismantling Indonesia's high-cost
monopolies, which control core areas of the economy.
    Central bank governor Arifin Siregar said this week that
Indonesia faced very limited economic choices.
    It could not spend its way out of trouble because this
would increase the balance of payments deficit and domestic
inflation.
     He said the main objective was to raise exports outside
the oil and natural gas sector.
    Indonesia's current account deficit is projected by the
government to fall to 2.64 billion dlrs in the coming financial
year which starts on April 1, from an estimated 4.1 billion in
1986/87.

 ]]></BODY><BODY><![CDATA[The government's
over-reliance on revenue from crude oil is adversely affecting
Australia's economic performance, Australian Petroleum
Exploration Association (APEA) chairman Dennis Benbow said.
    Over one-third of Australia's indirect tax income is
derived from oil at a time of falling domestic output and weak
crude prices, he told the APEA annual conference here.
    This dependence on oil-generated revenue distorts the
country's economic performance directly by acting as a
disincentive to new exploration and indirectly by affecting
trading competitiveness through high energy costs, he said.
    Australia's medium-term liquid fuel self-sufficiency
position is posing a major economic threat, yet the
government's response has been to load new tax burdens on the
oil industry, Benbow said.
    Domestic oil output from existing fields is expected to
fall to 280,000 barrels per day (bpd) in fiscal 1992/93 from
546,000 bpd in 1985/86, reflecting mainly the decline of the
Bass Strait fields, he said.
    Bass Strait reserves are now two-thirds depleted, with the
three largest fields 80 pct depleted, he said.
    By 1992/93, Bass Strait output is expected to be just over
half the 1985/86 level, assuming a number of so far undeveloped
fields are brought on stream and enhanced recovery from
existing fields goes ahead, Benbow said.
    Government projections of output from as yet undiscovered
fields range from 40,000 to 130,000 bpd, he said.
    Australian liquid fuel demand is forecast to rise to
680,000 bpd in 1992/93 from 565,000 in 1985/86, implying a
crude oil gap of between 270,000 and 360,000 bpd in five years
time, he said.
    At present world oil prices and the current value of the
Australian dollar, annual oil imports in 1992/93 would cost
between 3.2 billion and 3.6 billion dlrs, Benbow said.
    Despite intensive exploration in the early 1980's, the
addition to reserves has been inadequate, he said.
    For example, the 409 mln barrels discovered in the five
years 1980-84 represent about two years' consumption, he said.
    He called on the government to review its tax policies to
restore incentive to exploration.

should prepare for an inevitable significant increase in the
price of oil as non-Middle East supplies diminish, Exxon Corp
<XON> director and senior vice-president Donald McIvor said.
    Policymakers must also face up to the reality that the bulk
of world oil reserves lies in the Middle East, he said in a
speech prepared for delivery to the Australian Petroleum
Exploration Association (APEA) annual conference.
    It appears ever more likely that new discoveries elsewhere
will not change this fact, he said.
    McIvor said 37 of the world's 30,000 oil fields contain
about 35 pct of all oil ever discovered.
    Only 11 of these 37 super-giant fields lie outside the
Middle East and only five of the 37 have been discovered in the
last 20 years, three of them in the Middle East, he said.
    He also said that since 1970, the world has been consuming
20 to 25 billion barrels a year while making discoveries at the
rate of only 10 to 15 billion barrels a year.
    More than half of remaining proved reserves are in the
Middle East, he said.
    McIvor said it was important to continue to search for oil
outside the Middle East because each addition contributes to a
diversity of supply desirable for global political and economic
stability.
    "It is important to enhance the likelihood of home-country
discoveries with measures such as non-discriminatory and stable
taxation, and minimum regulation, together with opening up of
acreage for exploration," he said.
    Increasing reliance on the Middle East will also boost the
incentive to use natural gas and synthetic sources of
petroleum, he added.

point reduction in the Australian government's maximum crude
oil levy on old oil would stabilize Bass Straits oil output,
resources analyst Ian Story said here.
    A reduction to 70 pct from 80 pct would enable Bass Strait
output to be maintained at the current rate of 420,000 barrels
per day (BPD) for the next year rather than falling to 380,000
BPD in 1987/88, he told the Australian Petroleum Exploration
Association annual conference.
    Story is an analyst with and a director of Sydney
stockbroker Meares and Philips Ltd.
    Windfall profits taxes on Bass Strait crude are no longer
appropriate in the current economic climate, Story said.
    The maximum 80 pct levy on old oil -- that discovered
before September 1975 -- is now forcing the Broken Hill Pty Co
Ltd <BRKN.S>/Exxon Corp <XON> partnership to shut-in
production, accelerating the decline in output and reducing
government revenue, he said.
    He said the producer return per barrel at a price of 30
Australian dlrs a barrel would rise to 2.07 dlrs from 0.80 dlrs
if the levy was cut to 70 pct.
    "The economics at an 80 pct levy are simply not attractive
at oil prices below 30 dlrs," Story said.
    Cutting the maximum levy rate to 70 pct would create higher
levels of self-sufficiency, increase government revenue, boost
exports and provide incentives for exploration and development,
he said.
    The government is currently reviewing the oil tax
structure.

    "An optimal tariff would be one implemented only if the

oil tax strategy is probably best tackled in terms of a
targeted rather than broadly-based approach, Federal Resources
and Energy Minister Gareth Evans told a meeting here.
    He told the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association
(APEA) annual conference there was a prospect of developing a
package that would recognise the government's economic
priorities while also meeting some of the industry's concerns.
    Evans was referring to a nearly completed government review
of oil taxation.
    Evans said there were plenty of examples where targeted
approaches to oil industry taxation had produced good results
in recent years.
    These include the reduction in the top marginal crude
excise rate on 'old' Bass Strait oil found before September
1975 to 80 pct from 87 pct, and the waiver of excise on onshore
oil announced last September, he said.
    The industry, through the APEA, has been calling for the
elimination of secondary taxation on oil in order to boost
incentives for prospecting against a background of weak prices
and Australia's relatively low exploration levels.
    "While nobody wants to add further unnecessary complexity to
an already complex taxation regime, I am inclined to favour
these kinds of tailored approaches ahead of sweeping changes,
which leave (government) revenue much reduced and may still
leave a lot of uncertainty as to what individual companies are
going to do in major areas," Evans said.
    He said the government did not intend to change its
resource rent taxation (RRT) legislation, now before
parliament, in response to industry calls to allow all
exploration expenditure in a given area to be deductible.
    As previously reported, RRT is a tax of 40 pct limited to
highly prospective offshore areas, based on profits after a
certain rate of return has been achieved for individual
projects.
    APEA has said it is not a true profit-based tax because
exploration deductibility is limited to successful projects.
    Evans said the decision not to change RRT was based more
than anything on the government's desire to ensure the
certainty and stability of the new regime, adding that major
investments have already been planned on the existing ground
rules.

world oil prices, but said further deregulation of its
protected economy was needed.
    Speaking to reporters after talks with President Suharto,
he said he expected Jakarta to do more to liberalise the
economy and deregulate trade policy.
    Indonesia, hurt by the fall in oil prices last year which
cut the value of its crude exports in half, is the Third
World's sixth largest debtor. It has received 10.7 billion dlrs
from the World Bank in the past 20 years.
    Conable said the World Bank, which granted Indonesia a 300

prepared to back Jakarta in taking the right steps to adjust to
lower oil and primary commodity prices.
    "We are prepared to support those steps which we believe are
consistent with the development of the Indonesian economy," he
said.
    He said Jakarta's willingness to move quickly after last
year's collapse in oil price saved Indonesia from some of the
difficulties now faced by other countries.
    Indonesia devalued its currency by 31 pct against the
dollar in September to avoid a balance of payments crisis, and
has announced a series of measures since May intended to
stimulate exports, encourage foreign investment and revitalise
the economy.
    However, key monopolies in areas like steel and plastics
and high tariff barriers remain in place.
    Conable arrived in Indonesia on Saturday and has since met

Australian Petroleum Exploration Association (APEA) said it
will press on with its campaign for major improvements to
Australia's petroleum taxation structure.
    The council said in a statement the industry was bitterly
disappointed by the Australian government's position on
taxation, as presented in a speech by Resources and Energy
Minister Gareth Evans to the APEA conference.
    As earlier reported, Evans said he was inclined to target
any tax changes rather than take a broad-based approach to
secondary taxation of petroleum.
    APEA had expected the government to make positive responses
to detailed industry submissions seeking the removal of
existing secondary tax disincentives to exploration and
development, the council said.
    It said it plans to reply in detail to issues raised by
Evans, but its immediate concern was the decision to proceed
with the current resource rental tax (RRT) legislation.
    Evans told the conference the government did not plan to
accept industry pleas for changes in the legislation to allow
deductibility of unsuccessful exploration expenditure.
    "The government's unwillingness to allow the deduction of
unsuccessful exploration expenditure within the whole offshore
area in which RRT applies negates any claim that the tax is
profit based," the APEA council said.
    The government missed a major opportunity to persuade oil
exploration companies that it had realistic answers to the
industry's concerns, despite its recognition of the industry's
problems, the council said.
    The industry has called for the end of all discriminatory
secondary taxation of petroleum, citing them as major
disincentives at a time of low oil prices.

a 27.5 pct annual depletion allowance was "heavy and strong"
largely because of some fears that the U.S. oil industry could
eventually become as dependent on federal subsidies as the
agriculture industry.
    Herrington's proposed tax incentives for the oil industry
were issued last week after the Department of Energy released a
comprehensive report finding U.S. national security could be
jeopardized by rising oil imports.
    In response to a question from Mitchell Energy and
Development Corp <MND> chairman, George Mitchell, Herrington
said the report did not definitively rule out an oil import
tarrif. "We intend to keep that debate open," Herrington said.
    However, following his speech, Herrington told Reuters that
the new report shows an oil import fee "is not economical."
    Herrington said, for example, a 10 dlr per barrel tariff on
oil imports would cause the nation's gross national product to
drop by as much as 32 billion dlrs.
    Herrington also said he believed President Reagan, who
requested the comprehensive national security study, was
committed to some action to help the ailing U.S. oil industry.
    "I'm quite confident he understands the problems and is
prepared to do something about it," Herrington said.

Secretary James Herrington's "outrageous" plan to restore an old
tax break for oil companies was both bad tax and energy policy.
    Rep. Pete Stark, a California Democrat and senior House
Ways and Means Committee member, said Herrington's plan for a
27.5 pct depletion allowance--which in effect is a special 27.5
pct tax deduction --would cost seven billion dlrs a year.
    "He must have missed the last two years of federal tax
reform by sleeping as soundly as Rip Van Winkle," Stark said.
    He said in a statement the oil industry already pays an

    Amoco has so far laid 7,100 km of seismic lines and sunk

oilfield in the Gulf, shut since an aerial attack last
November, will reopen when new anti-aircraft defences are
ready, and this could be in the next two months, oil industry
sources said.
    They said the Abu Dhabi government and Compagnie Francaise
des Petroles (Total) <TPN.PA>, whose Total Abu al-Bukhoosh
subsidiary owns 51 pct of the field, have agreed on the
reopening, but that a date has not been definitely fixed.
    Unidentified planes hit the field, 100 miles off Abu Dhabi,
last November 25.
    The raid killed eight workers and destroyed the main living
quarters and a bridge linking a wellhead to the main production
platform.
    Western diplomats in the region say Iran was responsible
but Tehran has blamed its Gulf War enemy Iraq.
    Abu al-Bukhoosh was producing 57,000 barrels per day (bpd)
at the time of the attack, but the sources said it would resume
at a maximum of half that level because of reduced staff and
the fact only four of five wellheads were now operable.
    The sources said only 80 personnel can be housed in
remaining accomodations, the sources said.
    Facilities being installed to protect the field include
aircraft detection equipment, anti-aircraft missiles, housing
for military personnel and helicopter landing pads, the sources
said.
    Abu Dhabi is the largest oil producer in the United Arab
Emirates, accounting for about 800,000 bpd of its total 1.15
mln bpd production, the sources said.
    They also said Iran was working to reopen its Sassan field,
part of the same reservoir as Abu al-Bukhoosh and located only
a few miles away. Sassan was heavily damaged by an Iraqi air
raid only 10 days before Abu al-Bukhoosh was attacked.

(PNG) provides the most exciting new prospect in the
Asia-Pacific region for oil production, energy analyst Fereidun
Fesharaki said here.
    The recent successful find at Iagifu is likely to put PNG
on the list of major oil exporters by the early 1990s, he told
the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association annual
conference.
    Fesharaki, leader of the Energy Program at the East-West
Center in Honolulu, Hawaii, was speaking on the Asia-Pacific
petroleum outlook.
    With domestic demand of around 12,000 barrels per day (bpd)
and prospects of production of over 100,000 bpd by late 1991,
PNG would become an Ecuador-level crude exporter, Fesharaki
said.
    The Iagifu wells in the Papuan Basin have recorded the best
oil flows in more than 60 years of exploration in PNG.
    The PNG government's Geological Survey in a paper
distributed at the conference estimates Iagifu reserves at
about 500 mln barrels.
    PNG enjoys the most liberal tax regime in the region with
no secondary taxes, Fesharaki said.
    "We expect a much larger oil search in Papua New Guinea, and
discovery of much larger volumes of oil, similar in quality to
(light) Bass Strait crude," Fesharaki said.
    There are also large pockets of high quality condensates to
be produced, notably in the Juha field near Iagifu which is
capable of producing 30,000 to 40,000 bpd, he said.
    But prices should be somewhat higher than the present
levels to justify development of the Juha field, he said.
    The PNG Geological Survey paper noted there are five large
prospective but little-explored sedimentary basins in PNG.

denied in an interview published in Saudi Arabia today that her
government's oil policy contributed to weakness in world oil
prices.
    She said the government was determined not to intervene to
influence production decisions by oil companies operating in
the North Sea.
    "We believe these must be a matter for the commercial
judgment of the oil companies," she told the Arabic language
daily al-Sharq al-Awsat in an interview coinciding with a visit
to London by King Fahd of Saudi Arabia.
    Thatcher said this policy had not contributed to the fall
in oil prices as North Sea production was now about the same as
in 1984 when prices were close to 30 dlrs a barrel.
    British production was on a plateau and was unlikely to
increase in the future, she said.
    "We naturally share the concern of Saudi Arabia and other
OPEC members about the harmful effects of oil market volatility
for both producer and consumer countries," Thatcher said.
    "On our part, we are careful to avoid any actions which
might add to such volatility."

will provide a 350 mln dlr oil industry aid package that
includes cash incentives designed to cover one-third of a
company's oil and gas exploration and development costs, Energy
Minister Marcel Masse announced.
    The aid program will inject about 350 mln dlrs a year into
the oil and gas industry and could lead to more than one
billion dlrs in new investment, Masse told a news conference.
    The program will affect drilling done anywhere in Canada on
or after April 1, 1987.
    Masse told reporters that the government's oil industry aid
package is aimed at small and medium sized companies.
    The aid package, called the Canadian Exploration and
Development Incentive Program, will restrict the total payments
that any individual company can claim to 10 mln dlrs a year.
    Masse said the program will probably generate new
employment equivalent to 20,000 people working for a year.
    He said oil industry aid is needed because exploration and
development spending dropped by at least 50 pct since world oil
prices fell during the first half of 1986.
    Energy Minister Masse said the federal government decided
to provide cash incentives so a large number of non-tax paying
companies, mainly small Canadian firms, will receive the full
value of the incentive. Such companies would not immediately
benefit from tax benefits, he said.
    The federal government also wanted to deliver an aid
program outside the tax system. Finance Minister Michael Wilson
is now reviewing Canada's tax system and plans to announce tax
reform proposals later this spring.
    An important feature of the aid program is a decision to
let companies issue flow-through shares, allowing investors to
benefit from the subsidy rather than restricting benefits to
only participating companies, he said.
    Allowing flow-through shares under the program will make it
easier for companies to attract investors in exploration and
development, Masse said.
    He told reporters his department is still considering
whether to allow partnerships and other entities to qualify for
the subsidy.

7.4 billion dlrs for less than half of Standard Oil Co has
signalled higher values in the U.S. oil patch, analysts said.
    "I think that BP's bid is a very strong affirmation and
clear signal that they have confidence in the U.S., and they
think the barrel of oil in the ground is going to go higher,"
said Sanford Margoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
    BP earlier today said its U.S. unit planned to tender at 70
dlrs per share for the 45 pct of Standard it does not already
own.
    "It's a 7.4 billion dlr price that (shows) OPEC has won the
war and oil prices are not going to crack," said Prescott, Ball
and Turben analyst Bruce Lazier.
    "Behind that is a huge implication for the rest of the
energy issues out there in the stock market, particularly those
that are acquisition targets," Lazier said.
    One of those mentioned by Lazier was USX Corp, an
energy-steel concern which had been courted by investor Carl
Icahn and drew the attention of Australian Robert Holmes a
Court last year. Rumors continue to swirl around its stock.
    Margoshes said he does not foresee major U.S. oil firms
falling into takeover situations for several years, with the
exception of possibly Amerada Hess Corp <AHC>. He said most of
the majors found partners in the last round of matchmaking
which ended two years ago, and others restructured to the point
that they have become unattractive.
    U.S. oil stocks rallied in response to the offer. Exxon
Corp <XON> rose 1-1/8 to 88-1/2. Chevron Corp <CHV> jumped
1-1/8 to 58-7/8, and Texaco <TX> climbed 1/4 to 37-3/4. Unocal
Corp <UCL> rose 1-3/4, while Occidental Petroleum Corp <OXY>
climbed 1-1/8 to 34-3/4. Amoco Corp <AN> rose 1-3/8 to 83-3/4.
    Standard Oil's stock was up 6-1/4 in heavy trading to
71-1/8. Earlier in the session it had been at a high of 72-1/4.
Wall Street has speculated British Petroleum may boost its
offer by several dlrs per share, but the company maintained it
would not raise the 70 dlr bid.
    British Petroleum stock rose 2-1/4 to 59-5/8.
    Analysts said the fact British Petroleum made such a bid in
the first place indicates that the British oil giant has
changed its outlook for the oil industry.
    Analysts said last year British Petroleum held one of the
more bearish positions on oil prices.
    "They said the real price of oil would stay at 15 dlrs (a
barrel) for several years, and I think they beat a hasty
retreat from that point of view," Margoshes said.
    "They are more appropriately today looking more
optimistically. I believe they are looking at 18 dlrs
(long-term)...also in their heart of hearts they believe that
will be exceeded," Margoshes said.
    The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate was
trading today around 18.60 dlrs per barrel.
    Analysts said British Petroleum might have been able to buy
up the rest of Standard Oil for about 50 dlrs per share when
oil prices were falling last year.
    They said Standard Oil's brightest asset is its slightly
more than 50 pct ownership of the Alaskan Prudhoe Bay oil
field. Analysts also said the company has other interests in
the Alaskan North Slope.
    Analysts said the Standard investment is extremely
attractive to BP because the U.S. is the largest oil market and
has hard-to-replace reserves.
    "I think it just fits in with their long-range plans to
increase their position in the U.S. market," Dean Witter
analyst Eugene Nowak said.
    Analysts said it also raises BP's visibility ahead of the
British government's announced disposal of 31.7 pct of BP
stock. The U.K. government said it would dispose of the holding
sometime in the year beginning April one.
    After acquiring all of Standard, most of BP's reserves
would be in the U.S., but only about six pct of its stock is
held in the U.S.
    "The only way they can sell all that stock is to move it
into the United States. No other market can handle all that
stock," said L.F. rothschild analyst Rosario Ilacqua.
    In 1986, Standard Oil had net losses of 345 mln dlrs on
revenues of 10.02 billion dlrs, compared to a profit the year
earlier of 308 mln dlrs on revenues of 13.82 billion dlrs.

predicted a modest economic recovery in the Gulf Arab states
following higher oil revenues.
    A bank study, carried by the Emirates news agency WAM, said
total oil revenues of the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
countries were likely to reach 39 billion dlrs this year from
33.5 billion in 1986.
    The GCC groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia
and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
    The bank said the improvement would result from higher oil
prices made possible by last December's OPEC accord to restrain
overall group production.
    These curbs have pushed up oil prices from around eight
dollars a barrel in mid-1986 to around 18 dlrs.
    "All signs point to the possibility of a modest recovery in
the economies of these (GCC) countries, although this expected
growth will not be similar to that of the (1970s) boom years,"
the study said.
    It added, however, that GCC states would experience higher
budget deficits this year because of needs arising from past
recession and the difficulty of making fresh spending cuts.
    The study said the combined GCC bugdet deficits would rise
to 23.2 billion dlrs from 17.9 billion last year.
    It said lower oil exports cut the GCC states' combined
trade surplus to 18 billion dlrs in 1986 from 21.5 billion in
1985.
    The UAE suffered a 19.5 pct drop in gross domestic product
to 77.6 billion dirhams last year from 96.4 billion in 1985, it

impact of falling oil prices, kept inflation within limits and
boosted exports, Finance Minister Radius Prawiro said.
    Indonesia was badly hit by last year's steep plunge in
crude prices, which cut revenue from oil exports by half.
    But Prawiro was quoted by Indonesian newspapers as telling
President Suharto that inflation was kept to around nine pct in
the financial year ending tomorrow, against around 4.3 pct the
previous year.
    Exports were estimated to have risen by seven pct, he said,
although he did not give complete figures.
    The depressed economy forms the main backdrop to general
elections next month in Indonesia, a major producer of rubber,
palm oil, tin, timber and coffee.
    Prawiro said 1986/87 had also been difficult because of the
appreciation of currencies like the yen and the mark against
the dollar, which increased Indonesia's debt repayments.
    He said the economy would have suffered more from the world
economic recession if the government had not devalued the
rupiah by 31 pct last September.
    In an editorial on the economic outlook, the Jakarta Post
said the government must press ahead with measures to
deregulate the economy to help boost non-oil exports.
    The English-language daily said bigger export earnings were
needed to finance not only imports but also the country's
growing foreign debt, estimated at around 37 billion dlrs.
    "About 50 pct of our foreign debt obligations fall due
within the next three to five years and will steadily increase
the debt servicing burden," the paper said.
    However, end-investors were seen bargain hunting in
expectation of a further yen interest rate decline, dealers
said.
    Most dealers were cautious in the face of the dollar's
nosedive today and the possibility of a U.S. Interest rate
rebound to halt further dollar depreciation.
    A 4.7 pct coupon and volume of 1,400 billion yen for the
April 10-year bond proposed by the Finance Ministry this
afternoon were taken favourably by the market.

refineries rose slightly in the U.S. and the Mediterranean 
last Friday from the previous week but were lower elsewhere,
according to calculations by Reuters Pipeline.
    The soft tone to refining margins reflects large worldwide
stocks of petroleum products and thin trading activity, traders
said.
    In the U.S. Gulf, sweet crudes rose in value by as much as
26 cts a barrel for West Texas Intermediate, an increase of 1.4
pct from the previous Friday, while sour crudes, such as
Alaska North Slope, were up one pct.
    In the Mediterranean, netback values were up 17 cts to 22
cts a barrel, with Arab Light up 17 cts a barrel to 18.62 dlrs,
a 0.9 pct increase from the previous Friday and Urals were up
22 cts a barrel to 19.16 dlrs, a 1.2 pct increase.
    But netbacks for crude oil refined in Northern Europe was
generally lower with Brent valued at 18.89 dlrs, off 30 cts
from the previous friday, and Bonny Light was off 17 cts to
19.58 dlrs a barrel.
    Refinery netbacks in Singapore were also lower, with
heavier and sour crudes weakest. Arab Heavy dropped 10 cts to
16.63 dlrs a barrel and Dubai was off 12 cts to 18.09 dlrs.
    On the U.S. West Coast, however, netback values for ANS CIF

reduce operations if they want to be profitable this year, said
industry officials attending the National Petroleum Refiners
Association meeting here.
     "If the refining sector can discipline itself to refine
about 12 mln barrels of crude oil a day, we have a chance to
pull down inventories to acceptable levels by the second
quarter, said Archie Dunham, executive vice president of
petroluem products at Conoco Inc
    "If not, the industry will have a tough 1987," he added.
     Last week's American Petroleum Institute report said that
U.S. refining capacity rose three pct to 78.7 pct of capacity,
with crude oil runs at 12.2 mln barrels per day for the week
ended March 20.
     The API said that with the higher crude oil runs, 
distillate and gasoline inventories were sharply above year-ago
levels. Gasoline stocks were at 245.6 mln barrels, some 17.2
mln barrels above year-ago levels. Distillate stocks, at 108.7
mln barrels, are 10.9 mln barrels above last year's level, the
API said.
     Henry Rosenberg, chairman of Crown Central Petroleum Corp
<CNP> told Reuters that unless refining and marketing return to
profitability, oil companies will have to rely on downstream
operations to produce an acceptable level of earnings.
     "The jump in refining capacity is a concern if it
continues," said Kenneth Buckler, executive vice president of
refining and marketing at <Total Petroleum Co>, a U.S.
subsidiary of Cie Francaise Des Petroles of France.
     Refineries should operate near 75 pct of capacity given
the current level of demand but the operating level should
increase as gasoline demand picks up in the next quarter,
Buckler said.
     Dunham said the potential operable capacity of U.S.
refineries should also be cut about 500,000 barrels of crude
per day. "I expect to see the shutdown of more small refineries
over the next five years," he said, adding that these
facilities refine between 10,000 and 30,000 barrels of crude
oil per day. The API said U.S. operations have the capacity to
refine 15.6 mln bpd of crude.

company Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. wants to raise its
worldwide refining capacity by 150,000 barrels of per day, a
company official attending the National Petroleum Refiners
Association meeting here said.
    He declined to be identified but said PdVSA has the
capacity to refine about 650,000 bpd of crude oil from refining
centers
in Venezuela, Sweden, West Germany, Belgium, and the United
States. The company recently purchased a 50 pct stake in the
Corpus Christi, Texas refinery of Champlin Petroleum Co, a

     According to the official, Venezuela is searching
worldwide for the additional refining capacity but he did not
mention where the company was looking. 
    Refineries abroad, he said, guarantee a refining outlet for
Venezuelan crude oil while ensuring stability of supply to

liquified coal and other kinds of synthetic fuels, halted in
recent years because of cheap and abundant petroleum supplies,
will become economic again when world oil prices top 30 dlrs a
barrel, an Exxon Co USA executive said.
    Joe McMillan, a senior vice president, told Reuters after
addressing a Houston meeting of the American Institute of
Chemical Engineers, "By early in the next century, synthetics
should play a significant role in this country's energy
supply."
    McMillan also told reporters at a news conference that he
believed synthetic fuels would become economic to develop when
world oil prices reached a 30 to 40 dlr a barrel price range.
    "You're talking about a 50 pct increase in crude oil
prices, but I think that time is coming and we've got to be
prepared," McMillan said.
    He predicted U.S. oil demand would rise by about one pct
annually in the next few years while the nation fails to
replace its oil reserves through exploration. By the turn of
the century, world oil prices will be significantly higher
because of declining supplies, McMillan said.
    Ashland Oil, Inc. chairman John Hall, who also spoke at the
meeting, advocated some form of federal tax incentives to help
spur development of synthetic fuels.
    The United States, Hall said, has nearly 500 billion tons
of demonstrated coal reserves, an amount more than triple that
of all the world's known oil reserves.
    "We must encourage research now in order to make synfuels
competitive later," Hall said. The average lead time for
development of a shale oil or liquified coal project is between
five and ten years.
    Until last year, the federal government had subsidized
synfuels development through the U.S. Synthetic Fuels Corp., a
research program created during the Carter Administration with
the goal of developing replacements for up to two mln barrels
of oil.
    The corporation was shut down last April when Congress
refused to continue funding its eight billion dlr budget
because of uneconomic projects based on forecasts of 50 dlrs a
barrel oil and 10 dlr per mcf natural gas during this decade.

its Mideast policy in light of its rising dependence on
imported oil, according to Charles Ebinger of the Center for
Strategic and International Studies.
     "The prospect of rising dependence on oil imports from the
Gulf, and the recent revelations of the Tower Commission
report, mandate more than ever before the need for a
fundamental reassessment of U.S. interests in the Middle East,"
Ebinger said.
     He remarks were made in an address to the National
Petroleum Refiners Association meeting.
     "Although in the short run it is difficult to see a direct
link between Arab anger and threats to oil supplies, in the
current environment it will be increasingly difficult for
moderate Arab leaders to be seen as friendly to U.S.
interests," Ebinger said.
     Oil traders said threats to oil supplies has kept crude
oil prices strong recently although some believe prices will be
weaker if demand falls in the spring.
    But William Randol, analyst at First Boston Corp, said
crude oil prices will hold  near current levels this spring.
    There will be no spring downturn, said Randol, speaking at
the annual refiner meeting. He said there is a 40 pct chance
that crude oil prices could move higher in the second half of
the year, following an OPEC meeting scheduled for late June.
    He said he expects OPEC will extend its current agreement
to restrict production.
    OPEC will renew its production pricing agreement in June
because the value of the oil exports of the OPEC producers  has
declined along with the U.S. dollar, Randol said.
    OPEC oil exports are priced in U.S. dollars, and the dollar
has fallen about 30 pct in the last 18 months.
    Randol said U.S. crude oil imports will increase 3.5 to
four mln barrels per day by 1990 as consumption rises 1.5 to
two mln bpd, and supplies decline two mln bpd.

Corp <XON>, is negotiating with it major crude oil suppliers
concerning the effects of a trial deregulation of Alberta's
shut-in crude oil production, scheduled to be implemented on
June 1, a company spokesman said.
    "From our point of view, it's a question of entering into
negotiations or discussions to make appropriate changes to
contracts to reflect the changes that are going to take place
on June 1," spokesman John Cote told Reuters in reply to a
query.
    Commenting on published reports that Imperial had suspended
its oil supply contracts, Cote said: "It's not a question of
cancelling or suspending any of the agreements at this point."
    On June 1, Alberta's Energy Resources Conservation Board
will lift its crude oil marketing prorationing system,
regulating shut-in light and medium crude production, on a
trial basis to the end of 1987.
    Under the new system, producers and refiners will be
allowed to negotiate volumes of shut-in oil to be delivered
under purchase contracts.
    Shut-in crude is the surplus between the total amount of
oil being produced and the amount being purchased by refiners.
    "We have talked to a number of our major suppliers, and
we've discussed the upcoming change with them, but nothing has
been finalized," Imperial's manager of western crude supply Gary
Strong said.
    Under Alberta's trial system, Imperial wants to match a
reasonable supply of crude against the company's forecast
demand for its refineries, Strong said.
    "We have to know what they have and how that relates to what
we need in total," he said.

expected to exceed the 165 mln dlrs, or 65 cts per share,
reported for 1986's fourth quarter, chairman Richard Morrow
said.
    Speaking to reporters after a security analyst meeting, he
said the gain was expected because of higher oil and gas
prices, but declined to compare his expectations with the 331
mln dlrs, or 1.28 dlrs per share, the company earned in 1986's
first quarter.
    Earlier, Morrow told the analysts that Amoco's first
quarter refining and marketing results "will look pretty poor,"
because of low margins in January and February. The margins
began to improve last month and look pretty good now, he added.
    Morrow said he expects oil product margins to remain good
for the rest of the year, "but it remains to be seen if they
will match 1986 levels." The Amoco chairman said he expects
crude oil prices to remain in the 17 to 20 dlr barrel range for
the rest of 1988 based on his belief that OPEC's agreement will
hold.
    Morrow said his best estimate for 1989 crude oil prices is
21 dlrs per barrel, adding he believes this price level would
result in a 40 pct increase in oil company exploration
spending.
    President H. Lawrance Fuller told the analysts Amoco
reduced its estimates of worldwide oil and gas reserves by a
total of 201 mln equivalent barrels last year because of a drop
in oil and gas prices.
    Noting the Securities and Exchange Commission requires that
reserves be estimated on the assumption that year-end prices
will remain fixed for the life of the properties, he said the
drop in oil prices to 16 dlrs a barrel at the end of 1986 from
27 dlrs a year earlier forced the company to reduce its reserve
estimate by four pct.
    Fuller said Amoco expects its U.S. oil and natural gas
liquids production to decline about five pct this year from
last year's 121 mln barrels because of drilling deferrals made
last year when oil prices were falling.
    He said the full impact of the deferrals was off-set by the
purchase of properties which will add about 5,000 barrels per
day to the company's 1987 U.S. production.
    Fuller said U.S. refining capacity is expected to be
increasingly strained by the rising demand for lead-free
gasoline, especially the higher octane grades.
    He said expected federal regulations on gasoline vapor
pressure will further tighten the industry's gasoline
production capacity.

forecast that British Petroleum Plc <BP.L> may have to close
its refinery in Gothenburg because of an anticipated worsening
of the Swedish petroleum industry's competitiveness.
    It said in a report that the future of the Swedish refining
business was bleak due to the steady drop in domestic oil
consumption since the mid-1970s, a possible tightening of rules
on sulphur content and competition from Norway's Mongstad
facility of <Den Norske Stats Olieselskab> (Statoil) <STAT.OL>
when its expansion is completed in the 1990s.
    The committee said the BP refinery, which lacks a
de-sulphurisation plant, was likely to be closed or sold unless
costly investments were made to enhance the facility's capacity
to refine a broader range of products.
    But the committee noted that capacity utilisation had in
recent years been above that of the European refining industry
on average. The BP plant, in which Sweden's state-owned <OK

annual capacity of 4.7 mln tonnes.

packages and corporate spending cuts will help Canada's oil
industry recover from last year sharp downturn, industry
analysts said.
    They said there will be significant earnings gains in 1987
compared to last year's dismal results when oil prices dropped
about 50 pct.
    On Canada's stock exchanges, energy shares have soared to
their highest levels since 1983, with many issues trading at
record highs.
    "This is reflecting a tremendous amount of optimism on the
part of the investment community that the outlook for the
industry for the future is extremely attractive," Peters and Co
Ltd oil analyst Wilf Gobert said.
    Financial statements from Canada's major oil companies,
culminating with Dome Petroleum Ltd's 2.20 billion Canadian dlr
1986 loss reported this week, painted a bleak picture of last
year's results, analysts said.
    "But the financial statements are a snap shot and a
recording of history. The stock market is the indication of the
future," Gobert commented.
    The Toronto Stock Exchange's oil and gas index of 41
companies is up to 4065.4 so far in trading today from 3053.15
at the end of 1986.
    Among Canada's largest oil companies, class A shares of
Imperial Oil Ltd <IMO.A>, 70 pct owned by Exxon Corp <XON>, is
trading at 71, up from a 52-week low of 34-3/4.
    Shell Canada Ltd, 72 pct owned by Royal Dutch/Shell Group,
is at 40-1/2, up from a low during the last year of 18-3/4.
Texaco Canada Inc <TXC>, 78 pct owned by Texaco Inc <TX>, is
at 34-7/8, up from a low of 24-1/2.
    Levesque Beaubien Inc oil analyst Robert Plexman forecasts
operating profit for 10 of Canada's largest oil and gas
companies will rise 37 pct in 1987 to about 1.44 billion dlrs
and operating cash flow will increase 12 pct to 3.24 billion
dlrs, based on an average oil price for the year of 16.50 U.S.
dlrs a barrel. "However, if prices hold about 18 U.S. dlrs a
barrel...1987 net operating income could show a 69 pct increase
with cash flow 27 pct higher," analyst Plexman said.
    "Although it is difficult to forecast the extent of the
profit improvement this year, the gain should be significant,"
he added.
    Those improvements follow a sharp downturn in 1986, when
operating income for the ten companies dropped 47 pct to 1.05
billion dlrs and operating cash flow fell 22 pct to 2.90
billion dlrs.
    But one industry source doesn't think oil prices will hold
recent gains and more government assistance is needed.
    Canadian Petroleum Association technical director Hans
Maciej sees industry cash flow falling another 10 pct in 1987,
after dipping about 60 pct last year. Maciej said he sees crude
oil supply outweighing demand and doesn't believe a recent OPEC
production accord will continue to support prices.
    However, several companies share the optimistic industry
outlook expressed by a majority of analysts.
    Shell Canada and <Norcen Energy Resources Ltd> forecast
improved 1987 earnings in their annual reports issued this
week, assuming oil prices remain at or above 1986 levels.
    "The industry's outlook for 1987 is positive, but not
robust," Texaco Canada said in its annual report.
    "While oil prices have strengthened somewhat and there is
good reason to believe that the general level is sustainable,
continued volatility is likely," Texaco Canada added.
    In the face of short-term uncertainty, many companies have
pared 1987 spending plans from last year's lower levels,
deferring most frontier exploration work.
    "The industry is becoming very selective in investments,
very conservative and cautious, which is not unexpected,"
Canadian Petroleum Association's Maciej said.
    Federal and Alberta goverment aid measures helped cushion
the industry downturn in 1986 and are improving 1987 results.
    The most significant help came last September when the
federal government lifted the 10 pct Petroleum Gas Revenue Tax
(PGRT) 28 months earlier then planned.
    Analysts estimate the tax relief will save larger oil
companies about 1.50 billion dlrs by the end of 1988.
    The PGRT cut helped brake the steep profit and cash flow
decline in 1986 for many oil companies and prevented further
exploration spending cuts, analysts said.
    "For a number of companies, the PGRT cut was absolutely
necessary to even maintain the kind of reduced investments that

(UAE) dropped ten pct in March from February to an average 1.05
mln barrels per day (bpd), mainly because of customer
resistance to fixed prices of Abu Dhabi oil, industry sources
said.
    The UAE quota assigned by the Organisation of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) is 902,000 bpd. Traders could buy
Abu Dhabi's Umm Shaif crude on the spot market for 17.50 dlrs a
barrel yesterday, against the official OPEC price of 17.72
dlrs.
    The sources said output by Abu Dhabi, the largest UAE
producer, fell to around 700,000 bpd from a range of
800,000-820,000 bpd during the preceding four months.
    Dubai production slipped to an average 350,000 bpd from
around 370,000 in February after the emirate declared a
mid-February output cut to help boost world oil prices, the
sources added.
    Most of the Abu Dhabi drop came from the offshore Umm Shaif
and Upper and Lower Zakum fields as customers found fixed
prices too high and cut liftings, the sources said.
    The onshore Murban grade was less affected because Japanese
term buyers saw strategic benefit in maintaining liftings, they
added. The Japanese firms lift around 120,000 bpd, most of it
Murban.
    Abu Dhabi considers output from Upper Zakum, which came on
stream in 1983, to be test production not included in
calculations for complying with the OPEC quota.
    Without Upper Zakum, the UAE would be producing roughly its
quota in March, the sources added.

industrialised countries is likely to slow to around one pct
this year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986, the International
Energy Agency (IEA) said.
    Oil use in the 24 countries of the OECD increased by around
one pct in first quarter 1987 to 35.9 mln bpd, the IEA said in
its Monthly Oil Market Report.
    Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily from
transport fuels, as in 1986. But if average consumer prices are
higher than 1986, the rate of growth for these fuels may be
below last year's 3.6 pct, it said.
    The IEA said that assuming crude oil and product prices
stay close to current levels, some destocking by end-users can
be expected. If that happens, natural gas will also regain some
of the market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986, and there
may be slightly less growth in transport fuels.
    IEA estimates on April 1 put oil stocks in the OECD area at
428 mln tonnes, representing 98 days of forward consumption.
This is about the same level as at the begining of the year.
    The agency said this flat trend is explained by the
projected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter of
the year which offset a reduction in stocks.
    It said initial estimates indicate that company stocks fell
by 1.2 mln bpd in OECD countries in the first quarter of the
year. This followed a small rise in January of 0.4 mln bpd but
a decline of 1.5 mln bpd in February and 2.5 mln bpd in March.
    It is possible that final data will show a larger draw,
particulary for March, it said. As crude production also fell,
there is likely to have also been a decline in non-reported
stocks, particularly at sea, the IEA said.
    Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonnes
on April 1 against 316 mln on April 1 1986. Governments built
up strategic stocks to 102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in the
period.
    The year-on-year trend of government stock building is
continuing with year-on-year company stocks also rising, more
or less in line with consumption, after declining for five
years, the IEA noted.
    Oil stocks on land in the U.S. And Canada were put at 206.6
mln tonnes on April 1, down from the 214 mln tonnes on January
1 and equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption,
respectively.
    Oil stocks in Western Europe were 147.4 mln tonnes on April
1, down from the 154 mln on January 1 but still equivalent to
94 days of consumption.
    World oil supply fell in the first quarter by about two mln
bpd to 45.2 mln bpd from 47.2 mln bpd in last quarter 1986.
    This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crude
production to around 15.5 mln bpd in February/March from 16.5
mln bpd in January and to the seasonal drop in exports from
centrally-planned Economies, the IEA said.
    Total OPEC crude oil supply was 15.8 mln bpd in the first
quarter, plus 1.4 mln bpd of NGLs, compared with 17.3 mln bpd
of crude in the last three months of 1986 and 17.9 mln average
for the whole of 1986. Supply from non-OPEC countries totalled
28 mln bpd, against 28.5 mln bpd in the fourth quarter 1986.
    A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast
3.3 mln bpd in March from 3.6 mln bpd in February was the
largest factor behind the OPEC production decline, the IEA
said.
    Saudi Arabia"s Opec-assigned output quota is 4.133 mln bpd.

    The agreement, signed at a public ceremony in the presence

    Hong Kong-based Enim Oil is contracted to spend 120 mln

    The 1,137 sq km Lematang block is located between two oil

there is a good chance of getting a high return on investment.
    A spokesman said the area, which has not been drilled

    The agreement is similar to a production-sharing contract
Pertamina signed with Occidental Petroleum Corp in February.

prices to remain steady through June, when the next
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' (Opec) meeting
is scheduled to take place.
    Prices have kept to a narrow trading range for more than a
month, despite coming under considerable pressure in February
as Japanese oil companies holding high oil stocks strongly
resist paying official prices, trade sources said.
    Despite these attempts, spot crude rose steadily to
stabilize around OPEC's 18 dlr a barrel target, they said.
    Spot prices fell more than two dlrs during the month,
mainly on market assumptions Opec was producing more than its
15.8 mln barrel a day (bpd) self-imposed ceiling and members
would submit to pressure to discount prices, oil traders said.
    However, Opec's discipline in holding its price and output
targets eventually forced many of the buyers back, they said.
    Countries such as Qatar, Iran and Iraq refused to bend to
demands for lower prices in spite of threats of non-lifting
from Japanese buyers.
    The solidarity of Opec encouraged Qatar to charter vessels
to store its production rather than cut its prices, they said.
    Opec's March production was 14.6 mln bpd, 1.2 mln below its
ceiling, with Saudi Arabia's output just below 3.0 mln bpd
compared to its Opec quota of 4.133 mln bpd, the Middle East
Economic Survey estimated.
    "Of course there was a little cheating but not enough to
destroy the market," an oil trader in Tokyo said.
    Opec crudes have been appearing on the spot market at
discounted prices through barter deals and the swapping of
Middle East grades for North Sea cargoes, but these trades have
not generated sufficient volume to depress the market, he said.
    The current spot values of Middle East grades are only 20
to 25 cts below official prices, so resistance to buying crude
under term contracts in the second quarter is likely to be
weaker, traders said.
    Indonesia's Minister of Energy and Mines Subroto said today
OPEC faces the choice of either maintaining present output
volume at 15.8 mln bpd and seeing prices increase slightly, or
raising the production ceiling so members can produce more in
the third and fourth quarters of 1987.

foreign oil sources may reach record levels by the mid-1990s,
according to John H. Lichtblau, president of Petroleum Industry
Research Associates.
    Lichtblau, speaking at an alternative energy conference
here, said the U.S. may depend on foreign suppliers for as much
as 52 pct of its oil by 1995, surpasssing the previous high
level of 47 pct in 1977.
    "The long term growth in dependency on foreign oil is
inevitable," Lichtblau said. As much as 30 pct of U.S. oil
imports in 1995 could come from OPEC nations, he said.
    Lichtblau said the U.S. depended on foreign suppliers for
33 pct of its oil in 1986 and predicted that would increase to
40 pct by 1990.
    "However, the rate of this growth can be affected
positively or negatively through government action or
inaction," Lichtblau said.
    He said that one of the government's negative actions is
the maintenance of the windfall profits tax which acts as a
disincentive to developing existing fields and reduces cash
flow for oil exploration.
    Lichtblau called for the adoption of an international floor
price for crude oil to help stabilize world oil prices.
    "An international floor price adopted by all or most
industrial countries would clearly be a much more effective
measure and would be much less distortive for the U.S. than if
we imposed it alone," Lichtblau said.
    Development of alternate energy sources such as synthetic
fuels as well as increased development in Alaska could lessen
U.S. dependency on foreign oil, Lichtblau said.
    A potential for alternative supplies could limit the
willingness of OPEC nations to raise oil prices, he said.
    Lichtblau also called for the federal government to offer
tax abatements for oil drilling, to fill the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve at a faster rate and to develop pilot plans
for alternative energy.

oil supply lines following yesterday's court filing for
protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankrupcty code, said
Elton Yates, Texaco's coordinator of worldwide operations.
    "Several companies say they are willing to start trading,"
Yates told Reuters in an interview.
    The company last week had stated that a number of domestic
and international oil suppliers were demanding cash for oil
shipments, and in some cases, had cut supplies altogether.
Banks had also cut credit lines, it said in court filings.
    Manufacturers Hanover Corp <MHC> and other banks told
Texaco it would cut off a one billion dlr credit line, Texaco
said in the court filing. Chase Manhattan Corp <CMB> and J.P.
Morgan Co's <JPM> Morgan Guaranty Trust Co asked for deposits
to cover transactions, it said.
    The severe conditions with suppliers and creditors arose
from an unfavorable ruling last Monday by the U.S. Supreme
Court in Texaco's ongoing dispute with Pennzoil Co <PZL> over
the acquisition of Getty Oil Co in 1984.
    The High Court said Texas Courts must consider Texaco's
plea to cut its 10.3 billion dlr bond while appealing the case.
    "Most of the suppliers stayed with us as long as they
could," Elton said. But following Monday's Supreme Court
ruling, Texaco's suppliers began demanding cash and halting
supplies.
    "It wasn't until last Wednesday that it turned into an
avalanche," he said. "Supplies were cut to the point where we
could not run the system at anywhere near capacity."
    He said less than half of Texaco's oil supplies had been in
jeapordy, but the cut off would have produced severe shortages
by mid-May. Now the situation appears much less severe, Elton
said.
    It said that Sonatrach, the Algerian national oil company,
canceled future deliveries of crude oil and natural gas,
Occidental Petroleum Co <OXY> demanded cash for crude, and
Atlantic Richfield Co <ARC> asked for special safeguards.
    The company also said British Petroleum Co PLC <BP> last
week refused to accept an order for fuel oil. But Yates today
said, "a big U.K. company has in fact said they would go on
supplying. They had cancelled last week."
    He declined to identify the company.
    <Petroleos de Venezuela S.A.>, the Venezuelan state oil
company that supplies a large portion of Texaco's oil, also
halted shipments two weeks ago, Yates said.
    But he added that Texaco expected to meet with the
Venezuelans later today in an attempt to reestablish that key
supply line. Talks were also expected to take place with the
Algerians, he added.
    Bankruptcy specialists said it was likely Texaco's chapter
11 filing would allow the company to secure its credit lines
and oil supplies that are key to the company's business.
    "It will be business as usual for Texaco," said Martin
Klein, a bankruptcy attorney at the New York law firm Dreyer
and Traub.
    "Creditors are a nervous bunch of people," he said. "But
when the dust settles they will reevaluate the situation and
will likely extend credit to the chapter 11 company."
    But other officials at Texaco were not immediately
available to say whether discussions were being held with its
banks, or whether credit lines had been reestablished.

in remarks published today the emirate, largest producer in the
United Arab Emirates (UAE), was succeeding in marketing its
crude oil without breaching OPEC accords.
    Khalaf al-Oteiba, Marketing Director at the Abu Dhabi
National Oil Co (ADNOC), told the company's Petroleum Community
magazine ADNOC was also keen to keep good customer relations.
"The company will maintain its dialogue with and care for its
customers in accordance with market conditions...And take
necessary steps to guarantee marketing its production," he said.
   "The present oil marketing policy of ADNOC is based on
adherence to OPEC decisions of December 1986 to control
production and establish a new pricing system in an attempt to
stabilize the market," he added.
    OPEC agreed last December to limit production to 15.8 mln
bpd and return to fixed prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel.
    Oteiba said stabilization of the oil market in the future
depended on how much discipline OPEC showed.
    Oteiba said last year, when world oil prices dropped, was
ADNOC's most difficult ever but "a practical and flexible
pricing policy was implemented to relate to the changed market
environment."
    He said crude oil sales last year jumped to an average
609,000 bpd of which 73 pct was exported. Refined product sales
totalled eight mln metric tonnes, of which 67 pct was exported.
    In 1985, ADNOC marketed a total of 476,000 bpd of crude oil
and 7.2 mln tonnes of refined products.

filing for protection under the Chapter 11 bankruptcy code is
adding uncertainty to an already skittish oil market, but
opinions are divided on the impact to the market.
    "The filing is holding up wet barrel trading today," said
one trader. "Everyone is talking about it, assessing their

     Some traders said companies that deal with Texaco are
concerned about whether they will receive payment or supplies
under the bankruptcy filing.
    However, others were less worried. "The first paid will be
the trading community and those connected with Texaco in the
shipping industry," one New York trader said.
    "If Texaco doesn't get crude supplies it can't run its
refineries, so its other assets would not be worth anything,"
he added.
    Texaco filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S.

    Traders are assessing whether to require cash prepayment or
letters of credit, or to continue to trade as usual with Texaco
on an open line basis, he said.
    Another trader, however, described today's activity as
business as usual, adding that traders feel more secure because
no liens can be put on Texaco's assets while it is in
bankruptcy.
    Traders said there was no apparent effect of the Texaco

might lower Texaco's position limit and require higher margins
for Texaco's trades.
    New York Mercantile Exchange President Rosemary McFadden

next week to fill up storage tanks as a first step to pump oil
to a Colombian pipeline on May one, the state Ecuadorean

    CEPE manager Carlos Romoleroux told reporters that Ecuador
would begin pumping an unspecified amount of crude in
northeastern jungle oilfields at the end of next week in
preparation to send the oil through a new pipeline link-up to
neighbouring Colombia.
    Oil production in Ecuador was halted on March five when an
earthquake damaged the country's main pipeline from Lago Agrio,
at the heart of the Ecuadorean jungle oilfields, to the pacific
port of Balao.
    It will take at least until the end of July to repair the
pipeline and return output to normal levels. The country was
pumping between 245,000 bpd and 250,000 bpd before the tremor.
    To resume limited output in the meantime, Ecuador is
constructing a 26 mile pipeline linkup, capable of carrying
55,000 bpd, from Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon, the starting point
of Colombia's pipeline to the Pacific port of Tumaco.
    The original target date to resume limited crude output was
May eight, the scheduled date for the inauguration of the Lago

exploration concessions to avert damaging shortfalls due to
last year's oil price slump, the United Nations said.
    The Bangkok-based U.N. Economic and Social Commission for
Asia and the Pacific said in its annual report that the price
fall substantially cut exploration by foreign oil firms, which
found it unprofitable to maintain investments in the region.
    Oil production investment in Indonesia fell to about 2.8
billion dlrs in 1985 from 3.2 billion in 1983 and was estimated
to have declined six pct last year. There were 11 wells drilled
in Thailand in 1986 against 64 in 1985.
    The report said <Thai Shell Exploration and Production Co
Ltd>, a unit of the <Royal Dutch/Shell Group> announced a 30
pct cut in exploration and production spending last year.
    To counter declining output, India and Malaysia reduced
petroleum sharing demands, while Indonesia cut taxes.
    Nepal offered a guaranteed income share of up to 87.5 pct
to cover exploration costs, while Thailand began decreasing its
12.5 pct royalty payments. The big losers were major regional
exporters such as Indonesia, Brunei, China, Malaysia and Iran.
Their aggregate oil income fell an estimated 20 billion dlrs in
1986 from 40 billion the previous year.
    Indonesia's export earnings fell by nearly half in 1986
from 11.6 billion dlrs in 1985, the U.N. Report said.
    Iran also lost about six billion dlrs, Brunei 3.8 billion,
China three billion and Malaysia 0.8 billion.
    However, Asian importers saved between eight and nine
billion dlrs during 1985 and 1986, which considerably eased
their balance of payments.
    South Korea, the Philippines, India, Thailand and Pakistan
were major beneficiaries, with Thailand and Pakistan
respectively saving about 875 mln and 435 mln dlrs last year.

with Colombia to export crude oil for the next five years,
Colombian mines and energy minister Guillermo Perry said.
    The link will be inaugurated on May 8. It was built to
allow Ecuador to resume exports of crude oil halted on March 5
by earthquake damage to its Lago Agrio to Balao pipeline,
    Once that pipeline is repaired, Ecuador will exceed its
OPEC quota in order to offset lost income and pay debts
contracted with Venezuela and Nigeria since the quake, Ecuador
mines and energy minister Javier Espinosa said.
    The two ministers were speaking at a news conference after
signing an agreement for joint oil exploration and exploitation
of the jungle border zone between the two nations. Drilling
will begin in September.
    "The agreement to transport Ecuadorean crude oil is not only
for this emergency period but for the next five years, with
possibility of an extension. Between 20,000 and 50,000 barrels
per day (bpd) will be pumped along it," Perry said.
    Espinosa said Ecuador planned to pump 35 mln barrels
through the link in the next five years, at a cost of 75 cents
per barrel during the first year.
    The 43-km link, with a maximum capacity of 50,000 bpd, will
run from Lago Agrio, the centre of of Ecuador's jungle
oilfields, to an existing Colombian pipeline that runs to the
Pacific port of Tumaco.

Qatar are coming under renewed pressure and foreign banks are
retrenching further in one of the region"s most overbanked
markets.
    Results for 1986 show a year of declining profit for
several foreign banks, although locally-owned operations were
in some cases able to cushion the drop by increasing market
share.
    <Qatar National Bank SAQ>"s (QNB) General Manager, Abdulla
Khalid al-Attiya, said: "The economy is not improving as we
hoped... 1987 will be another difficult year for the banks."
    Oil-dependent Qatar, with a tiny indigenous population of
60,000 to 80,000 and an expatriate workforce estimated at about
280,000, boasts five local banks and 10 foreign bank
operations.
    Local and foreign bankers in the capital said the Gulf-wide
recession, aggravated this year by Qatar"s severe difficulty
marketing its crude oil at official OPEC prices, has taken a
heavy toll on the economy and bank profitability.
    As a result, the only U.S. Bank, <Citibank NA>, is thought
to be negotiating to sell its operation to the fast growing
locally based <Al Ahli Bank of Qatar QSC> which only started
operations in 1984, bankers said. Citibank would not comment.
    Other foreign banks have retrenched, with <Standard
Chartered Bank> cutting staff and others expected to follow.
<Banque Paribas> is examining a change in its status to admit
51 pct Qatari ownership in a bid to improve its access to local
business, bankers said.
    One banker added: "Weak profits are here to stay for the
time being. There is no cause for optimism at the moment."
    Sentiment had picked up briefly at the end of last year
when OPEC reached its accord to curb oil output and return to
fixed prices. However, it soon became apparent that Qatar was
having difficulty selling oil at OPEC prices.
    The soft spot oil market has left official Qatari crude
prices 20 to 40 cents more expensive and sales have been
running in recent weeks at 100,000 and 120,000 barrels per day,
well down on the nation"s OPEC quota of 285,000, oil sources
said.
    Bankers said this serious shortfall in Qatar"s revenue has
led to a new spate of payments delays from the public sector to
private contractors after a marginal improvement in January.
    Loan loss provisions continued to eat into bank profits
last year, as did the introduction of minimum reserve
requirements by the Qatar Monetary Agency. Trade financing has
almost dried up as a traditional source of bank income.
    Of the local banks, QNB conducts the bulk of the
government"s business and subsequently enjoys a huge advantage
its rivals cannot expect to match, bankers said.
    The bank reported a 2.9 pct rise in net 1986 profit to 93.1
mln Qatari riyals, while its balance sheet grew by 10.8 pct to
9.0 billion, making it by far the largest bank in Qatar.
    But the strong assets growth partly reflected bridging
loans for the public and private sector to tide government
departments and local business over the lean economic spell,
Attiya said. "Generally speaking, we are overbanked in Qatar," he
said, echoing a widespread feeling in the banking community.
    Other local banks fared less strongly. The second largest,
<Doha Bank Ltd QSC>, reported a 13 pct drop in net profit to
27.5 mln riyals, while <Commercial Bank of Qatar Ltd QSC>,
registered a decline to 18.5 mln riyals from 19.4 mln in 1985.
    The newcomer Al Ahli Bank, continued to expand rapidly and
reported net profit of 5.2 mln compared with 3.3 mln during the
start-up period from August 4, 1984 to end-1985.
    Bankers said the local banks had clearly begun to win
commercial deposits previously held by foreign banks,
increasing already strong pressure on non-Qatari banks to
reexamine their staffing levels and overheads.
    <Grindlays Bank PLC> recorded a net loss at its Doha branch
last year of 4.7 mln riyals after registering a nominal profit
in 1985 of 12,000 riyals.
    Two other long-established banks in the Gulf, the <British
Bank of the Middle East> (BBME) and Standard Chartered, also
found last year a difficult climate to make strong profits.
    BBME"s net profit fell to 3.2 mln riyals from 10.4 mln in
1985, but Assistant Manager John Farquharson said 1985"s result
had been artificially inflated by tax rebates on provisions.
    "Foreign banks are seeing their assets decline, while local
banks are increasing their market share," Farquharson said.
    BBME"s operating profit was steady in 1986, edging up to
12.3 mln riyals from 11.5 mln in 1985. "We are expecting the
same level of operating profit in 1987," Farquharson said.
    Standard Chartered"s net profit last year recovered slightly
to 1.6 mln riyals after a loss of 161,000 in 1985. Staff
numbers were cut last year to reduce overheads.
    Bankers said the lack of new construction projects in Qatar
means business is unlikely to pick up this year although hopes
are rising that the start of Qatari gas exploitation could
provide a boost. But the threat of higher U.S. Interest rates
may erode bank deposits as savings are moved offshore.

Herrington told reporters at the World Petroleum Congress.
    He said the oil industry was experiencing difficult times

price OPEC put into effect in February -- and supply and demand
have been in equilibrium since March.
    If OPEC does not increase overall output in the second half

producers have not been able to produce more oil at current

barrels at its next meeting in June.
    He said in his speech that world oil production over the

mln barrels a day less than world oil demand.
    Oil production by industrialized countries, particularly
the U.S. And Canada, is expected to decrease this year, but
some of that slack will be taken up by increased production in
Cameroon, India and other developing countries, he said.
    This year is a battle between OPEC and non-OPEC oil
producers and consumers in the industrialized world for the
upper hand in world oil markets, Subroto said in an earlier
speech to management trainees at Pertamina Oil Company.
    "If OPEC emerges the winner, than it can gradually resume

Subroto said.

oil prices above the current benchmark of 18 dlrs per barrel
unless oil demand grows strongly, the Middle East Economic
Survey (MEES) said.
    The Cyprus-based weekly newsletter quoted authoritative
Saudi sources as saying the Kingdom's oil price policy would
not change "unless and until there is a strong revival in the
growth of demand for oil."
    MEES said this contradicted recent hints of new Saudi price
hawkishness from U.S. Congressional and oil industry sources.
    The Saudi sources said their policy was firmly based on the
long-term need to restore the competitive position of oil in
general and OPEC oil in particular against other energy
sources.
    "Saudi Arabia is certainly committed to cooperating with its
OPEC partners to exercise the necessary production restraint to
maintain the 18 dlr per barrel reference price level," MEES
said.
    The newsletter said Saudi output in the first three weeks
of April averaged slightly above its OPEC quota of 4.133 mln
barrels per day (bpd). Output would fall in the last week,
causing the month's average to be below quota, MEES said.
    MEES estimated overall OPEC production for April at around
16.8-16.9 mln bpd -- two mln bpd more than both its figures for
March and Reuter estimates for March.
    It said Iranian production had risen by 500,000 bpd this
month to 2.2-2.3 mln bpd, around its quota level. In Iraq, with
an OPEC-assigned quota of 1.466 mln bpd, output rose this month
to two mln bpd, not including "war relief" supplies from Kuwait
and Saudi Arabia, the newsletter said.
    Nigeria, which has had problems selling its full 1.238 mln
bpd entitlement, increased its output to 1.2 mln bpd, it added.

considering tax incentives to boost oil output and restore
100,000 jobs, U.S. Energy Secretary John Herrington said.
    A tax credit for new exploration would be part of a package
to bring 1,000 idle drilling rigs back into operation and raise
domestic production by one mln barrels a day, he said.
    The tax status of exploration might also be changed,
Herrington told reporters at the World Petroleum Congress.
    He said the oil industry was experiencing difficult times
internationally and had been devastated in the United States.
    Consumer demand and a significant decline in domestic
production has resulted in a rise in oil imports of one mln
barrels a day in over the last 16 months, Herrington said.
    "Steps must be taken...To reverse the downturn in our
domestic energy industry and to safeguard and increase our
energy security," he said.
    The administration is committed to improving marketplace
conditions and incentives to spur exploration and development.
    "This commitment includes rejecting quick fix solutions,
like an oil import fee, which are bad for the United States and
bad for the world," he added.

total world energy consumption will continue to grow, but added
new oil discoveries worldwide are slowing down and can not
offset annual production.
    In a speech at the World Petroleum Congress here, Rawl said
oil companies would increasingly be forced to turn to enhanced
recovery techniques, very heavy oil and synthetics to
compensate for substantial declines in conventional oil
production.
    "What our current outlook suggests is that total world
energy consumption will continue to grow steadily in an ever
more energy efficient world," Rawl said. But, he added, Exxon
projects that "despite today's ample supplies, the world will
also be facing up to inherent limitations on the availability
of oil and gas, which currently supplies more than half of the
world's energy needs."
    The Exxon chairman told some 1,500 oil executives from
around the world that some synthetics projects could become
practical when oil reaches 30 dlrs to 40 dlrs a barrel range in
real terms.
    "The question is when and how this will happen," he said.
"I believe that synthetic projects will not only re-emerge but
will become commercial well below those we were thinking about
the last time oil prices moved substantially higher."
    Rawl said synthetic fuel would become economic at lower
prices because companies are investigating "a new generation of
ideas that promise substantially lower costs" and projects
begun in the late 1970s, which have since been suspended.
    Rawl also said companies must find new and more effective
ways of enhanced recovery from existing oil fields.
    "It would be my view that new oil discoveries, even with
advanced technology, are likely to slow down - not reverse -
the decline in worldwide oil discoveries," he said. "So it is
essential to find a better way to recover more of the
discovered oil from producing fields using chemicals, solvents,
heat, and other techniques."
    Rawl emphasized that private oil companies need some
assistance from government in developing synfuels technology.
"More importantly, they need to provide a political and
economic environment that is stable enough to allow the
developmental process to function effectively, he said.
    Rawl also said stable energy markets serve the best
interest of producing and consuming nations by allowing both
groups to plan for steady economic growth.
    He did not make any oil price prediction, saying only that
the economic goals of the U.S. and other nations can only be
achieved if world oil prices "stabilize within a reasonable
range."
    "Prices must be high enough to meet realistic aspirations
for income and encourage resource development in the producing
countries, but not so high as to inhibit economic growth in
consuming nations," he said.
    The Exxon chairman also criticized "the occasional attempt
of consuming nations to try to control domestic oil prices,
calling such protectionist measures disruptive to the world oil
market.

may soon force the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries to raise its oil benchmark price, setting the stage
for prices as high as 22 dlrs a barrel by yearend, top
executives with U.S. oil companies said.
    The current benchmark price of 18 dlrs a barrel was
established by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) at its December meeting when the cartel set a
15.8 mln barrel per day production ceiling.
    But the continuing weakness of the U.S. dollar, the
currency used by OPEC for its oil sales, is making the 18 dlr
price difficult to sustain, said Fred Hartley, chairman of
Unocal Corp <UCL>.
    The U.S. dollar has fallen in value by about 10 pct since
December and has fallen by a total of about 40 pct during the
past two years.
    Hartley told Reuters he expected significantly higher oil
prices this winter and would not rule out the potential for 25
dlrs a barrel by the spring of 1988.
    "I think June will be the critical month to see what they
do," said Hartley, who was in Houston to attend the World
Petroleum Congress. OPEC has scheduled a regular meeting in
June which some experts believe is likely to revive suggestions
that oil should be priced according to a basket of world
currencies instead of the U.S. dollar.
    E.H. Clark, chairman of <Baker Hughes Inc>, said the Saudi
kingdom's need to generate revenues -- rather than greater
world demand -- would drive any price increases.
    "The Saudis have made committments and have a balance of
trade based on receiving 18 dlrs a barrel for this oil. But the
U.S. dollar won't buy as much as it did five or six months
ago," Clark said in an interview. "I'm betting on the Saudi
king's need to sustain revenues."
    Clark predicted that world oil prices would top 22 dlrs a
barrel by January one.
    However, the authoritative Middle East Economic Survey
reported yesterday that Saudi Arabia would not seek to increase
OPEC oil prices unless oil demand showed strong growth.
    Saudi sources told the newsletter that the policy was based
on the longterm need to restore the competitive position of
OPEC oil against other energy sources.
    Many oil industry experts are forecasting a modest increase
in world oil demand averaging one pct annually during the next
few years.
    Michel Moreau, a director of the <Elf Aquitaine Group>,
said he believed the worldwide oil industry had reached a
consensus that prices of at least 20 dlrs a barrel were
necessary to cover exploration costs, royalties and taxes on
new production.
    The 20 dlr level will be reached this year only if the
cash-strapped nations of Nigeria, Egypt and Gabon refrain from
discounting oil prices or increasing production levels, Moreau
said.
    "I think if more than two (OPEC nations) defect, the
production agreement will fall apart," he said. "But this
threat is the Saudis' big stick to keep producers in line.
Nobody wants a repeat of the collapse that occurred in 1986."
    Lawrence Rawl, chairman of Exxon Corp <XON>, told Reuters
he expected prices would remain at 18 dlrs through the end of
1987, adding that 20 dlrs a barrel was a possibility.
    Other major companies are taking a more cautious view of
prices, fearing that some OPEC members may yet upset the
cartel's production agreement.
    "This is a year of testing," said Alfred Munk, manager of
foreign affairs at Amoco Corp. (AN). "If they fail, there may
be a price decline to about 14 dlrs a barrel."
    French-owned Total CFP's vice president Pierre Vaillaud
said, "Demand is not going up very quickly, at best maybe one
percent a year. You can't change the price with just one pct,"
Vaillaud said.

will attract increasing numbers of government connected firms
in the 1990s, according to Ronald Tappmeyer, Vice Chairman of
Reading and Bates Drilling Co.
     Tappmeyer told the Offshore Technology Conference that
contract drilling was reaching the same kind of situation that
oil producing companies reached when their oilfields were
nationalized in nations as Venezuela, Iran and Saudi Arabia.
     He said local connections to the nation whose waters are
being drilled was an increasingly important factor in the
market.
     "We have seen contractors put at competitive disadvantages
in nations in which they had worked successfully for years
essentially moved aside to make room for locally-owned firms or
a locally-built rig," he said.
     Tappmeyer, who is president of the International
Association of Drilling Contractors, said how far the trend
would spread depends on the growth of trade protectionism.
     He added that international contractors will increasingly
find their role restricted to regions that require special
expertise and experience, such as wildcat areas and severe
environments such as in the Arctic and extremely deep waters.
     Tappmeyer also said he expects producing companies to
provide the main financing for offshore drilling in the coming
decade as banks will be unwilling to repeat overexposing
themselves and drilling contractors will have difficulty
providing financing out of cash flow.
     At the same time, he said he saw the financing as indirect
as he does not see producers getting back in the rig-owning
business.
     He also said projectfinancing will have to be backed up
by work commitments to guarantee the payoff of construction
costs.
     For the time being, he said there was a superabundance of
rigs. But he said there will be a need for new, technologically
advanced rigs within a few years.
     He said the floating-drilling rigs were most likely to
benefit from new developments in technology, adding that by
2,000 there should not be an ocean left that is too deep, too
cold, too stormy or too remote to be explored.

 ]]></BODY><BODY><![CDATA[The oil price collapse of 1986 put
development of a vast petroleum resource -- heavy and extra
heavy oils -- on hold. But as oil prices increase the long-term
economic outlook is favorable, oil industry experts said.
    "Estimated potential world reserves of extra heavy oils
exceed 500 billion barrels, of which more than half are located
in Venezuela," Juan Chacin Guzman, President of Petroleos de
Venezuela told the World Petroleum Congress.
    "And this virtually unused resource represents a prime
example of the need to invest in technology to ensure
tomorrow's energy future," he added.
    Venezuela had to reduce heavy crude oil output in favor of
light oils because of economics and a very limited market. Not
many refineries have been upgraded to process the heavy oils.
    "Improved technology has the potential for reducing the
capital investment and operating costs of typical heavy oil
development projects by 30 pct or more," Gordon Willmon, VP and
general manager, oil sands and coal department, Esso Resources
Canada Ltd said at the World Petroleum Congress.
    Crude oil prices fell under 10 dlrs dlrs a barrel last
summer as OPEC members increased production to gain market
share, but have since risen to around 18 dlrs because the  OPEC
production/pricing agreement is basically in tact.
    Willmon said light and medium crude oils currently supply
90 pct of world oil demand yet they account for less than 25
pct of remaining petroleum resources.
    "So future demand increasingly will be met from the various
forms of heavy oil," Willmon said. Heavy crude oil resources
include extra-heavy oil/tar sand, natural bituminous sands and
oil shales (in sedimentary rock).
     Willmon cited major factors that will make heavy oil
development economical, including real and stable growth in
crude oil prices, favorable fiscal terms, and improved
technology.
    He said he expects "all pieces of the puzzle to fit
together." But he cautioned that the short-term outlook is very
sensitive to crude oil prices. And he said the most important
factor in development of heavy oils is the recovery of the
price of crude.
    Willmon said the price of light crude must be about eight
dlrs higher than heavy crude before there is an incentive for
an oil company to upgrade its refinery to process heavy oil.
    He said the current price differential is only about five
dlrs a barrel.
    Willmon indicated that a benchmark crude oil price above 20
dlrs would be ideal. But he said currently under study are a
broad range of high potential cost-effective technologies for
resources recovery, transportation and upgrading of heavy oils,
which would permit commercial development despite a lower crude
oil price outlook.
    Willmon said these technologies included enhanced recovery
by steam injection and oil-and-water emulsion to reduce the
viscocity of the heavy oils so they can flow easily through a
pipeline. He said such technologies may substantially reduce
current captial investment and operating costs.
    But he emphasized that innovative technology alone may not
encourage new investment, that oil prices need to show a
meaningful and sustained recovery.
   Most of the expenses associated with heavy oils production
is fixed operating costs as in an oil sands project, rather
than in exploration, according to Robert Smith, Senior VP
Operations <Syncrude Canada Ltd>.
    While exploration costs for conventional crude oil range
from four to nine dlrs a barrel, discovery costs for synthetic
crude from oil sands are nearly zero because the location and
nature of the deposit are known, according to Smith.
    But the remote location of oil sands deposits mean that
everything required to build and operate the plant must come
from outside the area.
    Willmon also said, "Public policy could best help by
providing financial support to offset the high cost of
technology developmemt which would help generate projects that
could survive even at low oil prices for extended periods of
time."
    U.S. Energy Secretary John Herrington said, "The Reagan
Administration is firmly committed, without equivocation, to
continuing our efforts to improve conditions and incentives in
the marketplace that will spur oil and gas exploration and
development."

12 Congressmen from oil-producing states.
    The variable import fee would be dropped if oil prices rise

    Revenues from the fee would be used to buy domestic oil

Kasahara said the state-owned Japanese firm hoped to find
additional joint venture partners to explore for U.S. oil
reserves.
    "We have to secure the stability of oil for Japan,"
Kasahara told reporters at the World Petroleum Congress. "In
the exploration area I think Japanese companies are interested
in joint ventures."
    Nippon Mining, for example, last September signed an
agreement with Dupont Co's <DD> Conoco Inc to participate in a
135 mln dlr exploration venture that includes six wells on land
and 14 offshore Louisiana. The first joint well drilled is in
the Gulf of Mexico's Green Canyon Block 182, a deepwater lease
that Conoco was almost forced to return to the federal
government undrilled because of low oil prices.
    "At this moment we have no success but we will proceed with
Conoco. Maybe by the end of the year we will find oil there,"
Kasahara said. He said that similar kinds of joint ventures
"would be best" for Nippon Mining's oil exploration efforts in
the future.
    Kasahara also said Nippon Mining was not planning to
acquire any U.S. refining or marketing outlets. "Retail sales
in general do not interest the Japanese oil companies," he
said.
    When asked whether he believed world oil prices might
strengthen later this year, Kasahara said he expected prices to
hold steady at today's level.
    "Within this year I think the 18 dlrs a barrel will
continue. But next year I don't know," he said. "For the
refining business, stability is important. Whether the price is
18 dlrs or 20 dlrs, we don't care."
    But encouraging additional upstream efforts may require
modestly higher oil prices, Kasahara added. "For exploration I
think 20 dlrs a barrel or 22 dlrs a barrel would be
reasonable," he said.
    The key factor in determining whether the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would raise its 18 dlr a
barrel benchmark price is the ongoing war between Iran and
Iraq, Kasahara said. Saudi Arabia, he added, was an uncertain
element in the OPEC equation because of its need to maintain
revenues at the same time the weakened U.S. dollar has reduced
oil profits.
    Nippon Mining, which like all Japanese crude buyers is
benefitting from the drop in the value of the dollar, favors
continuing to price OPEC crude oil according to U.S. currency
regardless of the dollar-yen relationship, Kasahara said.
    "I hope the dollar would strengthen eventually and continue
to improve. I would prefer to see the (OPEC) pricing remain in
dollars," he said.

the few bright spots in the international oilpatch with about
1,000 rigs currently working and annual increases of 80-100
expected through the end of the century, a Chinese petroleum
official said.
    "In China, production concentrates on the domestic market,
and does not depend on the international price of oil," Zhai
Guang Ming, a director of the Chinese Ministry of Petroleum,
told Reuters.
    Chinese oil sold within the nation's borders is priced at
about one-third the 18 dlr a barrel benchmark price established
by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Zhai said
in an interview at the World Petroleum Congress.
    The optimism in China is in sharp contrast to the United
States where weak oil prices have prompted a steep fall in the
number of active rigs from a 1981 peak of 4,500 to only 765
last week according to the latest Baker Hughes Co rig count.
    At this time, China actually has more rigs in operation
than any other country in the world, said Xianglin Hou, another
member of the 20-man Chinese delegation at the Houston meeting.
    But this does not mean good news for the sagging oilfield
equipment industry in the rest of the world, said Bryan Walman,
international sales manager for Reed Tool Co in Houston.
    Walman said more than 90 pct of China's drilling activity
is on land and under the control of the Chinese government
which requires local manufacture of drilling equipment.
    But U.S. and other western nations do provide equipment for
China's fledgling offshore projects as well as participate in
the actual drilling, he said.
    Amoco Corp <AN>, for example, has reported a discovery in
1,000 feet of water in the South China Sea.
    "We're encouraged," said Alfred Munk, manager of Amoco's
foreign affairs, "but we need substantial reserves before we
can do commercial production in a remote area like that."
     Zhai estimated that current Chinese oil production of 130
mln tonnes a year should rise to total 200 mln tonnes annually
by the year 2,000.
    Chinese crude reserves total 23.6 billion barrels, with
ultimate resources estimated at 69.3 billion barrels.

consumers nearly 17 billion dlrs a year and undermine long-term
U.S. energy security by leading to a quicker depletion of 
domestic reserves, a Federal Trade Commission study said.
    The study by the FTC's bureau of economics found that a
five dlr a barrel tariff on crude oil and gasoline oil imports
would increase costs to consumers by 14 to 16.7 billion dlrs a
year.
    After weighing the benefits of such a tariff against the
costs, the study found a five dlr a barrel import fee would
have a net cost to the economy of 3.6 billion dlrs a year.
    Several oil import fee proposals ranging from two to 10
dlrs a barrel have been made in Congress in an effort to cut
the federal budget deficit and maintain the momentum for energy
conservation programs, which have been hurt by cheaper oil.
    But by making foreign oil more expensive, the tariffs would
reduce oil imports and force greater consumption of domestic
oil, which would deplete U.S. reserves faster, the study found.
    "Any attempt to increase our energy security by limiting
imports will actually reduce our long-run energy security by
speeding the depletion of domestic reserves," the study said.
    The five dlr a barrel tariff would also cut domestic
petroleum refiners' profits by 7.5 to 10 billion dlrs a year,
increase domestic crude oil producers' profits by about 13
billion dlrs a year and raise government revenues by 6.7 to 
8.2 billion dlrs a year, the FTC said.
    Under the Reagan administration, the FTC has consistently
opposed government regulation of the oil industry at the state
and federal levels.
    "This study backs up my belief that government regulation
and interference with competition hurt both the market and
consumers," FTC Chairman Daniel Oliver said in a statement.

still waiting for a turnaround despite increasing optimisim
that world oil prices have stabilized around 18 dlrs a barrel.
     "The perception of a turnaround comes from the change in
prices," Charles Siess Jr, vice chairman of Marathon
Manufacturing Co, a subsidiary of USX Corp <X>, and chairman of
the National Ocean Industries Association, said in a press
briefing at the Offshore Technology Conference.
     "From the level of industry activity, there is no
turnaround," he added.
     John Huff, president of Oceaneering International Inc
<OCER>, was slightly more optimistic. "We are through the low
part of the cycle -- there's an increase in interest for
projects," he said, adding, "whether it comes to orders, who
knows?"
     The oil industry is recovering from last year's dramatic
fall in oil prices, from 30 dlrs a barrel in late 1985 to under
10 dlrs in mid-1986. Particularly hard hit were the service
companies that provide the oil rigs with keys products, such as
pipe and tools.
     Earlier in the week, Secretary the Interior Donald Hodel
announced -- at the Conference -- the government's new
five-year offshore oil and gas leasing program, proposing 38
sales, including tracts in the Gulf Coast, offshore California
and in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska.
     For the most part, the industry was disappointed with the
plan, with most arguing that additional areas should have been
included. At the same time, most were supportive of Hodel.
     Environmental concerns, particularly in California, had
lobbied strenuously against offshore oil development.
     "The (Outer Continental Shelf) leasing program fails to
take into account the environmental performance of the oil
industry," said Bill Bradford, executive vice president of
Dresser Industries <DI> and president of the Petroleum
Equipment Suppliers Association.
     Huff quoted National Academy of Science figures showing
offshore rigs contributed only two pct of petroleum pollution
in the oceans, while tankers were responsible for 47 pct and
municiple dumping 31 pct.
     "The OCS is the keystone of the domestic reserve
development program," said Siess, adding that with oil imports
rising to 50 pct of U.S. oil consumption, the issue was one of
national security.
     Looking ahead, Constantine S. Nicandros, president of
Dupont's <DD> Conoco Inc subsidiary, said, "We are more likely
to see a five pct increase in spending this year than the
widely-forecast five pct decrease."
     Other optimistic signs include the recent sale in New
Orleans of offshore tracts in the Gulf of Mexico which raised
290 mln dlrs against an expected 90 mln.
     However, Ronald Tappmeyer, vice chairman of Reading and
Bates Drilling Co <RB>, said the oversupply of rigs would
continue for the near-term, but added demand for
technologically advanced rigs would increase in the 1990s.
     Much of that demand is seen coming from the move into
icreasingly deeper waters, with the projects becoming ever more
expensive and needing five to ten years to develop.
     Over 50 pct of the sales in New Orleans were for deep
water tracts.
     Ronald L. Geer, a consultant with Shell Oil Co, a
subsidiary of Royal Dutch/Shell <RD>, and president of the
Marine Technology Society, said the technology existed to drill
exploratory wells in up to 10,000 feet of water.
     Geer said the industry was particularly interested in the
Green Canyon field offshore Louisiana where a number of
companies, including Shell, Conoco, USX Corp's Marathon Oil Co,
Standard Oil Co <SRD> and Placid Oil Co, are working, many of
them testing new deep-water technologies involving floating
platforms.

dlrs a barrel until the end of the year, but OPEC's decision on
output at its next meeting would be the critical factor, an
official of Mexico's state oil company, Petroleos Mexicanos
(Pemex), told a group of Japanese businessmen.
    Adrian Lajous, Pemex' executive vice president of
international trade, said current OPEC output already appeared
to be very near the 16.6 mln barrel per day level it set itself
for the third quarter. "Production is surging ahead of what was
originally planned, while demand is growing more slowly than
envisaged a few months ago," he said.
    He said OPEC had to look very carefully at what level of
production in the third quarter would effectively sustain the
18 dlrs price, and that an increase to what had originally been
envisaged might soften price levels.
    The 13-member cartel is scheduled to meet on June 25 in
Vienna to review its December accord on prices and output.
    "I hope OPEC will follow a very conservative attitude in
terms of volume decisions," Lajous said.
    A repetition of what happened last year, when OPEC boosted
output and sent oil prices tumbling down below 10 dlrs, is
always there as a possibility, he said.
    "I hope never again to go through the trauma of 1986. I
expect other oil exporters have learned their lessons and
discipline will be maintained," he said.
    Lajous said there was still excess supply and as long as
this remains there will be a tendency to instability in oil
markets, but prices should remain around 18 to 19 dlrs during
1987 if output remains under control.
    He said Saudi King Fahd's remarks last month, that
increased production was not so important as long as incomes
would not be affected by the output, were "very relevant and
welcome from such a powerful producer."

collective agreement with Aramco to purchase oil for the
latter's ex-partners is moving along and should lead to a
fundamental structural change in the contract, oil industry
sources said.
    Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, in this Monday's edition,
said negotiations are moving along for adjustment of the 1.34
mln bpd joint long term agreement at official prices and
volumes and other terms may be rearranged.
    The agreement signed in January for the months from
February to June is up for renegotiation.
    Under the January contract Aramco was to purchase 1.34 mln
bpd for the four partners allocated among them as Exxon Corp
<XON> 440,000 bpd, Texaco Inc <TX> 350,000 bpd, Mobil Corp
<MOB> and Chevron Corp <CHV> 550,000 bpd between them.
    But an overlifting by Texaco Inc in the first quarter
allowed other companies like Exxon Corp to underlift its
obligations under the contract
    PIW said that that one alternative under consideration is
to revert to four individual contracts rather than a collective
agrement.
    John Lichtblau, director of the Petroleum Industry Research
Foundation Inc said that renegotiation of the pact was more of
a formality as the Saudis have each company on a separate
schedule although separate agreements with the companies would
favor one on one negotiations and ensure that contracted
liftings occur .
    "The companies will probably follow the Saudi wants within
limits as they do not want to antagonize them for the long
haul," he said.
    Lichtblau said that the renegotiations would most likely
concentrate on volume rather than price.
    Saudi displeasure with the agreement has long been noted
and in April industry publications said that renegotiation were
being sought, a fact later confirmed by Reuters with Aramco.
    Aramco Corp was formerly owned by Chevron Corp <CHV>, Exxon
Corp <XON>, Mobil Corp <MOB> and Texaco Inc <TX> but is now

solution to defuse a row between Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap
A/S <STAT.OL> (Statoil) and Conoco Norge A/S over which firm
will operate the Heidrun oil field, government sources said.
    The sources, who asked not to be named, said the government
will likely recommend that Conoco be allowed to continue as the
field's operator through the development phase, with Statoil
taking over only after production starts in the early 1990s.
    Oil Minister Arne Oeien told Reuters the government had
today discused the Heidrun matter but that no final decision
had been taken and several questions remained unresolved.
    It was unlikely the government would announce its decision
on Heidrun operatorship until after Thursday's cabinet meeting
and after discussing a proposed solution with both companies,
the sources added.
    This spring Norway's state-owned oil company Statoil
exercised an option in the Heidrun field exploration license
that, if approved by the government, would allow it to relieve
Conoco as Heidrun operator, a move sharply criticised by
Conoco.
    Heidrun is often cited by the government and industry as
the most likely candidate for the first field development
project on the Haltenbanken exploration tract off central
Norway.

Texas/Oklahoma border has shut down the Basin Pipeline, a
24-inch pipeline that transports as much as 300,000 barrels per
day of sweet and sour crudes from Texas to Cushing, Okla, a
Texaco Pipeline Co spokesman confirmed.
    "The water is rushing by so fast that we can't get any
divers down to assess the damage but there is some possibility
that the pipeline could be up by the end of the week," a company
source said.
    The pipeline transmits roughly two-thirds sour crude and
one-third sweet crude oil from the Midland, Texas region.
    Texaco sources said that if the pipeline service is
restored by Friday there would be little problem in restoring
oil which has been lost to the flood.
    "But if the pipeline is down more than 10 days it will be
difficult to make up without prorationing and we would not like
to proration this pipeline, if we don't have to."
    The Basin Pipeline is jointly owned by Atlantic Richfield
Corp <ARC>, Shell Oil Co, a subsidiary of the Royal Dutch/Shell
Group <RD> and Texaco Inc <TX>, which is the pipeline's
operator.
     Peter Beutel, analyst at Elders Futures Inc, said crude
oil futures contracts on New York Mercantile Exchange rose to
new highs this afternoon following news of the pipeline break.
    July crude futures of West Texas Intermediate traded up to
19.60 dlrs a barrel, a rise of more than 20 cts.
    Cash market prices also firmed on the news with sellers of
WTI raising offers to 19.60 dlrs a barrel.
    Sour crudes, which would be most affected by the pipeline
shutdown, however, were slow to react to the news with West
Texas Sour and Alaska North Slope holding 50 cts to one dlr a
barrel below WTI, respectively.
    Dan Stevens, manager of public and government affairs at
Texaco, said the company hopes to fix the pipeline in five days
but that will depend on when the water level of the Red River
recedes. There is already evidence that the water level is
dropping and it appears the rain has stopped in the area
affecting the pipeline, Stevens said.
    He said the segment of the pipeline that was damaged was
underground and at a distance from the Red River that flooded.
The pipeline runs over the Red River and under the subsoil
nearby, according to Stevens. He said some of this subsoil was
apparently washed away.
   
    The potential for environmental damage is being downplayed
at this time despite the volume of oil that runs through this
line.
    Texaco's Stevens said that aerial surveillance has not
found any crude on the water in the river or in Lake Texoma,
which is nearby.

at home to deal with a new energy crisis.
    Synar, Democrat of Oklahoma, made his remarks in comments
on a study by the General Accounting Office (GAO) on the U.S.
participation in the 1985 test of the emergency oil sharing
program of the International Energy Agency.
    The IEA, an alliance of 21 oil consuming countries, was
formed after the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo to find ways to deal
with any future oil cutoff.
    Synar said, "the president is prepared to take military

take less dangerous, equally-important action to prepare our
nation for the next energy crisis."
    Reagan said the U.S. military would protect Kuwaiti oilers
to assure the West of a continuing supply of Middle East oil,
increasingly being threatened by the Iranian-Iraqi war. Synar,

18 and 20 dlrs a barrel will remain stable over the next couple
of years, rising only one to two dlrs a barrel per annum to

    Lukman, who was speaking during talks with Swedish trade

by both OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers, Swedish government
officials said.
    They said Lukman, who is also Nigerian oil minister, made
the remarks whilst talking about the connection between Third
World debt and industrialised nations.
    Crude oil output controls did not necessarily mean higher
energy bills for the world's industrial nations, Lukman said.
    Although very low oil prices, such as those seen around the
beginning of the year, may appear beneficial for the industrial
countries that depend on imported energy, they would only lead
to wastage and overdependence on the fuel in the long term, he
said.
    This in turn would bring a swing back to extremely high
prices, he added.

pipeline, shutdown because of flood damage, said it may be
several days before repairs are made and the system is

    Dan Stevens, manager of public and government affairs at
Texaco Inc <TX>, operator of the pipeline through its
subsidiary Texaco Pipeline Co, said the company hopes repairs
will begin in about five days and expects it to take several
more days to complete.
    "At this point we are lining up what we know we need, to get
the job done," Stevens said, adding that the timing for repairs
will depend on the damage to the pipeline which is difficult to
assess because of flooding on the Red River.
    The pipeline was shipping roughly 225,000 barrels of crude
oil per day, or about 55 pct of its capacity during the 30 days
preceding its shutdown on Saturday, Stevens said.
    The pipeline was shut down from Cushing, Okla, to Witchita

price-setter in the oil market following last year's price war,
acting OPEC Secretary General Fadhil al-Chalabi said.
    But he said he expects no short-term rise in demand for
OPEC oil, adding that market stability will mean a continued
sacrifice for the 13 OPEC member countries.
    Al-Chalabi, speaking at a university here yesterday, said
the December 1986 conference at which OPEC set an 18 dlr per
barrel reference price gave the market a signal that the
producers' group was serious.
    "It (OPEC) has no choice but to defend the price and this
has restored its credibility," said al-Chalabi, who is in
Caracas for a meeting of the OPEC Fund Board of Governors.
    Al-Chalabi said OPEC members have not exceeded the
production quotas which took effect on February 1 and spot
market prices are now near or above official OPEC prices.
    Before the December conference OPEC faced a major and basic
dilemma which led to the loss of its leadership role, he said.
"The question was, what should OPEC do? Defend the price and
risk losing its market share? Or defend its market share and
let the price drop?" he asked.
    "OPEC has chosen to stabilise the price. But the question is
how long will it be willing to keep up this painful exercise?" 
he said.
    Al-Chalabi said that despite OPEC's success in shoring up
prices and achieving discipline regarding quotas, he saw no
quick end to restraint in production.
    He also said he foresaw no increase in demand for OPEC oil
because increased non-OPEC production, combined with
conservation and the use of alternative energy sources, has
caused changes in the market which will not easily be reversed.

prices assigned to their crude oil but this should not pose
great problems when the group reviews its six-month-old price
and output pact in Vienna next week, oil analysts say.
    They said Nigeria, which holds the OPEC conference
presidency, and Qatar probably have the biggest grievances
about price differentials making some of their crudes
uncompetitive.
    There has also been speculation by Japanese traders that
OPEC might want to mark up prices of high-sulphur heavy crudes,
to correspond with greater demand and higher fuel oil prices.
    But most experts agree that a major overhaul of price
differentials is unlikely, so as to avoid giving the market
signals of a dent in OPEC's new unity.
    "All OPEC members can make a good case for changing
differentials," said one analyst with a major oil company. "But
at the end of the day, the attitude is going to be "leave well
alone' and little or nothing is likely to be altered."
    Iran, Libya and Saudi Arabia are among those who also saw
sales problems earlier this year, traders say. But diminished
customer resistance to fixed prices and, in some cases,
marketing incentives have helped their sales.
    Some producers can sell uncompetitively priced crudes by
means of discounts, processing deals or selling them alongside
better priced grades in a "package."
    Many OPEC crudes are seen to be reasonably priced, at least
for some part of the year. But many experts say OPEC should
change prices quarterly or monthly to match seasonal demand for
fuel oil-rich heavy crudes and gasoline-rich lighter grades. At
its last meeting in December, OPEC agreed to reintroduce fixed
prices from February 1 around an 18 dlr per barrel reference
point. Official prices had been effectively dropped in 1985
when members offered discounts to attract customers.
    OPEC also decided to limit first-half 1987 output to 15.8
mln bpd and proposed ceilings of 16.6 mln for the third quarter
and 18.3 mln for the fourth. Analysts expect it will now extend
or raise slightly the current ceiling for the coming months.
    Spot market and netback values for some crudes do not
mirror official prices, but OPEC will probably keep the 18 dlr
target and at most make minimal changes to differentials,
analysts say.
    The 18 dlr figure is based on a basket of six OPEC and one
non-OPEC crudes. OPEC assigned prices to its other key export
crudes, with a 2.65 dlr gap between the heaviest and lightest.
Extra heavy crudes were among those left out.
    Industry estimates vary on the proportion of OPEC oil
exports actually sold at official prices. Several experts say
only one-quarter to one-third of the total in fact sells at
official prices, with some of the rest included in processing
or barter deals or sold in the form of refined products.
    Problems with the new structure appeared earlier this year,
when some producers' output fell due to customer reluctance to
pay the new prices.
   Nigeria especially found its gasoline-rich Bonny Light crude
-- now OPEC's highest priced grade at 18.92 dlrs a barrel --
was uncompetitive on the spot market against Britain's Brent.
    In February and March, Nigeria's production shrank below
its 1.238 mln bpd OPEC quota. Spot prices have since revived,
due partly to seasonal demand for gasoline, and its output has
risen.
    Some experts feel Bonny Light is still overvalued and say
its price should be cut by between 50 cts to one dlr a barrel.
    But Mehdi Varzi, chief oil analyst with London's Kleinwort
Grieveson Securities, doubts Nigeria will actively push the
differentials question in Vienna.
    "It would not look good for OPEC unity if Nigeria, which
holds the presidency, raised the issue," he said.

by Rio Tinto-Zinc Corp Plc's <RTZL.L> RTZ Oil and Gas Ltd unit
and ruled that the financial provisions a company makes for the
future cost of abandoning an oil field are not tax deductible,
the Press Association reported.
    The company was appealing against a decision of the Tax
Commissioners that any such provision was a capital
expenditure, not a revenue expenditure, and was not deductible.
The court was told that since 1976 the company had made an
annual provision of around 750,000 stg for the eventual cost of
abandoning a rig.
    An RTZ spokesman said the ruling was not worrying as the
subsidiary had assumed that the provisions were not deductible
from corporation tax payable.
    It would have been a bonus if the company had won but all
budgeting had been on the assumption that it would not, he
said.
    Oil analysts said that RTZ's assumption of liability was
shared by the industry as a whole.
    The ruling appeared to mean that tax relief on the
expensive process of abandoning rigs would apply when the
expense occurred, not when provisions for future expenses were
built into the accounts, one analyst added.

to renew its one-year contract with Abu Dhabi for 480,000
tonnes of Upper Zakum crude oil, CPC officials told Reuters.
    They said CPC made the recommendation to the cabinet and is
now awaiting its approval.
    CPC's one-year contract with Abu Dhabi expired on May 31
this year and it wants the renewed contract to begin on June 1
at the government selling price. Delivery will be determined in
the course of the year. Last year, shipments were in three
parcels of 120,000 tonnes each and four of 30,000 tonnes each.
    CPC officials also said the company agreed with the
Egyptian government for the supply of 240,000 tonnes of Gulf of
Suez crude for delivery in two shipments this year at the
government selling price.
    Last year, CPC bought 120,000 tonnes Gulf of Suez through
C.Itoh.
    Officials said plans to buy 240,000 tonnes of Basra Light
from Iraq have not been finalised yet because of several
constraints. CPC said it could not accept 120,000 tonne parcels
and proposed to lift 30,000 tonnes in eight shipments.
    Iraq National Oil Co (INOC) told CPC a Red Sea port where
lifting was to take place could not accept small ships. INOC
then proposed to deliver eight shipments of 30,000 tonnes each.
    CPC said INOC planned to ship the oil to an Indian port for
delivery of Indian requirements, later going to Colombo to
offload CPC's needs, but CPC considered this unsuitable.
    CPC said it had not received a reply from INOC since
December. Sri Lanka imports all its annual needs of 1.7 mln
tonnes. This year it plans to buy 400,000 tonnes on the spot
market compared with about 1.3 mln tonnes last year.

said he expects next week's ministerial meeting in Vienna to be
brief and calm and that OPEC's current price and production
agreement may only need a slight review.
    "I expect the meeting in Vienna to be short and calm,"
Lukman, who is also Nigerian oil minister, told reporters here
ahead of his departure on Sunday for the conference, which
starts June 25.
    "We already have an agreement which may need only a slight
review," Lukman said.
    The agreement reached at a long session of OPEC ministers
in December last year pegged the group's crude oil output at
15.8 mln bpd for first half 1987 at fixed prices of around 18
dlrs a barrel.
    Since then prices have risen from 15 dlrs in December to
just above the official OPEC levels, with oil industry analysts
firmly convinced the organisation will maintain the agreement
to keep the market stable.
    "I myself believe that OPEC will tend to take a position to
strengthen the gains we have made so far," Lukman said.
    He declined to say if the current ceiling should be
maintained or raised to 16.6 mln bpd for the third quarter and
18.3 mln for the fourth as provisionally agreed last December.
    "Whatever decision we arrive at will be guided by our
collective will to keep the market strong," he said.
    He said non-OPEC member Norway, which he visited two weeks

was significant for its members.
    Lukman said heavy destocking by consumers early this year

highest level in more than a year ahead of next week's OPEC
meeting, even though most industry analysts do not expect any
policy changes from the session.
    They said prices, which have steadily climbed since the
organization's accord in December, have risen on technical
factors within the market and concerns about supplies because
of the Iran-Iraq war, which could disrupt deliveries from the
Gulf.
    The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate is trading
around 20.55 dlrs in the July contract on New York Mercantile
Exchange's energy futures and in the spot market. That is its
highest level since January 1986.
    OPEC conference president Rilwanu Lukman, who is Nigeria's
oil minister, said Friday he expects the meeting in Vienna to
be brief and calm and that OPEC's current price and production
agreement may only need a slight review.
    Although most industry experts expect just a reaffirmation
of the December agreement, oil prices continue to climb due to
a desire to hedge positions in case of any surprises.
    Analysts expect the higher prices to continue until soon
after the OPEC meeting. At that point, barring any increased
tension in the Gulf or changes in OPEC's policies, prices
should begin easing.
    "OPEC will probably not do anything it hasn't already agreed
to in December because oil prices are firm," said John Hill, a
vice president at Merrill Lynch Futures.
    OPEC agreed in December to maintain official oil prices at
18 dlrs a barrel and raise the group's production ceiling to
16.6 mln barrels per day in the third quarter and to 18.3 mln
barrels in the fourth quarter.
    This agreement helped send prices sharply higher, rising
from 15 dlrs a barrel in early December.
    Several OPEC members who are price hawks, including Iran,
Algeria and Libya, will seek a higher official price and a
reduction in output.
    "And if U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude continues to
trade above 20 dlrs a barrel, there is a greater chance that
OPEC will raise its official 18 dlrs price," said Nauman
Barakat, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co.
    But most analysts expect the more moderate producers, such
as Saudi Arabia, to block any changes in policy.
    "The meeting will be a non-event with no change in the
official prices because OPEC, and in particular the Saudis, are
committed to stabilizing the market," said Rosario Ilacqua,
analyst with L.F. Rothschild.
    However, some analysts said OPEC may need to hold a meeting
in September to re-evaluate market conditions.
    Overproduction by OPEC will become a real problem in the
fourth quarter when the quota is raised to 18.3 mln barrels a
day and Iraq's pipeline through Turkey brings another 500,000
barrels to the market each day, said John Lichtblau, president
of Petroleum Industry Ressearch Foundation.
    Most expect Saudi Arabia to oppose a price increase at this
meeting but many look for an increase by year-end to 20 dlrs to
offset the decline in the dollar. Oil prices are denominated
throughout the world in dollars, so as the currency declines,
producers receive less money for their oil.
    "The only real production restraint in OPEC is Saudi Arabia,"
said Sanford Margoshes, analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers.
    "In the second half of the year we expect the Saudis not to
produce at their 4.1 mln barrel a day quota and therefore act
as a vehicle to stablize the market and pave the way for a two
dlrs a barrel price increase at the December 1987 meeting," he
said.
    One uncertain factor is the course of the Iran-Iraq war.
    "The wild card is the increased tensions in the Persian
Gulf," said Frank Knuettel, analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securites.
    Oil tankers taking oil from Iraq and Kuwait have been
regular targets for Iranian planes. The Reagan administration
is planning to put Kuwait tankers under the protection of the
U.S. flag, with naval escorts.
    "Extra (oil) inventories are needed during a time of crisis
like this, and just general nervousness over an incident that
could disrupt oil supplies drives prices up," Knuettel said.

    Under a 1985 agreement with the now-defunct U.S. Synthetic

the oil shale plant. In return the company would have been
eligible for 500 mln dlrs in loan gaurantees and price supports
from the U.S. Treasury Department, which took over the contract
from the Synthetic Fuels Corp, Unocal said.
    Unocal said its studies showed the cost for the fluidized

compared with an original estimate of 260 mln dlrs.
    The fluidized bed facility would have provided heat and
electricity for the oil shale project, Unocal said.
    Last year's fall in oil prices and the loss of investment
tax credit under the Tax Reform Act made the project
uneconomical even with government price supports and loan

mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of the year should boost
spot prices and enable the group to raise its official
reference price to 20 dlrs a barrel in January from the current
18 dlrs, Far East oil industry sources said.
    "Fundamentally, the market situation is bullish and the
official price will be 20 dlrs in January," a Japanese refiner
said.
    The sources said that in spite of over-production by OPEC
members such as Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and
Qatar, demand should exceed supply by the fourth quarter.
    Spot oil prices surged on Friday in late U.S. Trading as
the market anticipated an OPEC agreement on second-half 1987
output. In early Tokyo trade, levels were firm at 17.30 dlrs
for Mideast Dubai cargoes loading next month and 19.00 dlrs for
U.K. Brent, traders said.
    They said they expect more foreign crudes to be sucked into
the U.S. Market as the benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate
(WTI) trades at around 20.30 dlrs.
    "With WTI at 20, 21 or 22 dlrs, U.S. Refiners will import
Mideast and Far East crudes and this will strengthen those
grades further," said a Japanese oil trader.
    Some Tokyo traders were cautious about whether thU spot
market has further upward potential in the short term, having
risen strongly on the OPEC news on Friday.
    "You could certainly argue that if New York rose on that
basis, there's no reason for prices to go up again today," said
one international oil trader in Tokyo.
    "But I think if there's any sign of a dip, it will be bought
back up again pretty quickly," he added.
    One oil industry analyst concurred, "There is no reason to
expect a weak market from now on." He said he expected OPEC to
raise prices to 20 dlrs when it meets on December 9.
    Oil sources said spot prices are unlikely to surge strongly
in the next few months due to cheating by some OPEC members and
the likelihood that Saudi Arabia will act as swing producer to
maintain steady prices.
    Iraq is currently producing around two mln barrels per day
compared to its second-half quota of 1.54 mln, they said. Its
export capability will rise to 2.5 mln bpd when a new pipeline
through Turkey, comes onstream in or around September.
    Qatar is said to be achieving sales of around 350,000 bpd,
against its OPEC-assigned quota of 299,000, by discounting up
to 20 cents a barrel from official prices, the sources said.
    Iran, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait are also cheating
on the OPEC agreement with over-production and effective price
discounts through counter-purchases, industry sources said. But
they mostly agreed that Saudi Arabia will unofficially act as
swing producer, cutting production to compensate for higher
output by other members or boosting output if spot prices rise
too high too fast.
    Saudi Arabia has a floating oil stockpile of 40 to 50 mln
barrels. "Saudi Arabia wants oil price stability so the
stockpile may be utilized to cool down the market if it rises
too much," an oil industry analyst said.

state-owned oil company, Petromin, Jamal Hassan Jawa, has
retired at his own request, oil industry sources said.
    They said Ali Ibrahim Rubaishi, head of organisation
planning in Petromin, would take over as acting governor.
    Jawa held the post since his predecessor, Abdul-Hadi Taher,
left in a major oil industry shake up last December.
    The sources said Rubaishi had not been expected to hold the
post permanently.
    The government removed Taher and Oil Minister Ahmed Zaki
Yamani from their posts late last year in a move which industry
sources said was aimed at coming to grips with a buyers' oil
market.
    The two men had run the Saudi oil industry for more than 20
years. Industry sources said that despite huge resources, Saudi
Arabia had been unable to mould an oil marketing strategy tuned
to the competitive realities of the 1980s glut.
    Hisham Nazer, who replaced Yamani, successfully led an
OPEC-engineered return to fixed oil prices of 18 dlrs a barrel
last December.
    Nazer is believed to be reviewing Saudi oil operations
which could lead to a thorough overhaul in the way Saudi Arabia
does business, the sources said.
    The sources had said possible candidates for the governor's
job include Prince Abdul Aziz Ibn Salman Ibn Abdul Aziz, who
earlier ran a research center at Saudi Arabia's University of
Petroleum and Minerals, and former Deputy Planning Minister
Faisal Beshir. They also list Abdulla Bakr, President of the

planned North Sea oil output in support of OPEC from July 15
until the end of this year, Oil Ministry spokesman Egil Helle
told Reuters.
    "We took a very positive view of the OPEC meeting in Vienna,"
he said. "The accord reached there means stability in the oil
market and we shall continue making our contribution."
    The cuts, originally brought in from February 1, would
probably be officially approved on July 10 by parliament, Helle
said. The ministry had written to Norway's oil companies and
would now discuss with them how best to implement the cuts.
    OPEC agreed this weekend in Vienna on an output ceiling of
16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of 1987 and
retained the fixed prices that were set in its December accord
based on an 18 dlr per barrel reference point.
    OPEC's first half 1987 output ceiling was 15.8 mln bpd, and
it's December pact had provisionally set a third quarter
ceiling of 16.6 mln bpd, rising to 18.3 mln in the fourth
quarter.
    Norway, which pumps around one mln bpd from its offshore
fields, previously said it would continue its output curbs from
planned production for the rest of the year if OPEC remained
within its December accord on output and prices.
    Norway's oil production rose 10 pct to an average of around
840,000 bpd in 1986. Since then it has risen to around one mln
bpd, and is expected to reach about 1.5 mln bpd by 1995.
    The 7.5 pct cut from planned production implemented since
February reduced Norway's oil output by about 80,000 bpd.
    Norway's Oil Minister Arne Oeien, currently in Iceland for
a meeting of Nordic ministers, has made no official statement
on the latest oil production cutbacks.
    Over the past year several other leading non-OPEC
producers, including the Soviet Union, Mexico, China, Malaysia
and Egypt have also pledged support for OPEC's bid to keep
prices stable.
    Norway decided on the initial round of cuts following an
OPEC agreement last December which boosted oil prices to around
18 dlrs per barrel from around 14 to 15 dlrs last December.
    Norway relies on oil for about 40 pct of its total export
earnings and was hit hard by the collapse in the oil price
during the first half of 1986.
    But firmer oil prices since then have brought some
stability to the economy and helped narrow the foreign trade
deficit.
     Norway's North Sea neighbour Britain has consistently
refused to cooperate with OPEC output cuts saying it is up to
the producing oil companies to set the levels of production.

communique issued at the conclusion of the OPEC conference
here.
    "The conference expressed satisfaction about the positive
results of the agreement signed in December, 1986, by which
OPEC re-established the system of fixed price at a level of 18
dlrs per barrel supported by OPEC production ceilings
distributed into national production levels.
    "The conference noted that all market indicators, including
spot prices in the market and netback values of all OPEC
crudes, have been firming up significantly, thus consolidating
the OPEC price structure as defined by the agreement."
    "The conference examined the supply/demand outlook for the
second half of the year and decided that in order to secure
continued firm prices in the market, OPEC production during the
fourth quarter of 1987 will be equal to that of the third
quarter, I.E. 16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd), distributed into
the same national production levels as were defined by the
above-mentioned agreement for that quarter."
    "Furthermore, the conference decided to establish a
committee of five heads of delegation to monitor the price
evolution in the market in relation to the OPEC official prices
in order to secure price stability around the opec price
structure.
    "Should there be any significant change in market prices,
the committee would immediately call for an extraordinary
meeting of the conference with a view to deciding on the
necessary OPEC production levels during the second half of the
year, which would secure the desired market stability."
    "The conference reiterated the necessity of member
countries' strict adherence to the agreement signed in December
1986, both in terms of official price, and national production,
levels.
    "For this purpose, the conference decided to establish a
committee of three heads of delegation to undertake visits to
member countries in order to motivate them to comply with the
terms of the agreement."

    "Moreover, the conference stressed the necessity of the
cooperation of the oil-producing exporting countries outside
OPEC as an essential prerequisite for a lasting market
stability.
    The conference, therefore, decided to reinstate the group
of five heads of delegation established by the 77th
(extraordinary) meeting of the conference in April, 1986 to
undertake the necessary contacts with those countries.
    "The conference observed the continued fall in the value of
the U.S. Dollar and agreed that the matter should be studied
and reported to the next meeting of the conference."

    "The conference discussed the appointment of the secretary
general and decided to discuss the matter again in its next
ordinary meeting.
    "The conference extended the term of office of Fadhil
al-Chalabi as deputy secretary general for a period of one year

including that of Iraq, will be above the official 16.6 mln
barrels per day (bpd) output ceiling agreed by OPEC Saturday,
Kuwait oil minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah, said.
    Iraq refused to sign the pact, by which OPEC maintained its
ceiling at 16.6 mln bpd for both the third and fourth quarters
of 1987. In December, OPEC set a provisional fourth quarter
level of 18.3 mln bpd, now cut back to the third quarter
target.
    Ali told a news conference that including Iraq, "OPEC third
quarter output will be between 17.5 and 17.7 mln bpd while
fourth quarter output will be nearly 18 mln bpd"
    Ali did not detail what effect he thought these production
levels would have on prices.
    Iraq has an official first half quota of 1.466 mln bpd,
rising to 1.54 mln in the second half, but has refused to
adhere to it and has recently been producing around two mln
barrels per day, exporting it through pipelines to Saudi Arabia
and Turkey. Iraq's export capacity will be further boosted when
a 500,000 bpd oil pipeline via Turkey comes on stream in about
September.
    Iraq has been insisting on a quota equal to its Gulf War
enemy Iran, which has a quota of 2.255 mln bpd, rising to 2.369
mln in the second half.
    Ali said the position of the 400,000 bpd production from
the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, which has
been supplied to Iraq as war relief crude, was fixed. "We will
not discuss it. There will not be any change," he said.
    Ali said the conference, which began Thursday and ended
Saturday evening, had been too short for all necessary problems
to be adressed. "We are overdoing it in holding too short a
meeting. We sweep a lot under the carpet," he said.
    Ali said the problem of price differentials between the
prices of various OPEC crudes had not been dealt with properly
at the meeting.

    Ali said "The problem of differentials is a real one. I
would hate to be producing today a light crude and that problem
has not been dealt with properly. Light crudes are overpriced
relative to heavy crudes."
    Asked if the issue of differentials would be raised at the
next OPEC meeting to be held in Vienna on December 9, Ali said
"If my crudes are affected I will raise the issue, I will not do
the work of another minister."
    Kuwait's own crudes range from medium to heavy grades.
    OPEC reintroduced fixed prices on February 1, with a spread
of 2.65 dlrs a barrel between its lightest and heaviest crudes.

Corp's <CHV> Chevron Exploration North Sea Ltd may indicate a
new field with recoverable crude oil reserves of 300 mln
barrels, industry analysts said.
    Chevron said a sidetrack well on block 16/26 on the U.K.
Continental shelf tested 9,000 barrels per day (bpd) of 20 API
crude oil from the tertiary "Alba" sand through a three-inch
surface choke.
    "The estimated amount of oil at the Alba field is around 320
mln barrels," Paul Spedding of stockbroker Kleinwort Grieveson
and Co told Reuters.
    He said industry estimates put the total reserves at the
field at over one billion barrels, but given the low gravity of
oil, the recovery rate would be expected to be around 20-25
pct.
    Analysts said the results were encouraging, but the
potential difficulty of operating and recovering oil in the
field was shown by the fact that the first well had to be
plugged and a sidetrack drilled.
    "The field seems to be shallow and widespread, which will
require a multi-platform development in recovery, pushing costs
up," Christopher Osborne of stockbroker Hoare Govett said.
    Most analysts said that although the low gravity of the oil
found would require additional costs in recovery, the test well
showed that it flows well.
    "Although the gravity of oil at the field seems to be low,
it seems to flow quite well and around 300 mln barrels could be
recovered," Carol Bell of Phillips and Drew told Reuters.
    However, Chevron officials declined to comment on the
analysts' reserve estimates. They said that without further
research and drilling in the area this summer, they would not
disclose any reserve figures.
    Analysts said that if the field were declared commercial
and developed, there would be a ready local market for the
heavy crude it produced.
    "Most refineries are now upgraded to refine heavy oils and
the price differentials between heavy and light crudes are a
lot narrower today," Osborne said.
    Chevron operates the block on behalf of 16 companies which
include British Petroleum Development Ltd, DSM Hydrocarbons
(UK) Ltd, Enterprise Oil (TNS) Ltd, Marathon Int. Pet. (GB) Ltd
and Phillips Petroleum Co U.K. Ltd.

produce during the past few months," he said.
    Earthquake damage to a pipeline sharply cut Ecuadorean
production from March to May this year.
    Santos said the move had been explained to fellow OPEC
members during last week's meeting in Vienna, when an increase
in Ecuador's quota to 221,000 bpd from 210,000 was approved.
    "They understood our position and we believe we remain
within the spirit of the (quota) agreement," he said.
    Immediately before the March quake Ecuadorean production
was 250,000-260,000 bpd, with 144,000 bpd exported.
    While its production was down, Venezuela, Nigeria and
Kuwait loaned Ecuador a total 12 mln barrels of crude and four
mln barrels of products, Santos said.

despite the U.S. Attack against Iranian oil platforms and
growing tension in the Gulf, Venezuelan Energy Minister Arturo
Hernandez Grisanti said on Monday.
    He described the situation as "extremely tense," but said
Gulf military activity would not significantly affect prices
because supply and demand were roughly equal.
    Demand for OPEC crude in the final quarter of 1987 was 18.5
mln barrels per day (bpd) and the group's members were now
pumping above 18 mln bpd, he told a news conference.
    Hernandez Grisanti said the supply/demand balance was
precarious and prices were in danger of falling from their
current average of about 18 dlrs per barrel if overproduction
continued.
    Three or four members of the 13-nation Organisation of
Petroleum Exporting Countries were "overproducing in an
exaggerated manner" above their assigned quotas, he said.
    OPEC's overall ceiling is 16.6 mln bpd.

Tuesday it will extend contracts on producing blocks and
improve the investment climate, but wants to see increased
expenditure on exploration in return.
    President Suharto, in an opening speech to the Indonesian
Petroleum Association, said Indonesia was ready to extend
contracts held by foreign oil companies on producing areas.
    "In order to boost investment in the petroleum industry, the
government of Indonesia has basically approved of extending
production sharing contracts under the present laws," Suharto
said.
    "Apart from that, the government will keep improving the
investment climate in order to accelerate the development of
the petroleum industry," he said.
    Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto told the Association he
was aware that the oil industry needed to be assured that
contracts on blocks expiring within the next 10 years would be
renewed before they would invest in further exploration.
    "As we all have heard this morning, the President is fully
aware of this situation," Subroto said.
    "The government has already made the political decision to
entertain this time problem by inviting the existing producers
to continue their activities in Indonesia, albeit on a
selective basis."
    Indonesia, one of the 13 members of OPEC, must find new oil
reserves if it is to remain an exporter in the next decade, oil
industry sources say.
    Subroto said the government was also working to ease other
problems, including granting easier terms for remote areas or
deep water conditions.
    But Subroto said relations with oil companies were two-way
and that they should step up expenditure on oil exploration now
that the oil price had recovered.
    President Suharto said he wanted to see greater transfer of
technology to Indonesian companies, and more help from the oil
industry for the regions in which companies operated.
    Abdul Rachman Ramly, the President of state oil company
Pertamina, has said that budgeted exploration and production
expenditure for all oil companies in Indonesia was forecast to
fall to 3.1 billion dlrs in calendar 1987 from 3.4 billion in
1986.
    Pertamina has 69 production-sharing or joint operation
contracts with foreign oil companies.
    Subroto said speeding up necessary approvals for field
operations was a government priority. There had been
misunderstandings between the government and the oil industry
in certain areas, such as when a field is designated
commercial, and a thorough evaluation was being made.
    He said the government wanted to finalise contract
extensions as soon as practical, and urged the industry in the
meantime to maintain its exploration drive.
    Subroto said Indonesia needed the companies to maintain
exploration efforts, even if their contract was due to expire
within 10 years. "This need in itself is some sort of guarantee
that we will soon have to come up with an extension agreement."
    Eleven major contract areas are due to come up for renewal
between 1991 and 2001, industry sources said.
    Extension of the contracts on the blocks has involved
detailed negotiations but so far no extension has been granted.
    Subroto told reporters afterwards that contract extensions
would be selective, based on how much capital would be
invested.

pct to 1.07 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 830,492 bpd in
August, according to a Reuter survey of firms operating here.
    Operators said the sharp rise reflected higher output at
several of Norway's biggest fields and resumed production at
fields shut down for 27 days in August for the Ekofisk field
rescue project.
    Industry analysts said the increase did not exceed Norway's
voluntary move to curb by 7.5 pct planned growth in its oil
output, a move designed to back OPEC-led efforts to stabilise
oil prices by limiting supplies to world crude markets.
    Norway, not an OPEC member, decided in June to extend the
production restraints, enforced since February 1 1987, on all
its North Sea fields for the rest of the year.
    Oil Minister Arne Oeien said last month he expected Norway
would extend into 1988 its policy of slowed production growth.
    The biggest increase was seen on the Ekofisk field, which
pumped 168,023 bpd in September against 48,195 bpd in August,
field operator Phillips Petroleum Norway Inc said.
    Ekofisk and the nearby Valhall and Ula fields, which use
the Ekofisk pipeline, were shut down for most of August while
Phillips raised Ekofisk platforms to counter seabed subsidence.
    BP Petroleum Development Norway Ltd, operator of the Ula
field, said September output rose to 86,727 bpd after dropping
to 27,237 bpd in August because of the shutdown.
    Valhall, operated by Amoco Norway A/S, flowed 74,694 bpd
last month compared with 69,748 bpd in August, the company
said.
    September production was also sharply higher at the
Statfjord field. Norway's 84 pct share of Statfjord, which
extends into the British North Sea sector, was 611,138 bpd
against 552,646 bpd in August, operator Den Norske Stats
Oljeselskap A/S (Statoil) said.
    Norway's 22.2 pct share of the Murchison field which, like
Statfjord, extends into the British sector, yielded 15,388 bpd
in September, a slight 920 bpd decrease from the previous
month, Norwegian partners on the British-operated field said.
    Statoil boosted output at its Gullfaks field to 109,670 bpd
in September, compared with 100,188 in August.
    Norsk Hydro, operator of the Oseberg field, said test
output at the field from the mobile production ship Petro Jarl
totalled 1,719 bpd last month, down sharply from 16,170 bpd in
August.
    Hydro said the drop was caused by failure to bring on
stream a second well, cutting September production to just two
days.

has been set at 625 mln tonnes, a rise of eight mln tonnes over

    He said a new development strategy, fuller use of oil
deposits and better housing and pay for oilmen had allowed an

which began in late 1983.
    Last year the Soviet Union produced 615 mln tonnes of oil,

Iran's Silkworm missiles as a target in the retaliatory attack
mounted on Monday for fear of being drawn more deeply into the
Iran-Iraq war, defense and Middle East experts said.
    U.S. naval forces destroyed an offshore oil platform and
raided another in what the administration called a "measured and
appropriate response" to an Iranian Silkworm missile attack last
Friday on a U.S.-flagged tanker in Kuwaiti waters.
    Private analysts generally agreed that going after the rig
rather than an onshore economic or military target such as
Silkworm launch sites reflected a careful bid by Washington to
limit the political, military and diplomatic fallout both at
home and in the Gulf.
    "It simply demonstrated the United States will take military
action when they (Iran) take military action," Norman Polmar, a
defense analyst and author, said.
    He said hitting the platforms had spared Iran the
embarrassment of casualties on its own soil, possibly avoiding
an escalating spiral of attack and counterattack.
    In addition, it minimized the risk to U.S. forces and the
potential embarrassment of any losses, including aircraft that
could have been shot down had they taken part in an attack.
    Anthony Cordesman, author of a new book on the Iran-Iraq
war, said the United States apparently chose a limited target
to keep alive the possibility that U.N. Secretary General
Javier Perez de Cuellar might still persuade Iran to accept a
Security Council call for a ceasefire.
    "We want the U.N. peace initiative to work if there's any
chance at all," he said, adding that the action made it clear
tougher steps would follow if Iran to attack Gulf shipping.

   In targeting an oil rig -- albeit one said by the Pentagon
to have been turned into a military command post -- Washington
also sent a message that it might be willing to attack Iran's
economic lifeline. Pentagon officials said the platform had
been used as a base for Iranian raids against shipping in the
lower Gulf.
    "We have chosen a military target, but we also have shown
Iran that we are willing to interfere with its oil-exporting
capabilities," Cordesman said.
    He predicted the United States would respond to any future
major Iranian challenges by hitting Iran's naval base at Bandar
Abbas on the Straits of Hormuz, followed by mining the
approaches to Iran's oil export terminal on Kharg Island.
    Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said on Monday the
United States did not seek further confrontation with Iran, "but
we will be prepared to meet any escalation of military action
by Iran with stronger countermeasures."

the lack of any major new discoveries in recent years will send
the world into an energy crisis by 1990, the former Atlantic
Richfield Co chairman Robert O. Anderson said.
    "It's going to come sooner than anyone thinks," Anderson
told reporters after addressing a Houston business lunch. "I
believe we're going to see a change in the world oil markets in
two to three years because oil is becoming harder to find."
    Anderson, who retired from Arco last year to form Hondo Oil
and Gas Co, said world oil consumption is approaching 60 mln
barrels a day but a current excess capacity cushion of about
4.5 mln barrels a day will rapidly disappear.
    "If you looked around the world, you could not scrape up
one mln barrels a day in shut-in production outside the Middle
East," he said. "We're soon going to be right back where we
were in 1973 and 1979."
    Anderson predicted that world oil prices would end 1987 at
about 24 dlrs a barrel and continue a gradual climb.
    "There's no way prices can stay flat because there isn't
enough supply," he said. "There have been no major oil
discoveries for the past 15 to 20 years."

world markets helped limit and then reverse oil price gains
that followed the U.S. Strike on an Iranian oil platform in the
Gulf earlier on Monday, analysts said.
    December loading rose to 19.65 dlrs, up 45 cents before
falling to around 19.05/15 later, unchanged from last Friday.
    "Fundamentals are awful," said Philip Lambert, analyst with
stockbrokers Kleinwort Grieveson, adding that total OPEC
production in the first week of October could be above 18.5 mln
bpd, little changed from September levels.
    Peter Nicol, analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank, said OPEC
production could be about 18.5-19.0 mln in October. Reuter and
International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates put OPEC September
production at 18.5 mln bpd.
    The U.S. Attack was in retaliation of last Friday's hit of
a Kuwaiti oil products tanker flying the U.S. Flag, the Sea
Isle City. It was struck by a missile, believed to be Iranian,
in Kuwaiti waters, and was the first hit on a U.S. Flag
commercial vessel in the seven year Iran/Iraq war.
    The U.S. Owned Liberian flag tanker Sungari was hit in the
area on Thursday, also believed struck by an Iranian missile.
    Refiners were not significant purchasers of physical oil on
Monday as a result increased Gulf tension following the U.S.
Attack, analysts said.
    They said a closure of the Strait of Hormuz, through which
around eight mln bpd passes, isnlikely because it is not in
the interests of the U.S. Or Iran, they said.
    Any threat to oil supplies would stem from an increase in
the number of tanker attacks as part of a widening of Gulf
hostilities, analysts said.
    But they saw the U.S. Strike as a limited reply to Iranian
missile attacks, with some describing it as responsible.
    Geoffrey Pyne, analyst at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew,
said he was impressed by the sensible U.S. Response.
    "The U.S. Has thought carefully about what would correspond
to Iranian agression. They have proved to the Iranians that any
further action will be met with a like-for-like response.
Today's action by the U.S. Was not escalatory," Pyne said.
    Kleinwort Grieveson's Lambert said the U.S. Strike was "a
responsible retaliation," with the U.S. Apparently indicating to
Iran that it could increase the severity of its attacksf Iran
chose to raise the level of conflict.
    Chase Manhattan's Nicol took a different view, however.
    He said he was unable to see what the U.S. Had achieved as
Arab states such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, whose interests
the U.S. Is supposedly defending, will feel less secure as a
result of the U.S. Attack and fear some sort of Iranian
retaliation.
    The initial upward market move this morning reflected a
strong speculative reaction to rumours of a U.S. Attack which
was thought at one stage to have been against Iranian missile
launchers on the Faw Peninsula, close to Kuwait, analysts said.
    The later downtrend followed confirmation of a U.S. Navy
attack on an Iranian oil platform by the U.S. Defence Secretary
Caspar Weinburger.
    Market operators were able to evaluate the situation in the
Gulf on the basis of confirmed fact, and finding it less
serious than first thought, took profits, taking prices lower,
analysts and traders said.

    Soviet officials have previously criticized the United
States for sending naval forces into the Gulf, saying their
presence serves to increase tension.
    Moscow is officially neutral in the war between Iran and
Iraq. It is a major arms supplier to Iraq but has also sought
broader contacts with Iran in the last year.
    Krutikhin said: "The United States has undertaken an act of
armed aggression against Iran, the probability of which has
long been spoken of by Washington officials."

pipeline system to be completed in 18-months time to start
exports at a initial rate of 100,000 barrels per day, (bpd) the
Middle East Economic Survey (MEES) said.
    MEES said government approval for the export pipeline
followed a visit to Aden by a high ranking delegation from the
Soviet Union, which will help South Yemen construct the line
    The engineering studies for the pipeline are nearly
finished and construction is expected to start early next year,
the industry newsletter said.
    The pipeline will run about 170-200 kms (105-125 miles)
from Shabwa oilfields to a coastal terminal at Bir 'Ali on the
Gulf of Aden, MEES said.
     MEES said the Soviet firm Technoexport, which is
developing oilfileds for South Yemen, has substantially
increased its initial reserve estimates and recommended a
pipeline with an eventual 500,000 bpd capacity.
    The discovery of commercial quaotities of oil was confirmed
by Technoexport earlier this year in three structures in the
Shabwa region in the Northwestern part of the country, 200 kms
east of North Yemen's Alif oilfield.

<STAT.OL>, operator on Norway's North Sea Veslefrikk oil field,
has placed field development contracts totalling 1.5 billion
crowns with two domestic yards, the company said in a
statement.
    Moss Rosenberg Verft, a subsidiary of Kvaerner Industrier
A/S <KVIO.OL> won a 1.2 billion crown contract to convert
Statoil's semisubmersible rig West Vision to a floating
production platform and to build the deck for a separate, fixed
well-head platform to be placed on the field, it said.
    Statoil said Aker Verdal, a unit of Aker Norcem A/S
<AMVO.OL>, won a 300-mln crown contract to design and build the
well-head platform's 10,000-tonne steel substructure, to stand
in 150 metres of water next to the converted rig.
    Statoil said using a floating production unit rather than a
fixed platform would cut construction time, enabling field
partners to bring Veslefrikk on stream in late 1989 -- several
months earlier than previously planned.
    Veslefrikk, with estimated recoverable reserves of 258 mln
barrels oil and 140 billion cubic feet gas, is located 145 km
west of Bergen.
    Statoil estimates the field's total development cost,
including drilling, at 6.6 billion crowns. Planned daily output
is 65,000 barrels oil and 35 mln cubic feet gas.
    Veslefrikk's oil will be landed via the nearby Oseberg
field pipeline at the Sture crude terminal near Bergen. Its gas
will be fed into the Statpipe line, which gathers gas from
Norway's Statfjord, Gullfaks and Oseberg fields.
    Partners on the field are Statoil, the operator, with a 55
pct share, <Unocal Norge A/S> (18 pct), <Deminex (Norge) A/S>
(13.5 pct), Norsk Hydro A/S <NHY.OL> (nine pct) and <Svenska
Petroleum AB> (4.5 pct).

Iran with refined oil products in exchange for 100,000 barrels
per day of crude, Iran's national news agency, IRNA, said.
    IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Oil Minister Gholamreza
Aqazadeh as saying on his return to Tehran from Moscow that the
agreement was part of a protocol on economic cooperation signed
during his visit. The amount of crude delivered to the Soviet
Union might double to 200,000 bpd later, he said.
    Aqazadeh said the two sides agreed to conduct feasibility
studies for a pipeline to take Iranian crude from fields in
southern Iran to the Black Sea through the Soviet Union.
    Iran is pursuing the pipeline project to protect part of
its oil exports from Iraqi air attacks in the Gulf.
    Irna made no mention of natural gas exports to the Soviet
Union, which Aqazadeh had said would be discussed before he
left for Moscow.
    Iran lost most of its refining capacity early in the Gulf
war and now imports several hundred thousand bpd of refined
products.
    Aqazadeh said Soviet refined products would be delivered at
the Caspian Sea ports of Anzali and Nowshahr, at Neka, near the
Caspian, and at Jolfa in north-west Iran.
