sugar import quota during the week ended January 9, the initial

to be 1.8 mln tonnes in calendar 1987, unchanged from 1986 and
below the government's 1987 forecast of 2.5 mln, the U.S.
Embassy said in its agricultural outlook for 1987.
    Indonesia bought 162,500 tonnes of raw sugar on world
markets in late 1986, the report said.
    The embassy estimated Indonesia's calendar 1986 raw sugar
production at 1.8 mln tonnes, against a government estimate of
1.99 mln.
    It said that Indonesia's move into sugar self-sufficiency
in 1984 may have been short-lived.
    The report said, "The government continues to promote
sugarcane production through its smallholder intensification
program and a relatively high guaranteed price to sugarcane
producers.
    "However, there are considerable indications that farmers
are reluctant to plant cane because its economic return is not
as good as that of other crops."

operators who have bought its sugar for shipment in March that
these contracts will take second place to Cuba's direct
shipments to its export markets, dealers here said.
    Some traders who have received telexes from Cuba said the
language of the message was not totally clear and some believed
shipments would be honoured if the traders declare the Soviet
Union as the destination of their contracts.
    The telexes have fueled rising world prices in the last
week and reflect a poor Cuban crop, worry over Brazil's export
availability, and increasing Soviet demand, analysts said.
    Traders said signs of Cuba's shortage of immediately
available raw sugar to supply its traditional martkets was
probably the factor behind Syria calling a snap buying tender
last month.
    Normally Syria calls white sugar buying tenders for forward
delivery, and last month's spot requirement resulted in the
sale of several cargoes.
    Cuba in its telex told operators they would not receive
March shipments as Cuba has to meet its contracts to export
markets, traders said.

    The company said the product, with the generic name of

about 600 times sweeter.
    It yields no calories and does not promote tooth decay.
    Johnson and Johnson said the sweetner is being jointly

    Tate and Lyle is seeking approval in Canada, the United
Kingdom and other European countries, Johnson and Johnson said.
The company noted its petition covering the product and its
safety evaluation were submitted to the FDA last month.
    While awaiting FDA approval, the company said, it is
proceeding with plans for commercialization through its McNeil
Specialty Products Co subsidiary.
    Johnson and Johnson said it is operating under a licensing
agreement with Tate and Lyle, whose collaborative research with
scientists at Queen Elizabeth College in London led to the

    Patents and licensing agreements control the use of
sucralose through the year 2001, Johnson and Johnson said.
    Sucralose is a chlorinated derivative of ordinary sugar.
The carbon-chloride bonds in sucralose are stable and are not
broken during digestion or metabolism.
    Sucralose is essentially not metabollized by the body. The
chlorine content enhances sweetness without providing calories.

beet in Europe is forecast to remain stagnant this year at 7.22
mln hectares compared with 7.21 mln ha in 1986, West German
statistician F.O. Licht said.
    It was feared that the recent steep rise in sugar prices
would have a marked effect on planting intentions this year,
Licht said, but judging by this first estimate the effect was
probably minimal.
    The total beet area in the European Community is forecast
to fall two pct to 1.85 mln ha against 1.89 mln in 1986.
    The total Western Europe area is put at 2.49 mln ha,
against 2.50 mln in 1986. Eastern Europe area is forecast at
4.73 mln ha against 4.72 mln.
    Individual West Europe country estimates, in 1,000 hectares
(with 1986 figures in brackets), are, Belgium/Luxembourg 114
(118), Denmark 69 (69), France 419 (421), Greece 35 (44),
Ireland 36 (38), Italy 270 (275), Netherlands 129 (138),

(196), East Germany 210 (205), Hungary 108 (96), Poland 460
(440), Romania 295 (280).
    On the basis of average yields this year, Licht said these
area forecasts pointed to a total European beet sugar crop in
1987/88 of 29.8 mln tonnes, raw value, down from 31.4 mln
tonnes in 1986/87. Licht said sugar yields were fairly high
last season, thanks to favourable weather, and this increases
the chances of a significant reduction in production in
1987/88.
    Based on average yields, EC beet sugar production could
fall nearly 10 pct this year to 13.5 mln tonnes from 14.9 mln
in 1986/87, while total Western Europe production could be 16.9

said this sugar was actually Belgian and was being offered by
the Belgian industry.
    "We sympathise with the actions of the French, West German
and Belgian traders and producers, but we are not party to it,"
a spokesman said.
    EC Commission sources said yesterday French traders planned
to sell 775,000 tonnes into intervention stocks, West German
traders 75,000 tonnes and Dutch traders 2,500. Dutch trade
sources gave the same figure for France, but estimated up to
110,000 tonnes offered by German traders and producers.
    The Dutch spokesman added, "The weekly export tender policy
and prices are squeezing the European sugar industry, and this
is the only way in which they can really register their
protest.
    "These are desperate actions, but we believe that most of
this offered sugar will be withdrawn within the three-week
breathing space allowed."

105,000 hectares of land this year compared with some 95,000 in
1986, the official MTI news agency said.
    Diplomats said this reflected Hungary's policy of keeping
the sugar beet area stable under the current five-year plan
(1985-89) and producing enough to cover only domestic demand
despite the recent rise of world prices to 10 month highs.
    Drought cut the 1986 harvest to 3.58 mln tonnes from 4.07
mln in 1985. But a record yield of 130 kilos per tonne of beet
kept production at 454,000 tonnes, with 30,000 extra refined in
Yugoslavia from Hungarian beet. Output was 483,000 in 1985.

sugar imports this year to cover falling domestic output and
rising demand, in view of market predictions that international
sugar prices will remain firm this year, traders and the
official press said.
    He Kang, Minister of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and
Fisheries, said this week that China has adjusted the
purchasing price for sugar cane and beet to check a drop in
production last year but he gave no price details.
    One Japanese trader said domestic demand is rising rapidly
because of improving living standards and rising demand for
sweet drinks, cakes and biscuits and other sugary foods.
    "It will not be easy to cut domestic demand, even in a
state-controlled economy. China may have to import," he said.
    Customs figures show imports fell to 1.182 mln tonnes in
1986 from 1.909 mln in 1985 and fell to 25,165 tonnes in
January 1987 from 54,000 in January 1986.
    The official Economic Information newspaper last month said
production in the 1986/87 crushing season (September-April)
will be 1.18 mln tonnes short of demand.
    The paper put 1986/87 output at 4.82 mln, down from 5.24
mln in 1985/86, and domestic demand at about six mln tonnes.
    "In the last two years, acreage under sugar cane and beet
has fallen, sugar mills are underutilised, output has dropped
and cannot meet demand that is rising every day," it said.
    "The country will have to continue imports of sugar and draw
down stocks to meet market demand," it added.
    It quoted the Ministry of Light Industry as blaming the
drop in output on unreasonable state purchasing prices for cane
and beet as against other crops, which has resulted in farmers
refusing to grow them.
    The paper said in 1985 a farmer could earn up to three
times more per hectare from pineapple and watermelon and up to
seven times more from bananas than from sugarcane. He could
sell grain on the free market at 560 yuan a tonne, against only
70 yuan a tonne for sugarcane.
    Sugar mills are suffering because refined sugar prices have
not changed for 20 years despite rising costs, it said.
    In Fujian, the cost of producing one tonne rose to 702 yuan
in 1985 from 520.1 in 1980, cutting the mills' profit to 117
yuan a tonne from 217.9, it added.
    The paper said unreasonable pricing resulted in 144 of the
442 sugar mills working in the 1985/86 crushing season losing
money. China has 521 sugar mills.
    A foreign agricultural expert forecast a drop in cane
acreage in 1986/87 (September-August) of up to 10 pct in
Guangdong, which produced 45 pct of China's sugar in calendar
1985, and a smaller drop in Fujian, which produced 11 pct of
China's sugar in calendar 1985.
    He said both provinces are more developed than other
sugar-producing areas and more sensitive to demand from cities.
    But cane acreage in Guangxi and Yunnan, which accounted for
28 pct of the 1985 crop, has risen by 10 to 30 pct in 1986/87,
because cane-growing is more economic there, he said.
    He put sugar stocks at 2.333 mln tonnes in September 1986.
    A Hong Kong trader estimated stocks at more than three mln
at end-January. "Now they are falling but (they) have not
reached the critical level, compelling China to import quickly,"
he said.
    "China has options not easily available in western
countries. It controls stocks strictly and can release less
into the consumer market if stocks fall too quickly," he said.
    The Hong Kong trader said calendar 1987 imports will be
slightly less than those of 1986, because of firm world prices
and serious foreign exchange constraints which, he said, are
likely to continue until at least end-1988.
    He said nearly all cane and beet is sold to the state-owned
mills, with a small amount sold raw to consumers.
    "Most of the mills are old and inefficient, with many of
them using Soviet equipment imported in the 1950s," he said.
    He said demand in rural areas will in future rise an annual
four pct, with demand in the cities rising an annual two pct.

suggest that this year's crop may be at least as large as last
year's 7.35 mln tonnes, according to sugar analysts.
    Exports in January totalled 733,000 tonnes raw value, up
from 725,000 a year earlier, according to figures received by
the International Sugar Organization.
    January is the first major export month and the figures
thus give a good indication of the current crop, they said.
Fourth quarter exports fell to 622,000 tonnes from 909,000
tonnes a year earlier, but this was because Cuba was destocking
at the end of 1985, they added.
    Trade house C Czarnikow recently estimated production this
year at 7.50 mln tonnes.
    Cuban sugar production in the third quarter of 1986 was
12,000 tonnes, giving a final 1985/86 crop total of 7.35 mln
tonnes, compared with a 1984/85 crop of 8.10 mln tonnes.
    There is normally no third quarter production in Cuba, but
a hurricane meant that last year's crop was extended.
    Exports to the USSR were substantially down in January at
362,000 tonnes from 489,000 in January 1986, but other Comecon
countries received 210,000 tonnes, against 80,000 tonnes in the
same month last year, figures received by the ISO show.
    Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Romania all took
substantially more Cuban sugar.
    Cuba's November 1986 exports totalled 158,000 tonnes,
compared with 190,000 tonnes in 1985, and December's total was
237,000 tonnes, down from 518,000 tonnes the year before.
Calendar year exports for 1986 were also lower at 6.69 mln
tonnes against 7.21 mln in 1985 -- the lowest level since
1980's 6.19 mln tonnes, the figures show.

 ]]></BODY><BODY><![CDATA[European sugar beet plantings are
expected to show little change from last year, despite recent
firmness in world prices, analysts and industry sources said.
    A Reuter survey of planting intentions showed that while,
so far, European Community (EC) growers plan unchanged to lower
areas, increases are expected in some Eastern European nations.
    Trade analysts said their private reports give similar
results and do not differ significantly from the first estimate
of stagnant 1987 European beet plantings made last week by West
German sugar statistician F. O. Licht.
    Areas may be slightly lower but analysts and agricultural
experts said the steady rise in yields resulting from improved
seed varieties and better farming techniques could offset this.
In recent years, good autumn weather has given yields a late
boost, making up for lower areas despite some disappointing
starts to growing seasons.
    Changes in EC areas reflect the extent to which producers
will grow so-called "C" sugar for unsubsidised sale to the world
market. This is what is produced in excess of the basic area
needed to meet the EC "A" and "B" quotas, which receive full and
partial price support, respectively.
    Some analysts said the open row that broke out last week
between producers and the EC commission over its export policy
could have serious implications for future sugar output.
    Beet producers have threatened to effectively dump nearly
one mln tonnes of white sugar into EC intervention stocks as
they feel export subsidies have been too low to compensate for
the gap between high EC internal and low world market prices.
    However, with the EC budget stretched to breaking point,
this could give treasury ministers extra resolve in resisting
higher guaranteed sugar prices and build a case for a future
cut in the basic "A" and "B" quotas, they added.
    In France, the largest producer of EC quota and non quota
sugar, the sugar market intervention board FIRS said first
planting intentions indicate an area about the same as last
year's 421,000 hectares, nine pct below the previous year.
    "The basic trend is towards stability," a FIRS spokesman
said. Unlike world market raw sugar prices in dollars, white
sugar French franc prices are not particularly high and are not
encouraging higher planting levels, he said. Beet sugar output
last year was 3.37 mln tonnes, with an average yield of 8.00
tonnes per ha, the highest in the EC apart from the Netherlands
but below 8.52 the previous year and a five year average 8.11.
    In West Germany, recent price rises have not altered plans,
since planting decisions were taken a few months ago, industry
sources said. The farm ministry said a December survey is still
valid and plantings should be cut slightly after being trimmed
by just under four pct in 1986 when yields were above average.
    Licht last week estimated West German plantings at a
reduced 385,000 hectares against 399,000 last year.
    British Sugar Plc, the monopoly beet processor, has signed
up U.K. Farmers to grow 8.1 mln tonnes of beet. This should
yield about 1.25 mln tonnes of whites. Last year's crop
equalled the second highest ever at 1.32 mln tonnes.
    British Sugar has "A" and "B" quotas totalling 1.144 mln tonnes
of whites and its "C" output is due to improved yields from more
consistent disease-resistant seed types.
    Recent price rises have not altered Polish plans, Wincenty
Nowicki, a deputy director of Cukropol, the Amalgamated Sugar
Industry Enterprises, said. World prices are still below Polish
production costs and there is no way to convince farmers to
increase the area above the already signed contracted level.
    The national plan, set before prices began to rise, put
plantings this year at 460,000 hectares, against 425,000 in
1986, Nowicki said. Last year production was 1.74 mln tonnes.
    World prices have less impact in Italy than in France or
Germany as it is traditionally not an exporter but is geared to
the domestic market, an official at the national beet growers'
association said. Italian sowings are not yet complete but
surveys suggest a drop from last year's 270,000 ha, especially
in the north where some farmers have switched to soya.
    Beet output last season of 15.5 mln tonnes yielded a higher
than expected 1.72 mln tonnes of white sugar.
    Dutch plantings are expected to fall to 130,000 ha from a
record 137,600 in 1986 as a new self-imposed quota system comes
into force, a spokesman for Centrale Suiker, the second largest
Dutch sugar processor, said.
    The new system aims for an average of around 915,000 tonnes
of white sugar and to cut output of "C" sugar. Last year, the
Netherlands produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes of white sugar
against a combined "A" and "B" quota of only 872,000 tonnes.
    "The world price of sugar would have to rise much higher
than it has done recently to make planned production of "C" sugar
really worthwhile," the spokesman said.
    Western agricultural experts in Moscow said Soviet planting
intentions are likely to be unchanged. Licht put this year's
Soviet beet area at 3.40 mln ha, against 3.44 mln last year.
    Hungary is expanding its beet area to 105,000 ha from some
95,000 in 1986, the official MTI news agency said, but
diplomats said policy is to balance supply with domestic
demand.
    The Spanish ministry of agriculture said beet sowings are
estimated unchanged at 180,000 ha this year.
    A spokesman for Denmark's largest beet concern, De Danske
Sukkerfabrikker A/S, said its 1987 sugar target was unchanged
from 1986 at 365,000 tonnes from a steady area of 60,000 ha.
    In Sweden, where beet is grown just to meet domestic
demand, the planted area is seen little changed at 51,000 ha
against 51,300 last year, according to a spokesman for sugar
company Svenska Sockerfabriks AB.
    Last year, Irish yields were the lowest for 10 years due to
late sowings and the state-run Irish Sugar Plc said the 1987
plantings target is the equivalent of 36,400 hectares, down
from 37,600 in 1986.

the government to reach 2.126 mln tonnes in calendar 1987
against projected consumption of 2.039 mln tonnes, Agriculture
Minister Achmad Affandi said.
    Production in 1986, when Indonesia was forced to import
sugar, is officially estimated at 2.016 mln tonnes against
1.728 mln in 1985.
    The U.S. Embassy said in its annual Agriculture Report on
Indonesia there were growing signs that actual output was lower
than official figures. It estimated 1986 production at 1.8 mln
tonnes and forecast little change for 1987.
    Indonesia imported 162,000 tonnes of sugar towards the end
of last year and in early 1987 to boost low stocks.
    Affandi told reporters stocks fe l to as low as 159,000
tonnes at the beginning of 1987. Industry sources said this
represented under one month's consumption.
    The minister said Indonesia should hold three months'
supply, or 510,000 tonnes.
    A spokesman for the National Logistics Bureau, which
distributes and stores sugar, said stocks this month were
489,437 tonnes. The harvesting season begins in April.

 ]]></BODY><BODY><![CDATA[Latin American sugar producers
are awaiting further rises in world market prices before moving
to boost production, official and trade sources said.
    Although prices have risen to around eight from five U.S.
Cents per lb in the past six months, they are still below the
region's nine to ten cents per lb average production cost.
    The recent rise in prices has placed producers on the
alert, Manuel Rico, a consultant with the Group of Latin
American and Caribbean Sugar Exporting Countries (GEPLACEA),
told Reuters.
    However, Rico said, it would require another five to seven
cents to stimulate notable increases in output.
    "Producers are taking measures for increasing their
production when the prices are profitable," he said.
    Officials in Mexico, Guatemala and Ecuador said a continued
rise in prices would stimulate production, but industry leaders
in Panama and Costa Rica said there was still a long way to go.
    "The prices are ridiculous," said Julian Mateo, vice
president of Costa Rica's Sugar Cane Industrial-Agricultural
League. "At current prices nobody is going to consider
increasing production."
    Other producers are wary of committing funds to increasing
output, given the instability of world markets.
    An official at Colombia's National Association of Sugar
Cane Growers said they had no plans to raise export targets.
"The market is very unstable. What is happening is not yet
giving way to a pattern and so there is no reason to modify
anything."
    In 1985, the latest year for which full figures are
available, Central and South American nations produced 28 mln
tonnes, raw value, of sugar of which 12.3 mln were exported. A
year earlier, they had produced and exported about 800,000
more, according to the London-based International Sugar
Organization.
    Years of continuous low prices have plunged the sugar
industry in many countries in the region into a recession from
which it will be hard to recover.
    Miguel Guerrero, director of the Dominican Republic's
National Sugar Institute, said it would be difficult to boost
production even if prices recovered sharply.
    Output had slumped to under 450,000 tonnes a year from
900,000 in the late 1970s. Obsolete refineries, poor transport
and badly maintained plantations were barriers to any short
term recovery in output, he added.
    Plans of nearby Cuba, the world's largest cane sugar
exporter, to increase output to 10 mln tonnes a year by the end
of the decade seem ambitious, trade sources said. Output is
running well below the record 8.6 mln produced in 1970.
    Cuba suffers from run down plantations, harvesting problems
and poor processing facilities more than from low world prices,
since much of its output is sold to Eastern Bloc countries
under special deals. Last year, bad weather added to its
troubles, and output fell to 7.2 mln tonnes from 8.2 mln in
1985.
    The low world prices of recent years have led many
countries in the region to cut exportable production to levels
where they barely cover U.S. And, in the case of some Caribbean
countries, European Community (EC) import quotas, for which
they receive prices well above free market levels.
    Progressive reductions in the U.S. Quotas have led to
production stagnating or falling rather than being shifted to
the free world market.
    Peru, for example, shipped 96,000 tonnes to the U.S. In
both 1983 and 1984. This fell to 76,000 in 1986 and this year
its quota is only 37,000.
    A national cooperative official said that, as long as world
market levels continue at around half of Peru's production
cost, the future of the industry is uncertain.
    At a meeting of GEPLACEA in Brazil last October officials
stressed the need to find alternative uses for sugar cane
which, according to the group's executive-secretary Eduardo
Latorre, "grows like a weed" throughout the region.
    Brazil, the largest cane producer with output of around 240
mln tonnes, uses over half to produce alcohol fuel. Cane in
excess of internal demand for alcohol and sugar is refined into
sugar for sale abroad to earn much needed foreign currency.
    The difference in the price the state-run Sugar and Alcohol
Institute (IAA) pays local industry and what it receives from
foreign buyers costs the government some 350 mln dlrs a year.
    Soaring domestic demand for both alcohol and sugar over the
past year, coupled with a drought-reduced cane crop, has meant
Brazil will have difficulties in meeting export commitments in
1987, trade sources said. Negotiations to delay shipments to
next year have been indecisive so far, the main sticking point
being how Brazil should compensate buyers for non-delivery of
sugar it had sold at around five cents per lb and which would
cost eight cents to replace.
    Brazilian sugar industry sources said new sugar export
sales were expected to be extremely low for the next year, with
the Institute wary of exposing itself to domestic shortages of
either alcohol or sugar and because of the need to rebuild
depleted reserve stockpiles.
    However, the situation could change dramatically if the
economy goes into recession and internal demand slumps.
    Sources within Latin America and the Caribbean hold little
hope for the region's sugar industry to return to profitability
unless the U.S. And EC change their policies.
    "The agricultural policies of the European Community and of
the United States have caused our economies incalculable harm
by closing their markets, by price deterioration in
international commerce and furthermore by the unfair
competition in third countries," Brazil's Trade and Industry
Minister Jose Hugo Castelo Branco told the October GEPLACEA
meeting.
    The EC has come under prolonged attack from GEPLACEA for
what the group charges is its continued dumping of excess
output on world markets. GEPLACEA officials say this is the
main cause of low prices.
    GEPLACEA sees a new International Sugar Agreement which
would regulate prices as one of the few chances of pulling the
region's industry out of steady decline. Such an agreement
would have to have both U.S. And EC backing and industrialised
countries would have to see it as a political rather than a
merely economic pact.
    "They have to realise that the more our economies suffer,
the less capcity we have to buy their goods and repay the
region's 360 billion dollar foreign debt," GEPLACEA's Latorre
said.

 ]]></BODY><BODY><![CDATA[The rebate granted at yesterday's EC
sugar tender represents some concession to producers'
complaints that they are losing money on exports outside the
bloc, EC Commission officials said.
    The maximum rebate of 44.819 European currency units (Ecus)
per 100 kilos was 1.3 Ecus below what producers say is needed
to obtain the equivalent price to that offered for sales into
intervention.
    The rebate at last week's tender was 2.5 Ecus per 100 kilos
short of the level producers said was needed, the officials
said.
    The officials said the Commission is not negotiating with
producers who have offered a total of 854,000 tonnes of sugar
for sale into intervention in an apparent attempt to persuade
it to offer higher rebates.
    They said the French and German producers involved are now
unable to withdraw this offer before April 1 when the sugar
will officially enter intervention stores.
    Payment for it is due five weeks later, and it will be open
to them to withdraw their offers at any time between April 1
and the official payment date when the Commission officially
takes ownership of the sugar, the officials said.
    The officials said if the Commission has to buy the sugar,
it is determined to immediately resell it, a move which would
drive down market prices further.
    They expressed some hope that the operators would not
eventually go through with their plan for intervention sales.
    "We think they realise they have gone too far," one official
said.

into intervention may be offered by the European Commission for

    The Commission will propose to offer the sugar at a very
nominal premium of 0.01 European Currency Unit (Ecu) to the
intervention price, with detrimental consequences for
producers' returns, Czarnikow says. The move is seen as an
attempt to persuade the producers to take back the surrendered
sugar.
    The Commission may also take other steps to dissuade
producers from their chosen course, such as removing the time
limit on storage contracts, which presently means that
intervention stocks have to be removed by the end of September,
Czarnikow says. There is also the possibility of production
quotas being reduced.
    If the Commission decided to offer the sugar to traders for
export, the restitutions would have to be higher than those at
recent export tenders, Czarnikow notes. To match the difference
between the EC price and the world market price, the extra
costs might be as much as 20 Ecus per tonne, it says.
    The producers might have to repay these costs through
production levies and the proposed special elimination levy,
Czarnikow says, but it would be several months before any costs
could be recovered under EC rules.
    The primary cause of the plan to sell 775,000 tonnes of
sugar into intervention in France is dissatisfaction with the
EC export program as the restitution has increasingly failed to
bridge the gap between the EC price and the world market price,
Czarnikow notes. The French move is thus seen as a form of
protest designed to force the Commission's hand.
    In West Germany, 79,250 tonnes have been tendered for
intervention, but Czarnikow says the motive here is to ensure
that the 1986/87 price is paid for sugar that was produced in
1986. In addition to a two pct cut in the intervention price,
West German producers face a further price reduction in July
with a probable revaluation of the "green" mark.
    Even if the immediate crisis is resolved, the problem is
not expected to disappear permanently. It has appeared to
traders for some years that the EC's export policy is
insufficiently responsive to changing patterns of demand, it
says.
    The weekly tenders should respond to fluctuating demand by
increasing or reducing the tonnage awarded, Czarnikow says,
suggesting that the Commission might also take steps to cut
down the amount of "unnecessary bureaucracy" surrounding the
export tender system.

said.
    Previous ISO chief William Miller retired at end-February
last year.
    Ricart told Reuters his first aim is put the "house in order"
by having a new administrative sugar pact with improved
allocations of voting rights and financial contributions.
    Once this is done, time can be dedicated to working towards
a new International Sugar Agreement (ISA) with economic
clauses, he said.
    Ricart, currently the Dominican Republic's ambassador to
Austria, the Netherlands and the UN in Geneva, said he will
visit the four major exporters - Australia, Brazil, Cuba and
the European Community - to talk to governments and producers
and find out about problems that are preventing these countries

 ]]></BODY><BODY><![CDATA[The International Sugar Agreement (ISA)
will be renegotiated, International Sugar Organization (ISO)
officer in charge Constantin Politoff told Reuters after a
special session of the pact's council.
    A decision on how to renegotiate will be taken at the ISO
six monthly session in May. The alternatives are between an
autumn London conference for another pact without economic
clauses, but a different voting and budgetary structure, or a
Geneva-based conference next year for a new pact with economic
clauses, he said.
    But delegates said the latter would only be considered if
the world's four major exporters -- Australia, Brazil, Cuba and
the European Community -- can resolve differences over how
prices can best be supported and how to share the world
    Today's special session was called because the U.S. earlier
indicated it would only be able to pay 56 pct of its share of
the ISO budget.
    At today's council session Politoff said the U.S. would try
and find a way to pay the balance of about 50,000 stg later
this year. Currently, about three quarters of this year's ISO
800,000 stg budget has not been paid but delegates said the
U.S. caused controversy as it said it might not pay its full
contribution in the last year of the current pact.
    The Soviet Union has called for changes to the way the ISO
budget is shared out. Currently it is halved between importers
and exporters and the Soviet Union has a 30 pct share of the
importer half. The Soviets want a new sugar pact to have only a
single category of members who would all share the costs pro
rata to their share of world sugar trade.
    The ISO executive committee next meets on April 23 with the
next full council session in the week of May 19.
    There are 12 importing and 44 exporting members of the ISO.

dispute between European sugar producers and the European
Community over EC export licencing policies, Jean-Marc Vernes,
president of French sugar producer Beghin-Say, which is leading
the protest, told journalists today.
    "Our contacts with the EC authorities over the past few days
indicate that we are moving towards a solution," he said, adding
that if this happened the producers would withdraw the 854,000
tonnes of sugar they have offered into intervention.
    Vernes said that the protest, involving 770,000 tonnes of
sugar from French producers alone, was prompted by the EC's
policy since mid-1986 of offering export rebates which failed
to give producers an equivalent price to that they would obtain
by offering sugar into EC intervention.
    At last week's tender the EC Commission made an apparent
concession by offering a maximum rebate only 1.3 European
currency units (Ecus) per 100 kilos below the level producers
say is needed, compared with the previous week's rebate which
was 2.5 Ecus below the necessary level.
    Vernes would not say what form any compromise between the
producers and the EC would take, but he reaffirmed the
long-term desire of producers to export to the world market,
providing they were not losing money by doing so.
    Producers can withdraw their intervention offer after April
1, when the sugar will officially enter intervention stores, or
at any time over the following five weeks before the official
payment date.
    The EC has threatened to put the sugar back on the internal
market if the producers refuse to withdraw their offers.

1987 sugar import quota of one mln short tons by bringing
forward to the third quarter some shipments scheduled for the
fourth quarter of 1987, Jerry Huckaby, a leading Congressman
representing sugar growers told Reuters in an interview.
    Huckaby, a Louisiana Democrat and chairman of the House
subcommittee which deals with the sugar program, indicated the
easing of the quota might be a way to calm the concern about
the impact of the severe cut in U.S. sugar imports this year.
    "With imports coming down from 1.8 mln (last year) to one
mln, there is legitimate concern about the impacts on Caribbean
countries and the Philippines," Huckaby said.
    By bringing forward to the third quarter some imports, the
quota would effectively be eased by about 250,000 tons.
    Huckaby said by simply bringing forward to the third
quarter of the year sugar imports scheduled for the September
to December period "we could get away without having to
increase the quota."
    He noted that some in the sugar industry believe an
increase in the quota is justified.
    Earlier this month, representatives of U.S. cane sugar
refiners met with U.S. Agriculture Department officials to
request a quota increase of at least 200,000 tons. The refiners
said the increase is needed because the quota is so restrictive
there could be some spot shortages of sugar in the U.S later
this year, a refiner spokesman said.
    However, the official slaid the USDA replied only that it
would consider the request.
    Following the refiners' request, representatives of the
Florida sugarcane producers met with USDA to express opposition
to any quota expansion, industry sources said.
    The statement by Huckaby, who as a representative from a
sugar growing district in Louisiana is a leading architect of
the current sugar program, indicates at least some grower
officials are concerned enough to support an easing of the
import quota, industry officials said.
    Any final decision on easing the quota must be made by the
Reagan administration's interagency sugar policy group.
    Asked about possible quota changes, A USDA official said
"As far as I know, changing the quota volume or the quota year
is not under active consideration."

import sugar from April 1, senior officials of the Food and
Cooperatives Ministry and the Department told Reuters.
    They said the decision was taken after the Sugar Importers
Association asked that the sugar trade be further liberalised.
    "The Food Department will cease trading in sugar and will no
longer hold a buffer stock," a senior official said.
    He said the government has finalised an agreement with
E.D.F.Man (Sugar) Ltd under which E.D.F.Man will hold a buffer
stock on the government's behalf of 20,000 tonnes, against the
45,000 tonne buffer stock usually held by the Department.
    Officials said the size of the buffer stock has been
reduced because the private sector will hold its own stocks.
    The agreement with E.D.F. Man includes details such as
trigger pricing mechanisms, they said.
    Four months ago the Department allowed the private sector
to import sugar without government clearance. The Department
and the private sector each imported around 115,000 tonnes of
sugar last year, when national consumption was 280,000 tonnes.
    An Importers Association official said that "even if the
Department no longer imports sugar, we would not necessarily
buy more."
    This is because the Association would still have to compete
with the Cooperatives Wholesale Establishment (CWE), he said.
    The CWE is a semi-government body and the official said
arrangements are being made for state cooperatives and holders
of food subsidy stamps to draw their sugar from it, starting
April 1.
    Ministry officials said the CWE can either import sugar or
buy it from a local bonded warehousing scheme run by E.D.F. For

1987/88 crop year ending August has been set at 1.6 mln tonnes,
up from a provisional 1.3 mln tonnes this year, Sugar
Regulatory Administration (SRA) chairman Arsenio Yulo said.
    Yulo told Reuters a survey during the current milling
season, which ends next month, showed the 1986/87 estimate
would almost certainly be met.
    He said at least 1.2 mln tonnes of the 1987/88 crop would
be earmarked for domestic consumption.
    Yulo said about 130,000 tonnes would be set aside for the
U.S. Sugar quota, 150,000 tonnes for strategic reserves and
50,000 tonnes would be sold on the world market.
    He said if the government approved a long-standing SRA
recommendation to manufacture ethanol, the project would take
up another 150,000 tonnes, slightly raising the target.
    "The government, for its own reasons, has been delaying
approval of the project, but we expect it to come through by
July," Yulo said.
    Ethanol could make up five pct of gasoline, cutting the oil
import bill by about 300 mln pesos.
    Yulo said three major Philippine distilleries were ready to
start manufacturing ethanol if the project was approved.
    The ethanol project would result in employment for about
100,000 people, sharply reducing those thrown out of work by
depressed world sugar prices and a moribund domestic industry.
    Production quotas, set for the first time in 1987/88, had
been submitted to President Corazon Aquino.
    "I think the President would rather wait till the new
Congress convenes after the May elections," he said. "But there
is really no need for such quotas. We are right now producing
just slightly over our own consumption level."
    "The producers have never enjoyed such high prices," Yulo
said, adding sugar was currently selling locally for 320 pesos
per picul, up from 190 pesos last August.
    Yulo said prices were driven up because of speculation
following the SRA's bid to control production.
    "We are no longer concerned so much with the world market,"
he said, adding producers in the Negros region had learned from
their mistakes and diversified into corn and prawn farming and
cloth production.
    He said diversification into products other than ethanol
was also possible within the sugar industry.
    "The Brazilians long ago learnt their lessons," Yulo said.
"They have 300 sugar mills, compared with our 41, but they
relocated many of them and diversified production. We want to
call this a 'sugarcane industry' instead of the sugar industry."
    He said sugarcane could be fed to pigs and livestock, used
for thatching roofs, or used in room panelling.
    "When you cut sugarcane you don't even have to produce
sugar," he said.
    Yulo said the Philippines was lobbying for a renewal of the
International Sugar Agreement, which expired in 1984.
    "As a major sugar producer we are urging them to write a new
agreement which would revive world prices," Yulo said.
    "If there is no agreement world prices will always be
depressed, particularly because the European Community is
subsidising its producers and dumping sugar on the markets."
    He said current world prices, holding steady at about 7.60
cents per pound, were uneconomical for the Philippines, where
production costs ranged from 12 to 14 cents a pound.
    "If the price holds steady for a while at 7.60 cents I
expect the level to rise to about 11 cents a pound by the end
of this year," he said.
    Yulo said economists forecast a bullish sugar market by
1990, with world consumption outstripping production.
    He said sugar markets were holding up despite encroachments
from artificial sweeteners and high-fructose corn syrup.
    "But we are not happy with the Reagan Administration," he
said. "Since 1935 we have been regular suppliers of sugar to the
U.S. In 1982, when they restored the quota system, they cut
ours in half without any justification."
    Manila was keenly watching Washington's moves to cut
domestic support prices to 12 cents a pound from 18 cents.
    The U.S. Agriculture Department last December slashed its
12 month 1987 sugar import quota from the Philippines to
143,780 short tons from 231,660 short tons in 1986.
    Yulo said despite next year's increased production target,
some Philippine mills were expected to shut down.
    "At least four of the 41 mills were not working during the
1986/87 season," he said. "We expect two or three more to follow
suit during the next season."

extended its recent buying programme by taking five to eight
raws cargoes from the free market at around 30/40 points under
New York May futures highlight recent worldwide demand for
sugar for a variety of destinations, traders said.
    The Soviet buying follows recent whites buying by India,
Turkey and Libya, as well as possible raws offtake by China.
    Some 300,000 to 400,000 tonnes could have changed hands in
current activity, which is encouraging for a sugar trade which
previously saw little worthwhile end-buyer enquiry, they added.
    Dealers said a large proportion of the sales to the Soviet
Union in the past few days involved Japanese operators selling
Thai origin sugar.
    Prices for nearby shipment Thai sugars have tightened
considerably recently due to good Far Eastern demand, possibly
for sales to the Soviet Union or to pre-empt any large block
enquiries by China, they said.
    Thai prices for March/May 15 shipments have hardened to
around 13/14 points under May New York from larger discounts
previously, they added.
    Traders said the Soviet Union might be looking to buy more
sugar in the near term, possibly towards an overall requirement
this year of around two mln tonnes. It is probable that some
1.8 mln tonnes have already been taken up, they said.
    Turkey was reported this week to have bought around 100,000
tonnes of whites while India had further whites purchases of

belt along the Queensland coast have been receiving just enough
rain to sustain the 1987 crop, an Australian Sugar Producers
Association spokesman said.
    The industry is not as worried as it was two weeks ago, but
rainfall is still below normal and good soaking rains are
needed in some areas, notably in the Burdekin and Mackay
regions, he said from Brisbane.
    Elsewhere, in the far north and the far south of the state
and in northern New South Wales, the cane crop is looking very
good after heavy falls this month, he said.
    The spokesman said it is still too early to tell what
effect the dry weather will have on the size of the crop, which
is harvested from around June to December.
    He said frequent but light falls in the areas that are
short of moisture, such as Mackay, mean they really only need
about three days of the region's heavy tropical rains to
restore normal moisture to the cane.
    But rainfall in the next two or three weeks will be crucial
to the size of the crop in the dry areas, he said.
    "It's certainly not a disastrous crop at this stage but it
might be in a month without some good falls," he said.

organizations said they expect some increase the area planted
to sugarbeets this year and said the prospects for the 1987
cane sugar crop also are good.
    Dave Carter, president of the U.S. beet sugar association,
said plantings may be up in two major beet growing states,
California and Michigan, while sowings could be down slightly
in the largest producing state of Minnesota.
    Overall, Carter predicted beet plantings would rise in the
midwest, and this coupled with increases in California would
increase U.S. sugarbeet plantings slightly from the 1.232 mln
acres sown last year.
    USDA later today releases its first estimate of 1987 U.S.
sugarbeet plantings in the prospective plantings report.
    The main reason for the expected increase in beet sowings
is that returns from competing crops such as soybeans and
grains are "just awful," said Carter.
    In the midwest, bankers are strongly encouraging farmers to
plant sugarbeets because the U.S. sugar program offers a loan
rate of 18 cents per pound and because payments to farmers from
beet processors are spread evenly over the growing season, said
Luther Markwart, executive vice president of the American
sugarbeet growers association.
    "The banks are putting a lot of pressure on these guys,"
Markwart said.
    In some areas there are waiting lists of farmers seeking a
contract with processors to plant beets, Markwart said.
    USDA's report today will not include any harvested area
estimates for sugarcane, but representatives of Florida, Hawaii
and Louisiana growers said crop prospects are good.
    Horis Godfrey, a consultant representing Florida and Texas
cane growers, said Florida cane is off to a good start  because
for the first time in several years there was no winter freeze.
Although area to be harvesteed is about the same as last year,
cane production may be up in Florida this year, he said.
    In Hawaii, area harvested may decline slightly this year,
but likely will be offset again in 1987 by increased yields,
said Eiler Ravnholt, vice president of the Hawaiian Sugar
Planters Association.
    The acreage planted to sugarbeets will receive more than
the usual amount of attention this year because of mounting
concern that continued increases in domestic sugar production
threaten the U.S. sugar program, industry sources said.
    The increases in beet plantings have especially caused
concern among cane growers who have not expanded plantings,
particularly in Hawaii, industry officials said.
    "We haven't had a good weather year throughout the beet and
cane areas in more than five years," said Godfrey, adding that
the U.S. may be due for a good weather year.
    Rep. Jerry Huckaby, D-La., chairman of the House
agriculture subcommittee responsible for the sugar program, has
threatened to offer legislation next year to curb domestic
sweetener output if growers fail to restrain output in 1987.

854,000 tonnes of sugar to European Community intervention
stocks still stands, Andrea Minguzzi, an official at French
sugar producer Beghin-Say, said.
    Last week Beghin-Say president Jean-Marc Vernes said a
possible settlement of a row with the EC would lead producers
to withdraw their offer, which was made as a protest against EC
export licensing policies.
    The EC policy is to offer export rebates, which fail to
give producers an equivalent price to that which they would get
by offering sugar into intervention stocks, Vernes said.
    But Minguzzi said the offer was a commercial affair and
that producers had no intention of withdrawing the sugar offer
already lodged with intervention boards of different European
countries. He said final quality approval for all the sugar
offered could come later this week. Some 95 pct had already
cleared quality specifications.
    The EC can only reject an offer to sell into intervention
stocks on quality grounds. Minguzzi added that under EC
regulations, the Community has until early May to pay for the
sugar. He declined to put an exact figure on the amount of
sugar offered by Beghin-Say, but said it was below 500,000

yesterday's European Community (EC) sugar tender marked no
change in policy towards producers' complaints that they are
losing money on exports outside the EC, EC commission sources
said.
    They said this was despite the fact that the commission
accepted over 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention
yesterday from traders protesting that rebates are being set
too low.
    The maximum rebate at yesterday's tender was 46.864 Ecus
per 100 kilos, up from 45.678 Ecus the previous week.
    London traders said yesterday the rebate was the largest
ever granted. The commission sources said today the increase
was entirely explained by world market conditions. The amount
by which the rebate fell short of what producers claim is
needed to obtain an equivalent price to that for sales into
intervention remained at 0.87 Ecus per 100 kilos, they said.
    Operators offered a total of 854,000 tonnes of sugar into
intervention last month to protest at rebates which they said
were too low. The sources said about 706,470 tonnes of French
sugar and 79,000 tonnes of German sugar had been accepted, the
remainder being rejected as of too low quality.
    The sources noted the operators could withdraw their offers
in the five week period between the acceptance of the sugar and
payment for it.
    They said they saw no sign of planned withdrawals as yet,
adding that they would expect operators to wait another week or
two to review commission policy before making up their minds.
    The sources said the commission felt entitled to offer

Agriculture Committee yesterday requiring quotas on U.S.
imports of products containing sugar is unlikely to remain in a

    The amendment, offered by Rep. Arlan Stangeland, R-Minn.,
would require quotas on the import of any merchandise
containing over 25 pct sugar or other farm products which are
now subject to U.S. quotas.
    Supporters of the amendment said it is aimed at curbing
shipments of food products containing sugar from Canada.
However, the Ways and Means committee, which has overall
jurisdiction on trade legislation, will try to kill the
amendment as protectionist, a committee aide said.
    An Agriculture committee aide acknowledged the proposal
probably will not survive scrutiny by other House committees.
But he said the amendment was introduced in part to send a
warning to U.S. companies considering moving food processing
plants to Canada to avoid the restrictive U.S. sugar quota.
    In debate on the amendment yesterday, Rep. Stangeland and
other supporters said the proposal would have no effect on the
status of foreign trade zones.
    Sugar producer groups pushed for the amendment on
sugar-containing products because they believe sugar is being

due to increased producer pricing sales and evidence of export
availability, has encouraged renewed buying interest from China
and the Soviet Union, London trade house E.D.And F. Man said.
    Further purchases are expected by the Peoples Republic of
China at the lower end of the recent price range, which should
limit the downside movement, it said in its latest monthly
market report.
   "And it is believed that the Soviet Union will need to return
to the market to take a further 250,000/350,000 tonnes for
May/June shipment, Man added.
    The Soviets purchased five cargoes of raws for April/May
shipment towards the end of last month, which brings its total
purchases to around 1.65 mln tonnes, Man said.
    Production estimates for the Thai crop now exceed 2.3 mln
tonnes and the final outturn appears set to reach around 2.5
mln tonnes. However, this upturn in the Thai crop is being
countered by a reduction in China's production forecast to 5.3
mln tonnes from 5.5 mln estimated earlier.
    Market participation by Cuba suggests that its crop could
be close to last year's 7.3 mln tonnes. But even with similar
production Man expects Cuban exports to be significantly down.
    Cuba was reported to be carrying 1.3 mln tonnes of stocks
in September 1985, of which some 440,000 tonnes were used to
boost its 1985/86 exports to about 6.9 mln. But as it will not
be able to draw on surplus stocks this year, Man estimates
Cuba's export availabilty will be reduced to 6.4 to 6.5 mln
tonnes.
    However, Cuba is only one of a large number of exporters
with reduced availability, Man said.
    Since 1980 the total free market export supply has fallen
to 18 mln from about 22 mln tonnes. But at the same time free
market demand has also fallen by almost the same amount, which
has left exporters chasing falling import requirements.
    A fairly tight balance now appears to have emerged. But the
difficult task of keeping production advances at bay still
remains, as at least one more season of production deficit is
needed to eliminate some of the remaining surplus stocks still
overhanging the market, Man said.
    The increasing cases of record production as a result of
record yields and better husbandry have forced sugar producers
to strive for greater efficiency.
    As this increase in efficiency reduces the marginal cost of
production, sugar exporters may become more responsive to
prices and in particular to upward price movements, Man said.
    Commenting on the current row between the EC Commission and
sugar producers, Man said despite the recent improvement in the
level of restitutions, they are still insufficient to fully
compensate producers when exporting on the world market.
    Unless there are further improvements, at least some sugar
is expected to remain in intervention, it added.

currently planning to withdraw the sugar it has placed into
intervention, despite the exceptionally high rebate awarded at
this week's European Community (EC) sugar tender, Beghin-Say
President Jean-Marc Vernes told Reuters.
    The maximum rebate of 46.864 Ecus per 100 kilos on
Wednesday was the largest ever granted, according to traders.
    Vernes said he was satisfied the European Commission has
started to move in the right direction, but said his company
had no plans to change its decision to put sugar into
intervention.
    But Vernes said he hoped that in the next few weeks a final
agreement would be reached with the commission which would
allow operators to withdraw the sugar from intervention.
    European operators offered 854,000 tonnes of sugar into
intervention to protest about export rebates which they say are
too low. Over 785,000 tonnes of this sugar was accepted by the
commission on Wednesday, according to commission sources.
    Under EC regulations, however, operators have another four
to five weeks to withdraw the sugar from intervention before
payment is made for it.
    A total of 706,470 tonnes of French sugar and 79,000 tonnes
of West German sugar has been accepted into intervention, trade
sources said here. This amount represents about a third of
annual EC exports to non-EC countries.
    Beghin-Say declined to specify the amount of sugar it had
offered into intervention, but said it was below 500,000
tonnes.
    Producers say they have been losing 2.5 to 3.0 Ecus on
every 100 kilos exported due to the failure of rebates to fully
bridge the gap between EC and world prices. Wednesday's rebate
was 0.87 Ecus short of what producers say is needed to get an
equivalent price to that for sales into intervention, traders
said.
    Vernes said operators hope to get a rebate which equates to
the full intervention price and said Wednesday's tender was a
step in the right direction.
    Sugar producers here said the volume of sugar authorised
for export since the begining of the current campaign had been
inadequate and that more should be exported now to compensate.
    Trade sources said new regulations governing export
rebates, which are due to be adopted shortly, may smooth the
path for the commission to award larger export rebates in
future.
    One source at a leading French sugar house said it seemed
the commission had understood the protest action and was now
moving towards adapting the situation accordingly, thereby
allowing the operators to withdraw their sugar from
intervention once they got satisfaction.

130,000 hectare Dutch sugar beet crop is already in the ground,
a spokesman for Suiker Unie, the largest sugar processor in the
Netherlands, told Reuters.
    Conditions are generally good and the average sowing date
for the crop is expected to be around April 11, against April
23 last year, and a 10-year average of April 14, the spokesman
added.
    "It is far too early yet to say what kind of output we can
expect when it comes to harvest in September, but at least the
crop is off to a very good start," he said.
    Last year, the Netherlands planted a record 137,600
hectares of sugar beet and produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes of
white sugar, substantially more than the country's combined "A"
and "B" quota of 872,000 tonnes.
    This year, however, a self-imposed quota system has been
introduced with the aim of cutting plantings to 130,000
hectares and reducing white sugar output to around 915,000
tonnes to minimise the amount of non-quota "C" sugar produced.
    Only farmers with a record of growing suger beet have been
allotted quotas. This is expected to prevent the area being
boosted by dairy or cereal farmers moving into sugar.

    The maximum rebate was 46.496 Ecus per 100 kilos for
118,350 tonnes of sugar, down from 46.864 Ecus the previous

obtain a price equivalent to the intervention price by over one
Ecu per 100 kilos, and was 0.87 Ecu short the previous week,
the sources said.
    They said this was despite the fact that the Commission had

nation's second largest employer closed its doors yesterday,
saying it had been run out of business by sugar smuggled from
Miami and the neighbouring Dominican Republic.
    The closure of the Haitian American Sugar Company (HASCO)
will idle 3,500 employees and affect as many as 30,000 to
40,000 small sugar cane planters in regions around the capital,
the company said.
    "Because of unprecedented and ever-growing smuggling, HASCO
regrets ... It cannot continue to accept delivery of sugar cane
after April 10," the mill warned planters earlier this week.
    Since President Jean-Claude Duvalier fled Haiti fourteen
months ago, widescale smuggling of basic goods such as cooking
oil, flour, rice, sugar and canned milk has lowered consumer
prices but bankrupted several local manufacturers, throwing
hundreds of thousands of Haitians out of work.
    At the HASCO compound, where grim-faced workers lined up to
receive their last pay, Spokesman Georges D. Rigaud showed a
warehouse stocked with an estimated 445,000 unsold 100-pound
(45-kg) bags of sugar.
    "We are closing because of our huge stock of unsold sugar.
We have no money left to continue operations," Rigaud said.
    He said the company owed 7.6 mln dlrs and had borrowed an
additional 1.5 mln dlrs in order to pay off workers.
    Rigaud blamed the mill's problems on an order by Duvalier
two years ago forbidding HASCO from refining sugar.
    He said the government then began importing refined sugar
at world market prices and reselling it at a huge profit and
the provisional military-civilian government that replaced
Duvalier last year continued the policy.
    "But now with all the smuggling even the state can't compete
with smuggled Dominican refined sugar," Rigaud said.
    HASCO workers earned 4.20 dlrs daily, considerably above
the usual minimum wage of three dlrs.
    It is generally estimated that every employed Haitian
supports at least six people. Rigaud said HASCO's closing at a
minimum would affect 280,000 to 300,000 people.
    Laid-off workers were bitter about the closure. "We're dead,
and it's the government that's causing us to die," declared
Lucien Felix, 34, who has five dependents.

postponement of between 150,000 and 200,000 tonnes of Cuban raw

    Cuba had sought delays for some 300,000 tonnes of
deliveries, they said. It made a similar request in January
when Japanese buyers agreed to postpone some 200,000 tonnes of
sugar deliveries for 1987 until 1988.
    Some buyers rejected the Cuban request because they have
already sold the sugar on to refiners, they added.
    Japanese buyers are believed to have contracts to buy some
950,000 tonnes of raw sugar from Cuba for 1987 shipment.
    But Japan's actual raw sugar imports from Cuba are likely
to total only some 400,000 to 450,000 tonnes this year, against

producers withdrawing white sugar from intervention stores is
that they already have, or are reasonably certain of, obtaining
European Community (EC) export licences for it, traders said.
    They were responding to EC Commission sources in Brussels
saying West German producers have withdrawn most of the 79,250
tonnes of the sugar they put into intervention on April 1.
    The traders said it is also likely that French producers,
who put over 700,000 tonnes into intervention, will withdraw a
significant proportion of this for the same reason before they
are due to accept payment for the sugar in early May.
    Earlier this week traders said the stepping up of the level
of export licences being granted by the EC at recent tenders,
with generous subsidies, had been due to producer threats to
leave the sugar in intervention and to a desire to move most of
the old crop sugar before the new crop tenders start in May.
    The EC has so far granted licences for 2,467,970 tonnes out
of around 3.1 mln tonnes targetted for export in the 1986/87
series of tenders. This would indicate the likelihood of high
tonnages continuing to be moved over the next few tenders and
subsidies also remaining high in order to attract producer bids
for the export licences, traders said.

cane crop in the key Mackay region of Queensland following a
prolonged dry spell relieved only by intermittent falls, an
Australian Sugar Producers Association spokesman told Reuters.
    The rains began late last week, developed into heavy
downpours over the weekend and are continuing today, he said
from Brisbane.
    The Mackay and Burdekin regions, which together grow about
half the Australian cane crop, have been the Queensland cane
areas hardest hit by unseasonal dry weather since December.
    The spokesman said the rain missed the Burdekin area, just
to the north of the Mackay region on the central Queensland
coastal fringe, although recent light showers have freshened
the crop there.
    Owing to the dry spell in the Mackay and Burdekin areas,
the overall 1987 Australian cane crop is likely to be below the
25.4 mln tonnes crushed in 1986 for a 94 net titre raws outturn
of 3.37 mln tonnes, he said.
    But any decline will not be as great as seemed likely a
couple of months ago when it appeared the Mackay-Burdekin crops
were going to suffer badly, he said.
    Preliminary crop estimates are expected to be available
early next month, the spokesman said.
    The crush in the Mackay-Burdekin is likely to start later
this year, in late June or early July against mid-June last
year, to allow the cane to grow and sweeten further, he said.
    The crush normally runs to around the end of December.
    Elsewhere in the sugar belt, the cane is doing well, with
some mill areas expecting record crops, he said.
    Industry records show variations in the crop are not always
mirrored in raws output. In 1985, 24.4 mln tonnes of sweeter
cane than in 1986 produced 3.38 mln tonnes of raws.

    They also said West German producers had now withdrawn the
last 3,000 of the 79,250 tonnes they sold into EC stores on
April 1.
    The sales were made to protest against the level of export
restitutions being granted for sugar at weekly EC tenders.

    Under EC regulations, operators had five weeks before

substantially this year because of foreign exchange constraints
and large stocks, despite falling production and rising
domestic demand, traders and the official press said.
    "Despite rapid increases in domestic production over the
last 30 years, imbalances between supply and demand continue to
be extremely serious," the Farmers Daily said. It said 1986
plantings fell due to removal of crop incentives, because
farmers could earn more from other crops and because technical
and seed improvements had not been widely disseminated.
    The official press had estimated the 1986/87 sugar crop
(November/March) at 4.82 mln tonnes, down from 5.2 mln a year
earlier, and domestic consumption at six mln tonnes a year.
    The Yunnan 1986/87 sugar harvest was a record 521,500
tonnes, the provincial daily said. It gave no year-earlier
figure. Output in Guangxi was 1.04 mln tonnes, the New China
News Agency said without giving a year-earlier figure.
    The Nanfang Daily said production in Guangdong province
fell to estimated 1.92 mln tonnes from 1.96 mln and that the
area under sugar was dropping.
    "Supply of cane (in Guangdong) is inadequate," the newspaper
said. Processing costs are rising and the economic situation of
nearly all the mills is not good. To guarantee supply of cane
is a major problem."
    A Western diplomat said sugar output also fell n Fujian,
south China's fourth major producer, where there was a drop in
area planted.
    He said the rural sectors in Guangdong and Fujian were wel
developed, enabling farmers to choose crops according to the
maximum return, meaning that many had avoided sugar.
    The Farmers Daily said a peasant in the ortheast province
of Heilongjiang could gross 108 yuan from one mu (0.0667
hectares) of soybeans and 112 yuan from one mu of corn but only
70 from one mu of sugarbeet.
    The paper said the profit margin of mills in China fell to
4.7 pct last year from 11.87 pct in 1980.
    Mills lacked the capital to modernise and they competed
with each other for raw materialsX, it added. This resulted in
falling utilisation rates at big, mode{nised mills.
    The price of sugar had not changed in 20 years, the
official press has said.
    Customs figures showed China imported 1.18 mln tonnes of
sugar in calendar 1986, down from 1.9 mln in 1985.
    The diplomat said stocks at end-August 1986 were 2.37 mln
tonnes, up from 1.92 a year earlier.
    A foreign trader here said China accumulated large stocks
in 1982-85 when provincial authorities were allowed to import
sugar on their own authority. This practice was stopped in 1986
when the central government resumed control of imports.
    "As China lacked storage, much of these imports was stored
in Qinghai, Inner Mongolia and other inland areas," the diplomat
said.
    The trader said transporting stocks from these areas to
consumers in east and south China was a problem, particularly
as coal had priority. "How quickly they can move the sugar is
one factor determining import levels," he said.
    Another factor was the quality of the harvest in Cuba,
China's major supplier through barter trade, he said.
    "China bought two distress cargoes last week, for about
152/153 dlrs a tonne," he added. "China is not a desperate buyer
now. But if the Cuban harvest is bad, it will have to go into
the open market."
    A Japanese trader said Peking's major concern regarding
imports was price.
    "While the foreign trade situation has improved this year,
foreign exchange restraints persist," he said.
    The diplomat said domestic demand was rising by about five
pct a year but "a communist government is in a much better
position to regulate demand than a capitalist one, if the
foreign exchange situation demands it."

    In a recent interview with the French communist party

    The harvest was plagued by a four year shortfall of rain

cane cutting by mechanical combines virtually impossible.

    Industry sources said latest forecasts for the 1987 crop
indicated output of 360,000 tonnes, well down on the record
501,800 tonne tel quel production in the 1986 (May-December)
crop year.
    The previous record was set in 1982 when Fiji produced
486,790 tonnes.
    For the past month Fiji sugar farmers have delayed
harvesting the 1987 crop pending a response from the
Governor-general to demands following the May 14 coup.
    Ganilau said in a statement the Fiji Sugar Corp would make
a payment of five dlrs per tonne against the final payment for
the 1986 crop on the understanding that preparations by growers
for commencement of harvesting would be completed at all mills
by June 23.
    Crushing would commence at Labasa and Penang mills on June
23 and at Lautoka and Rarawai mills on June 30, he said.
    The interim payment, to be made on or about June 30, is the
full amount of the grower's share of 1986 sugar proceeds
received to-date. The balance will be paid in October.
    Growers had also called for the full 1987 forecast price of
23.50 dlrs per tonne of cane to be paid in cash on delivery to
the mill, but this has been rejected by the state controlled
Fiji Sugar Corp, Ganilau said.
    However, in addition to the scheduled delivery payment of
14.10 dlrs, an additional sum of 2.35 dlrs, or 10 pct of the
forecast price, would be paid on December 15, on all cane
harvested by November 30, he said.
    Ganilau said, "This will be at least one month in advance of
the expected date of payment of the second payment of cane. The
balance of the second payment will be made six weeks after the
end of crushing."

for the 1983 cane crop rehabilitation programme be written off.
The FDB rejected this request.
    Ganilau said, however, "The bank is prepared to carefully
consider requests for rescheduling loan repayments in cases of
hardship on a case-by-case basis."
    In response to a further demand that all soldiers be
removed from the cane growing areas, Ganilau said the army
would restrict its presence in the cane areas.
    He said he had directed the authorities to issue permits to
harvesting gangs, cane growers and sugar industry trade unions
to hold the necessary meetings in preparation for the
commencement of harvest.
    Senior representatives of the sugar cane growers had
indicated a desire to commence the crush as soon as possible,
he added.

China yesterday via the London trade to supplement the
country's current nearby buying programme, traders said.
    The sugar was reported sold at around 160 dlrs a tonne c
and f for July/August shipment or arrival in September, they
said.
    Some traders said recent Chinese purchases could total as
much as 300,000 tonnes, but others, while agreeing a heavy
volume had been taken, said an amount less than that figure was
involved.
    China was still believed to be in the market for more
sugar, traders said.

western and central parts of Europe continued to slow beet
growth but plant density is reported to be good in most
countries, sugar statistician F.O. Licht said.
    Temperatures were too low for the season and the rain has
hampered field work and occasionally led to water-logged
fields.
    But in eastern and southeastern Europe, warmer weather has
boosted sugar beet growth.
    Weather in the Soviet Union also allowed good beet
development, Licht said.
    In Sweden beet growth has been delayed, although plant
population is reported to be regular and good. Cool and rainy
weather slowed beet growth in Denmark and crop prospects are
rated as slightly below normal.
    In the United Kingdom and Ireland, it was rather cool with
heavy rainfall in places which has delayed beet growth.
    In France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and West Germany, it
was mostly cool with frequent and often heavy rainfall which
continued to slow down beet growth and often made field work
impossible.
    In Austria, it was warm with some rainfall, which was
favourable for beet growth, Licht said.
    In Czechoslovakia and Poland, it was mostly warm, favouring
beet development. but some heavy rain may have caused damage.
    In the European beet growing regions of the Soviet Union,
it was warm with showers over most areas and weather was
generally good for the emergence and growth of beets.
    In south eastern Europe, warm weather with some rainfall
boosted beet development.
    Labour trouble threatens the beet crop in Spain. Disputes
between the factories and the trade unions are threatening to
delay the start of processing in the southern areas, where
beets are maturing very early this year.

in raw sugar with China paying market levels for nearby
shipments, London trader, Woodhouse, Drake and Carey, said in
its weekly report.
    July shipment Thai raws traded to China early in the week
at fob levels equivalent to 20/25 points discount to July New
York futures, it said. Mid-week saw these same sales covered by
the trade at 10/15 points discount.
    Enquiries for July/Sep 15 raw sugars then filtered in and
here again, traded values rose quickly from 13 points premium
to New York July up to 18, Woodhouse said.
    In the Western Hemisphere, both Dominican Republic and
Mexican nearby raws were bid 15 points discount to July New
York and offered five points under, but in limited trading, it
said.
    All the action of the past week has been in the Far East
raws market whereas the whites market saw little fresh prospect
of nearby offtake, Whitehouse added.

Ipswich sugar factory on Sunday afternoon due to an acute
shortage of beet supplies, a spokesman said, responding to a
Reuter inquiry
    Beet supplies have dried up at Ipswich due to a combination
of very wet weather, which has prevented most farmers in the
factory's catchment area from harvesting, and last week's
hurricane which blocked roads.
    The Ipswich factory will remain closed until roads are
cleared and supplies of beet build up again.
    This is the first time in many years that a factory has
been closed in mid-campaign, the spokesman added.
    Other factories are continuing to process beet normally,
but harvesting remains very difficult in most areas.
    Ipswich is one of 13 sugar factories operated by British
Sugar. It processes in excess of 500,000 tonnes of beet a year
out of an annual beet crop of around eight mln tonnes.
    Despite the closure of Ipswich and the severe harvesting
problems in other factory areas, British Sugar is maintaining
its estimate of sugar production this campaign at around 1.2
mln tonnes, white value, against 1.34 mln last year, the
spokesman said.
    British Sugar processes all sugar beet grown in the U.K.
    The sugar beet processing campaign, which began last month,
is expected to run until the end of January. Sugar factories
normally work 24 hours a day, seven days a week during the
campaign.
    As of October 11, 12 pct of the U.K. Sugar crop had been
harvested, little different to the same stage last year when 13
pct had been lifted. Since then, however, very wet weather has
severely restricted beet lifting.
    Harvesting figures for the week to October 18 are not yet
available.

since the start of the Kremlin's anti-alcohol drive indicates
home brewing is costing the state 20 billion roubles in lost
vodka sales, Pravda said.
    The Communist Party newspaper said sugar sales had
increased by one mln tonnes a year, enough to be turned into
two billion bottles of moonshine.
    At current vodka prices of 10 roubles a bottle, it said,
this meant illicit alcohol consumption had reached the
equivalent of 20 billion roubles a year, or annual revenues
from vodka sales before the May 1985 anti-alchohol decree.
    "Official statistics show a reduction in consumption of
vodka, but this is a deceptive statistic -- it does not count
home-brew," Pravda said.
    "The epidemic first engulfed the villages and has now also
firmly settled into cities, where the availability of natural
gas, running water and privacy has made it much easier."
    Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev launched the anti-alcohol
campaign shortly after taking office in March 1985 as a first
step to improving Soviet economic performance, which had been
seriously hurt by drunkenness among the working population.

against Fiji in response to that country's change of status to
a republic, acting prime minister Geoffrey Palmer said.
    The sanctions will end all military cooperation and cut
economic aid. New Zealand will also not renew an agreement
which supports the price of Fijian sugar when it expires in
March. The loss of aid and sugar supports will cost Fiji about
10 mln dlrs a year.
    Palmer told reporters after a cabinet meeting that the
government had asked High Commissioner Rod Gates to return from
Suva for discussions about other possible measures.
    "We won't be reacting further until these discussions with
the High Commissioner and the Prime Minister have been held,"
Palmer said.
    The sanctions were approved by the cabinet soon after
Colonel Sitivene Rabuka staged his second coup on September 25.
Implementation was postponed in the hope that Rabuka might turn
back from declaring a republic.
    Palmer said the cabinet was happy with the statement from
Commonwealth leaders in Vancouver that Fiji's membership of the
Commonwealth had lapsed. Prime Minister David Lange is in
Hawaii on his way home from Vancouver.
