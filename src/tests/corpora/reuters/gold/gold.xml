province of Heilongjiang rose 22.7 pct in 1986 from 1985's
level, the New China News Agency said. It gave no figures.
    It said the province, China's second largest gold producer
after Shandong, plans to double gold output by 1990 from the
1986 level. China does not publish gold production figures.
    However, industry sources estimate output at about 65
tonnes a year, with exports put between 11 and 31 tonnes.
    China is selling more gold abroad to offset large trade
deficits in recent years, western diplomats said.

    "OPEC's failure to address the recent decline in oil prices
remains a worrying factor however, and on balance it appears

ounce, following a statement by President Ronald Reagan that
the arms-for-hostages deal with Iran "was a mistake," dealers
said.
    Bullion rose to 409.40/90 dlrs from an initial low of
408.90/409.40. This compares with the opening of 409.00/50 and
New York's close of 410.00/50.
    Dealers noted mild short-covering in the metal after some
initial selling by local investors. Trading was fairly quiet
this morning partly owed to the slow U.S. Dollar activities,
they added.
    However, Reagan's remarks had only a short-lived bullish
impact on the gold price, which is now stabilising at 409.10/60

Rights will be traded on Australian stock exchanges from March
23 to April 22, and the new shares will be quoted from June 4.
    BHP said the new company will be one of Australia's larger
gold producers, with annual output exceeding 170,000 ounces. It

"Britannia," will be priced on the basis of the gold price on the
day of purchase plus a "competitive premium," Treasury officials
said.
    Value added tax will be levied on all purchases by members
of the U.K. Public, as is currently the case with foreign
coins, although transactions between members of the London Gold
Market and all exports of the coins will be zero-rated. No
decision has yet been taken on the face value of the coins.
    Although a number of gold coins, especially the Canadian
Maple, have been issued elsewhere in an attempt to take the
place of the South African krugerrand, the British government
still feels that there is a gap in the market for a British one
ounce gold coin. The only British gold coin available at
present is the sovereign, which contains 0.2354 ounces of gold.
    Gold from South Africa or the Soviet Union will not be used
in the coin, officials said, adding that bullion would be
bought on the world gold market. But analysts said it would be
difficult to ascertain the origins of such purchases.
    No details are yet available on how many coins will be
issued or how much gold will be bought, but traders said that
the amounts involved would be unlikely to move the gold price.
    There were some enquiries on the "Britannia" from coin
dealers today, but value added tax would prove a major factor
in the success of the coin, with the 15 pct tax likely to put
off many investors, traders said.

goldmine and boost annual output to almost one tonne within two
years from 600 pounds at present, said Li Sangsu, a spokesman
for <Unzan Mine Development Co>, the venture partner.
    Work will begin on April 3 and the company aims to increase
output to 10 tonnes within a decade to pay off Pyongyang's 70
billion yen debt to 30 Japanese companies, Li added.
    "We expect this mine to be worth about 2,000 billion yen in
gold deposits," he said.
    The mine, started in 1896 by a U.S. Company, is one of six
or seven virtually untapped mines in the Unzan area, 94 miles
north of Pyongyang, Li said.
    Li said modern equipment and advanced technology would
increase yields. "Up to now, the mining was done with antiquated
methods and basic equipment."
    The gold mine scheme is the latest in a series of moves by
North Korea to clear its debts to Japanese creditors.
    Earlier this year, Pyongyang tried and failed to pay off
part of its debt with several tonnes of fish.

buy gold, a vehicle which bankers say brings some of the play
of commodity options into the field of securities.
    Over the past three weeks, Swiss offices of American banks
have launched a total of four issues of warrants with varying
conditions, drawing on renewed inflationary worries and the
recovery of the gold price last year.
    And Credit Suisse and Credit Suisse-First Boston each
issued Swiss franc bonds with warrants for gold which have a
similar character, though they are aimed at a less professional
market.
    The market is still small. Taken together, the four
American-led warrant issues raised only about 50 mln Swiss
francs.
    But banks believe the vehicle meets a need of investors and
predicted a lively future.
    Andrew Barrett of Citicorp Investment Bank (Switzerland) AG
said: "The warrants give smaller investors a chance to have a
long-term investment in gold with limited risk."
    Citicorp in Zurich launched the first of these warrants on
February 27, following it up with a second issue less than a
week later. The issuer in both cases was Citibank NA.
    The idea found some quick copies. Goldman Sachs in Zurich
organized and co-led an issue for the Swiss branch of Banque
Indosuez on March 9 and last night Morgan Guaranty
(Switzerland) AG did another for Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of
New York.
    The four issues now offer investors striking prices for
gold ranging from the Indosuez issue at 410 dlrs an ounce, the
same price as the underlying commodity, to a 430 dlr level on
the first one for Citibank.
    The premiums range from 22 pct to 36 pct and maturities
from 18 months to four years and three months, in all cases
longer than gold futures and options on U.S. Markets.
    The bankers traced the inspiration for the market back to
the February report of U.S. Consumer prices for January, when a
jump of 0.7 pct raised again the threat of inflation.
    "Many people are worried about inflation again," said Mats
Joensson of Goldman Sachs. "Money supply in Germany and the
United States has grown very strongly in the last year and
people want to take a ride on gold."
    The gold market, having seen strong gains in 1986, has
languished just above 400 dlrs an ounce over the past few
weeks. But the banks saw in warrants the vehicle for a more
highly leveraged play where the downside risk was limited.
    Barrett said it was natural that the market developed in
Switzerland. "People here understand gold, and they understand
warrants," he said.
    Citicorp (Switzerland) pioneered warrants with a series of
equity-linked covered issues based on Japanese company shares
over the past two years, and last autumn, Swiss banks launched
covered warrants in Swiss registered shares in a bid to give
foreign investors a chance to play in a market otherwise closed
to all but Swiss citizens, and to play it with higher leverage.
    But after a quick flurry of issues, that market dried up
when Swiss shares prices fell from their January peaks.
    The issues are being marketed not on the basis of simple
premiums, but on implicit volatility models devised to provide
scientific comparisons between titles in the options market.
    Martin Bachem of Morgan Guaranty said his bank's issue was
competitive despite its relatively high premium. The issue, for
five ounces at 425 dlrs, was priced at 955 Swiss francs, making
a premium over the spot gold price of nearly 36 pct.
    Using a Black Sholes options model, he said the issue's
long, 4.3-year maturity meant the warrants needed an implicit
volatility of gold of only 24.5 pct for the option to pay off,
which he claimed was lower than the other issues.
    But Barrett said the Black Sholes variant Citicorp used
pointed to a higher volatily for the Morgan issue and
emphasized that the models were at best an inexact science.
    And each bank, using its own model, put the implicit
volatility needed for its own issue at close to 25 pct.
    Whatever the calculation, the issues have received a warm
welcome from investors.
    Joensson of Goldman Sachs said there was a lot of demand,
even among small investors, who were buying 15 or 20 warrants
apiece. "The most sophisticated ones wouldn't buy these because
the premiums are too high," he said.

following receipt of a feasibility study from Raytheon Co's
<RTN> Stearns Catalytic unit, it will proceed with construction

County, Idaho, as quickly as possible.
    The company said the study found proven ore reserves of
3,302,000 short tons grading 0.077 ounce of gold per ton.  It
said the mine will operate at a rate of 626,000 tons of ore per
year, with higher-grade ore being mined in the first three
years for a rapid payback of capital costs.
    The company said the feasibility study calls for gold
production averaging 41,000 ounces a year for the life of the
mine and 50,000 ounces a year over the first three years, with
99,000 ounces of silver per year being produced over the miune
life.
    Capital costs would be 22.3 mln dlrs with all-new equipment
and 500,000 to one mln dlrs less with used equipment, it said. 
It said the mine would be operated by a contract miner but the
associated mill by Geodome.
    Geodome said a new ore zone discovered last summer is not
included in reserve calculations. It said eight of the nine
holes drilled there have an average grade of 0.046 ounce of
gold and 2.1 ounces of silver per ton. Also excluded are
reserves of 1,400,000 tons of low-grade material that could be
milled profitably at 425 dlrs a ton for gold. The feasibility
study used a 350 dlr gold price.

here arrested five former senior executives of a bankrupt gold
deposit business group for defrauding about 450 clients of
about 1.5 billion yen for gold bars which were never delivered,
police said.
    The case involving the Toyota Shoji Company was highlighted
when its 32-year-old Chairman Kazuo Nagano was stabbed to death
here in public view in June, 1985.
    Television crews which had been waiting outside Nagano's
home filmed two men smashing their way into the home and later
emerging with a bloodstained bayonet.
    The company, established here in 1981, undertook to hold
gold on deposit for investors. It grew into a nationwide
business operation with 87 branch offices and 7,000 employees
at its peak in early 1985.
    Toyota Shoji's business group collected an estimated 200
billion yen from about 30,000 clients, many of them pensioners
and housewives, before the firm went bankrupt in July, 1985,
according to lawyers.
    Of them, some 18,000 clients cla imed they could get back
neither gold or money, suffering an aggregate loss of 150
billion yen, local press reports said.
    Police said the five arrested on charge of fraud today

sales are projected at 3.1 mln troy ounces in their first year
on the market, well above the target of 2.2 mln, Donna Pope,
director of the U.S. Mint, told journalists.
    World sales, which began on October 20, 1986, reached 2.193
mln ounces in less than six months of sales. This made it world
market leader with a share of 37 pct in 1986, Pope said.
    Pope said that in volume terms, nearly half of all gold
Eagle sales were within North America, roughly 40 pct were in
Europe and about eight pct in Asia.
    She said despite introduction of several new gold bullion
coins on the market recently, the Mint is aiming to preserve
the Eagle's strong market share with extensive publicity.
    The Mint uses mainly newly mined U.S. Gold for the coins,
as long as this is available at market prices. The remaining
gold is taken either from U.S. Treasury stocks, or from the
open market, Pope said.
    Gold analysts said the Eagle is facing competition here
from the Canadian Maple Leaf, and also to a lesser extent from
the South African Krugerrand. Some estimated the Maple Leaf's
West German market share at 60 pct.
    The figures may be distorted, as many German investors buy
gold bullion in Switzerland or Luxembourg to escape the 14 pct
value-added tax imposed here. Including the tax, the one-ounce
coins traded today at 906 marks, they said.
    Competition may also come from new gold coins, including
Belgium's ECU, which began sales today. Britain and Australia

could put a damper on the Tokyo market and encourage a shift of
trading to Hong Kong and Singapore, senior vice president and
Tokyo branch manager of Credit Suisse Paul Hofer told a press
conference.
    "If you impose five pct on both buy and sell transactions,
Tokyo participants in the gold market could be out of business,"
he said. The tax would create such a spread that Japanese would
be unable to compete in the international market, he added.
    "How can the government really raise taxes if the system
they impose is prohibitive of generating business?" he said.
    The government now imposes a 15 pct tax on physical trades
exceeding 37,500 yen for gold jewellery and coins and a 2.5 yen
tax per 10,000 yen on futures transactions, gold dealers said.
    The new five pct tax would be imposed on companies trading
more than 100 mln yen a year and apply to paper gold trades,
gold deposits with banks and trading of gold bars as well as
that of jewellery and coins, dealers said.
    However, the tax would lower the rate on jewellery and
coins to only five pct from the current 15 pct, they said.
    Hofer said in 1982 Switzerland had imposed a 5.6 pct gold
turnover tax on Jan 1, 1980, but abolished it on Oct 1, 1986.
    A study by one of the Swiss banks showed that in early
1980, the first year of the tax, the volume for all Swiss banks
fell by up to 25 pct compared with 1978 and 1979, Hofer said.
    Transactions of paper gold also fell up to 75 pct of the
volume prior to imposition of the tax, he said.
    While gold transactions in Switzerland decreased, the
volume of trades outside the country, particularly in London
and Luxembourg, increased between 10-25 pct, Hofer said.
    Japan is a major importer of gold, buying a yearly average
just under 200 tonnes, gold dealers said.
    Last year Japan imported about 600 tonnes of gold, but the
government had bought about 300 tonnes for minting coins to
commemorate the 60th year of Emperor Hirohito's reign, dealers
said.
    Gold trading in Tokyo is dominated mainly by Japanese
trading companies, while Credit Suisse is the major foreign
participant.
    Daily turnover in the Tokyo spot market ranges between one
and 10 tonnes with the average around three tonnes, while
futures turnover amounts to about four tonnes, gold dealers
said.
    "All of us are concerned daily with the fact that the Tokyo
market is growing, that Japan is becoming one of the three
major financial markets in the world ... And in my personal
opinion I think it would be a very big mistake to put a damper
on this positive growth or developments by imposing such a tax,"
Hofer said.
    "I don't think it fits the philosophy of an
internationalising market," he added.
    Officials of several major Japanese trading houses,
attending the press conference, said they supported Credit
Suisse's call for the government not to impose the gold tax.

to work after a week-long industrial action at South Africa's
largest gold mine, mine owner Anglo American Corp of South
Africa Ltd <ANGL.J> said.
    A spokesman for the mining house said the action started on
Wednesday last week when thousands of miners staged a go-slow
at One underground shaft of the Free State Geduld division of
Free State Consolidated Gold Mines Ltd <FSCN.J>.
    The action later escalated into an underground sit-in at
the mine over the weekend, prompting management to close the
affected shaft because of what the company described as "the
creation of unsafe working conditions."
    Anglo American spokesman John Kingsley-Jones said the
company held talks with the National Union of Mineworkers
(NUM), South Africa's biggest trade union which claims a
membership of 360,000 black workers, but failed to establish
the cause of worker dissatisfaction. He acknowledged that the
mine suffered a loss of production, but declined to give
estimates.
    Free State Consolidated last year produced 104 tonnes of
gold from 28 underground shafts.
    The NUM was not immediately available for comment on the
action. But a spokesman for the union earlier told the South
African Press Association that miners had been locked out of
the mine at the weekend after staging a strike in protest
against being ordered to carry bags containing explosives as
well as food for white miners.

    "We are looking at more options to acquire more reserves
rather than just exploration," Conger said adding, "the move to
consider acquisitions represents a change in the company's
acquisitions policy."
    Conger said all of Homestake's current cash position of 120

Homestake has two lines of credit totaling 150 mln dlrs which
have not been drawn on today and could be used to finance an

about the same as 1986 spending of 27.3 mln dlrs. Conger said
exploration for precious metals may be slightly higher than
last year's spending of 17.7 mln dlrs while oil and gas
exploration spending will be slightly less than last year's 9.6
pct.

the same as 1986 gold production of 669,594 ounces.
    However, 1987 first quarter production from its McLaughlin

 ]]></BODY><BODY><![CDATA[The glitter of gold has generated a
three-way competition among the world's largest futures
exchanges for a 100-ounce contract for the precious metal.
    When the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) re-introduces
gold futures trading here Tuesday (at 9 a.m. CDT), it will go
toe-to-toe in an uphill battle against the Commodity Exchange
Inc. of New York (Comex), which brokerage executives describe
as the world's precious metals futures capital for
institutional business.
    And by autumn, the oldest and biggest exchange, the Chicago
Board of Trade (CBT), expects to join the fray when the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) approves a pending
application for a 100-ounce gold contract to trade side-by-side
with the CBT's smaller, one kilogram (about 2.5 U.S. pounds)
gold futures.
    The CME introduced a 100-ounce gold futures contract in
1974, but lack of interest forced it to abandon the instrument
in July 1986.
    CME officials said investors and brokerage firms asked the
exchange to reintroduce the contract because of recent
volatility in precious metals. Other factors influencing the
decision may also have been clearing problems in May which
forced the Comex to shorten trading for three straight days in
an effort to clear up a huge backlog of unresolved trades,
especially in silver futures.
    Comex's problems may now create a window of opportunity for
other exchanges to successfully offer precious metals
contracts, industry sources say.
    But it is much too early to predict whether other exchanges
can inflict serious damage on the Comex' daily trading volume
of more than 40,000 contracts which represents commitments to
buy and sell gold of more than 2 billion dlrs.
    While average daily trading in the CBT's smaller gold
contract, aimed at retail customers rather than institutions,
was under 500 contracts per day throughout 1986, it has
surpassed 1,000 contracts daily for the past two months.
    "The climate could not be better for this venture by the
CME," said Merrill Lynch Commodity Marketing Vice President Neil
McGarrity.
    "Everybody is talking about metals now, and interesting
daily trading ranges provide opportunities for bulls and bears.
There's good trading volume in all world outlets," McGarrity
added.
    "The Merc's gold futures would be insurance for dealers,
merchants and customers that there would be a market open for
trading," if heavy gold or silver futures volume causes the
Comex to close early again, said Jack Lehman, senior vice
president and director of commodities for Shearson Lehman Bros.
Inc. and a Comex board member.
    Delivery points vary for each exchange's 100-ounce gold
futures. Comex contracts are deliverable through New York
warehouses while the CME contract specifies London delivery
through a CME account at Samuel Montagu and Co. Ltd., a member
of the London gold market. The CBT gold application specifies
delivery from New York and Chicago vaults.
    The Comex and the CBT have applied to the CFTC for an
earlier precious metals opening to match the CME's starting
time of 7:20 a.m. CDT. The exchanges said the earlier start
allows for trading before many important government reports are
released at 7:30 a.m. CDT.
    CME marketing sources said arbitrage possibilities exist
with side-by-side trading, noting local interests can be
generated by traders dealing in foreign currency and short-term
debt futures along with gold futures contracts to further hedge
their financial risks.
    "If the dollar rises, traders can sell currencies and buy
gold," said David Johnson, CME's manager of currency products.
    The Chicago Board of Trade sees an extra advantage to gold
trading. "Given our night trading session, we could add either
our pending 100-ounce gold or our existing 5,000-ounce silver
contract to attract overseas business," a CBT official said.
    Which market is identified as the precious metal capital
does not appear to be a major issue among professionals.
    "We've seen Chicago bring in a new constituency before, with
perhaps different needs," Mocatta Metals Chairman Dr. Henry
Jarecki said.
    "Merchants will go to the CME or anywhere to trade a liquid
contract. Our firm is no exception," Jarecki said.
    "At worst, even if the CME gold futures fail, the Comex will
be under pressure to improve the integrity of its clearing
processes," a CME official added.

mining claims in Alaska could produce revenues between 322 mln
dlrs and 966 mln dlrs from gold reserves.
    The range of the value of the reserves is attributed to the
wide range of grade estimates of the ore, the company said.
    A 1984 feasibility study put the grade at 0.008 ounces per
cubic yard, while subsequent exploration work proved that areas
of higher-grade gravel of up to 0.027 ounces/yard do exist,
Sphinx said.
    The claims are located 80 miles northwest of Fairbanks.

agreed with Saudi state agency General Petroleum and Mineral
Organisation (Petromin) to open a gold mine in Saudi Arabia to
exploit one of the world's richest deposits of the metal.
    Boliden spokesman Goran Paulson told Reuters the Swedish
group would  be responsible for the technical side of the
operation and would have no control over the product itself.
    He said one option under discussion for refining the gold
ore would be to ship it to Boliden's Ronnskar copper smelter in
northern Sweden.
    Paulson declined to give a figure for the deal but said it
was strategically important since it increased Boliden's
presence in Saudi Arabia.
    "Representatives from Petromin have visited Ronnskar
already...We see Saudi Arabia as the expansion area of the
future," he said.
    The new mine, which is being developed at Mahd adh Dhahab
in the west of the country and should open in the first half of
1988, would have an annual output of about 3,000 kilos of gold
smelted from around 120,000 tons of ore, he said.
    Boliden already owns 50 pct of a gold ore deposit in Saudi
Arabia, but the new venture will be the first Saudi mine to
open in modern times.
    "This is a breakthrough for Boliden's sales of mining
technology and knowhow," said the group's chief executive, Kjell
Nilsson.
