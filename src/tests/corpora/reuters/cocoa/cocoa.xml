the Bahia cocoa zone, alleviating the drought since early
January and improving prospects for the coming temporao,
although normal humidity levels have not been restored,
Comissaria Smith said in its weekly review.
    The dry period means the temporao will be late this year.
    Arrivals for the week ended February 22 were 155,221 bags
of 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5.93
mln against 5.81 at the same stage last year. Again it seems
that cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the
arrivals figures.
    Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to how
much old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has
practically come to an end. With total Bahia crop estimates
around 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln there
are a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers,
middlemen, exporters and processors.
    There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit
for export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in
obtaining +Bahia superior+ certificates.
    In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have
sold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment.
    Comissaria Smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350
cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos.
    Bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and
only limited sales were booked for March shipment at 1,750 to
1,780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named.
    New crop sales were also light and all to open ports with
June/July going at 1,850 and 1,880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrs
under New York july, Aug/Sept at 1,870, 1,875 and 1,880 dlrs
per tonne FOB.
    Routine sales of butter were made. March/April sold at
4,340, 4,345 and 4,350 dlrs.
    April/May butter went at 2.27 times New York May, June/July
at 4,400 and 4,415 dlrs, Aug/Sept at 4,351 to 4,450 dlrs and at
2.27 and 2.28 times New York Sept and Oct/Dec at 4,480 dlrs and
2.27 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said.
    Destinations were the U.S., Covertible currency areas,
Uruguay and open ports.
    Cake sales were registered at 785 to 995 dlrs for
March/April, 785 dlrs for May, 753 dlrs for Aug and 0.39 times
New York Dec for Oct/Dec.
    Buyers were the U.S., Argentina, Uruguay and convertible
currency areas.
    Liquor sales were limited with March/April selling at 2,325
and 2,380 dlrs, June/July at 2,375 dlrs and at 1.25 times New
York July, Aug/Sept at 2,400 dlrs and at 1.25 times New York
Sept and Oct/Dec at 1.25 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith
said.
    Total Bahia sales are currently estimated at 6.13 mln bags
against the 1986/87 crop and 1.06 mln bags against the 1987/88
crop.
    Final figures for the period to February 28 are expected to
be published by the Brazilian Cocoa Trade Commission after
carnival which ends midday on February 27.

prolonged dry spell on the coming Bahian temporao cocoa crop is
rising with trade forecasts generally in the 2.0 mln to 2.5 mln
bag range against 2.5 mln to 3.0 mln a fortnight ago.
    Trade sources told Reuters from the state capital of
Salvador that despite scattered rains since mid-February, which
broke a six week drought, plantations have not picked up as
hoped and very little cocoa is expected to be gathered in the
first three months of the May/September crop.
    The sources said arrivals from May through July might only
reach around 600,000 bags whereas in normal years a figure of
1.0 mln to 1.5 mln bags might be expected.
    Arrivals from then should start to pick up sharply as pods
from current flowering are gathered. However, the sources noted
a late temporao is always more susceptible to pod rot, which
flourishes if conditions turn cold and humid, and which is more
likely from late July on.
    This year's crop is doubly susceptible because poor prices
mean farmers were not encouraged to invest in fertilisers and
insecticides and are also unlikely to treat against pod rot.
    A severe attack of pod rot can cause the loss of over
500,000 bags in a very short period, one source said.
    Because of the increased exposure to pod rot damage,
estimates of the final outcome of the temporao are extremely
vulnerable and production could easily drop to below the 2.0
mln bag mark if the disease hits.
    Although flowering was good following the start of the
rains, pod setting was not up to expectations, possibly because
the drought had caused a drop in the insect population which
pollinates flowers, the sources said.
    However, reports from farms indicate moisture levels are
now generally back to near normal levels and that current
flowering and pod setting is good, which should result in
mature fruit from August through September.
    The sources said they expect no break in the harvesting of
beans between the end of the temporao and the beginning of the
main crop, which officially starts on October 1.
    "The cut-off date is completely artificial. If things go
well from now on we should see heavy harvesting without a break
from August through November or even December," one said.
    If predictions of a 2.0 to 2.5 mln bag temporao prove
accurate this would be below the 2.7 mln bag average for the
past 10 years. The last poor temporao was in 1984 when
prolonged drought and later pod rot cut production to 1.79 mln
bags, the lowest since 1974.
    Good growing conditions the following year produced a
temporao of 3.12 mln bags, just below the 1983 3.17 mln bag
record, while last year's output, which also suffered some
drought damage, was 2.77 mln bags.
    Figures for the coming temporao might be distorted upwards
by the inclusion of undeclared current main crop beans.
    The sources said large quantities of beans are believed to
have been undeclared from this year's record total harvest and
they were unsure how much of this would be unregistered by the
end of the official crop year on April 30.
    Recent official arrivals figures have been swollen by the
inclusion of beans which had been delivered previously to port
warehouses but not declared.
    Because of the high turnover of beans this year,
significant amounts have deteriorated because they were stored
too long at the back of warehouses. Some of these are expected
to be held for mixing in with early temporao arrivals.
    With official arrivals figures for the 1986/87 temporao and
main crops totalling over 6.1 mln bags, and over seven weeks
still to go to the end of the year, the total outturn should be
at least a record 6.5 mln bags if all production is declared,
the sources said.
    This would compare with the previous record set last year
of 6.03 mln.
    However, there is no way of telling how many current crop
beans will be declared after the May 1 start of the temporao
and thus the true size of the 1986/87 harvest may never be
officially registered.

stabilise fluctuating commodity prices will again be put to the
test over the next two weeks as countries try to agree on how a
buffer stock should operate in the cocoa market, government
delegates and trade experts said.
    Only two weeks ago, world coffee prices slumped when
International Coffee Organization members failed to agree on
how coffee export quotas should be calculated. This week, many
of the same experts gather in the same building here to try to
agree on how the cocoa pact reached last summer should work.
    The still unresolved legal wrangle surrounding the
International Tin Council (ITC), which had buffer stock losses
running into hundreds of millions of sterling, is also casting
a shadow over commodity negotiations.
    The ITC's failure has restricted negotiators' ability to
compromise as governments do not want to be involved in pacts
with built-in flaws or unlimited liability, but want clear
lines drawn between aid and trade.
    A more hopeful sign of cooperation was agreement on basic
elements of a new International Natural Rubber Agreement in
Geneva at the weekend.
    Some importing countries insist the International Cocoa
Organization (ICCO) buffer stock rules must not be muddied with
quota type subclauses which might dictate the type of cocoa to
be bought. One consumer country delegate said this would
"distort, not support" the market.
    Trade and industry sources blame uncertainty about the ICCO
for destabilising the market as the recent collapse in coffee
prices has made traders acutely aware that commodity pacts can
founder. On Friday this uncertainty helped push London cocoa
futures down to eight month lows. The strength of sterling has
also contributed to the recent slip in prices.
    The ICCO daily and average prices on Friday fell below the
"must buy" level of 1,600 SDRs a tonne designated in the pact,
which came into force at the last ICCO session in January but
without rules for the operation of the buffer stock.
    Consumers and producers could not agree on how it should
operate and what discretion it should be given. The agreement
limits it to trading physical cocoa and expressly says it
cannot operate on futures markets.
    A cash balance of some 250 mln dlrs and a stock of almost
100,000 tonnes of cocoa, enough to mount large buying or
selling operations, were carried forward from the previous
agreement.
    Members finance the stock through a 45 dlrs a tonne levy on
all cocoa they trade. It has an upper limit of 250,000 tonnes.
    The key arguments being faced by the ICCO working group on
buffer stock rules which is meeting today and tomorrow will be
over non-member cocoa and differentials the buffer stock should
pay when trading different types of cocoa. Another working
group is scheduled to meet Wednesday to discuss administrative
matters, and the full council meets on Thursday.
    Producers have so far maintained that buffer stock funds
should not help mop up surplus cocoa produced in non-member
countries such as Malaysia.
    Consumers say when this cocoa is the cheapest the buffer
stock should buy it rather than compete with chocolate
manufacturers for premium-priced high quality cocoas.
    The argument over buying non-member cocoa is closely linked
to the one over differentials for different qualities.
    European industry and trade advisers have suggested as a
compromise that the buffer stock have a maximum share that can
represent non-member cocoa and that it use the London futures
market's existing differentials for different qualities.
    Currently, good West African cocoa is tendered at par onto
the London market.
    Discounts, which are currently under review, range up to 50
stg a tonne for Brazilian and Malaysian cocoa.
    Consumer delegates said the same arguments in reverse would
operate when prices are high - the buffer stock should sell the
highest priced cocoa in most demand, forcing all prices lower.
    The January talks were slowed by a split inside the
European Community, a key ICCO consumer group, with France
siding with producers. EC representatives met in closed session
in Brussels on Friday in an attempt to reach a common ground
and, a diplomatic source said, narrowed the range of positions
among the 12 nations.
    The source said the EC will be looking for signs of
flexibility on the part of producers in the next few days and
will be able to respond if they are there.
    One ICCO delegate describing the producer/consumer split
said consumer proposals mean buying more cocoa for less and
backs the concept of the pact which is "meant to support the
market where trade buying is not."
    In contrast, he said, producers seem to want to sell their
cocoa to the buffer stock rather than consumers.
    Other, more technical, issues still outstanding include
whether the buffer stock should buy at a single announced
"posted price" as in the previous pact or by announcing it is
buying then accepting offers.
    In either case, delegates said, it is accepted that
producers must be given a clear opportunity to make offers of
cocoa for forward shipment directly to the buffer stock in a
way that is competitive with spot offers made by dealers.

countries at an International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, council
meeting here have edged closer to a unified stance on buffer
stock rules, delegates said.
    While consumers do not yet have a common position, an
observer said after a consumer meeting, "They are much more
fluid ... and the tone is positive."
    European Community consumers were split on the question of
how the cocoa buffer stock should be operated when the ICCO met
in January to put the new International Cocoa Agreement into
effect, delegates said.
    At the January meeting, France sided with producers on how
the buffer stock should operate, delegates said. That meeting
ended without agreement on new buffer stock rules.
    The EC Commission met in Brussels on Friday to see whether
the 12 EC cocoa consuming nations could narrow their
differences at this month's meeting.
    The Commissioners came away from the Friday meeting with an
informal agreement to respond to signs of flexibility among
producers on the key buffer stock issues, delegates said.
    The key issues to be addressed at this council session
which divide ICCO members are whether non-member cocoa should
be eligible for buffer stock purchases and what price
differentials the buffer stock should pay for different types
of cocoa, delegates said.
    A consumer delegate said producers and consumers should be
able to compromise on the non-member cocoa question.
    A working group comprising delegates from all producing and
consuming member countries met briefly this morning, then broke
up into a producer meeting and an EC meeting, followed by a
consumer meeting.
    Producers, who are in favour of the buffer stock buying a
variety of grades of cocoa and oppose non-member cocoa being
accepted, reviewed their position ahead of the working group
meeting this afternoon.
    "We are waiting to see what consumers say," a producer
delegate said. "We hope they will be flexible or it will be
difficult to negotiate."
    The ICCO comprises 33 member countries. Non-
members include the U.S., a consumer, and Malaysia, an
increasingly important producer.

ICCO, council adjourned after presenting divergent producer and

delegates said.
    ICCO Executive Director Kobena Erbynn will draw up what
some delegates called a "pre-compromise" and present it to the
buffer stock working group at 1130 hrs GMT Tuesday, they said.
    While consumer and producer member nations disagree how a
buffer stock should be implemented, both sides reiterated they
were willing to compromise to come to agreement, they said.
    "I am optimistic we will be able to come to an agreement --
maybe not tomorrow or the next day, but some time later in the
session," a consumer delegate said.
    Producers say they want the buffer stock to consist only of
ICCO member cocoa, comprise a representative basket of various
grade cocoas and pay different prices for different grades,
delegates said.
    Some consumers would rather the buffer stock manager be
able to buy non-member cocoa also, and pay a single price for
the buffer stock cocoa without respect to origin.
    Consumer members were not unified in their views on how the
buffer stock should operate, with several countries backing
different aspects of the producer stance, delegates said.
    The semi-annual council meeting is scheduled to run until
March 27. Consideration of the buffer stock rules is the most
controversial topic on the agenda, delegates said.

 ]]></BODY><BODY><![CDATA[The International Cocoa Organization,
ICCO, buffer stock working group began examining a draft
proposal for buffer stock rules this afternoon, delegates said.
    The plan, presented by ICCO Executive Director Kobena
Erbynn, represented a compromise between producer, European
Community, EC, and other consumer views on how the buffer stock
should operate, they said.
    The proposal involved three key principles. First, the
buffer stock manager would be open to offers for cocoa rather
than using fixed posted prices as previously, delegates said.
    Under an offer system, the buffer stock manager would be
free to choose cocoas of varying prices, they said.
    The second provision was that non-ICCO member cocoa could
comprise a maximum 10 pct of the buffer stock, while the third
laid out a pricing system under which the buffer stock manager
would pay differentials for different grades of cocoa, to be
set by a formula, the delegates said.
    After the plan was presented, working group delegates met
briefly in smaller groups of producers, EC consumers and all
consumers to look at the proposal. Producers gave no reaction
to the scheme and will respond to it when the working group
meets tomorrow at 1000 GMT, producer delegates said.
    Consumer members accepted the proposal as a good base to
work from, one consumer delegate said.
    Delegates said the proposal was only a starting point for
negotiations on buffer stock rules and subject to change.

caution to today's developments at the International Cocoa
Organization talks in London, saying there is still time for
negotiations to break down.
    "I would be extremely cautious to go either long or short
at this point," said Jack Ward, president of the cocoa trading
firm Barretto Peat. "If and when a final position comes out (of
the ICCO talks) one will still have time to put on positions.
The risk at the moment is not commensurate with the possible
gain."
    ICCO producer and consumer delegates this morning accepted
the outlines of a compromise proposal on buffer stock rules as
a basis for further negotiation. A smaller group of
representatives is now charged with fleshing out the details.
    "Market sentiment has reflected optimism, I would't put it
any stronger than that," Ward said.
    "It seems to put them slightly closer to an agreement...
but one shouldn't forget how much they have to negotiate," said
another trader of today's developments.
    Many dealers were sidelined coming into the negotiations
and have remained so, traders said.
    "The dealers have got historically small positions in
outright terms," one trader said.
    Speculators have gone net long "but only slightly so," he
added.
    The recent price strength -- gains of about 52 dlrs the
last two days -- has been due in large part to sterling's rally
against the dollar and in the process has attracted a measure

buffer stock rules at an International Cocoa Organization,
ICCO, council meeting which opened here today, delegates said.
    Both producer and consumer ICCO members said after the
opening session that prospects for an agreement on the cocoa
market support mechanism were improving.
    "The chances are very good as of now of getting buffer stock
rules by the end of next week," Ghanaian delegate and producer
spokesman Mama Mohammed told journalists.
    Consumer spokesman Peter Baron called the tone of the
negotiations "optimistic and realistic."
    The ICCO council failed to agree on buffer stock rules when
a new International Cocoa Agreement came into force in January,
with deep differences of opinion precluding serious discussions
on the matter at that time. The existing buffer stock of about
100,000 tonnes of cocoa was frozen, with a funds balance of 250
mln dlrs.
    The ICCO made buffer stock rules negotiations a priority at
this semi-annual council meeting in order to stop the slide in
world cocoa prices.
    Consumers and producers agreed yesterday on the principles
as a basis for negotiations.
    The council broke for lunch, and reconvenes at 1500 hrs. A
working group which has been meeting since Monday will tackle
the buffer stock rules issue again at 1600 hrs, when ICCO
executive director Kobena Erbynn presents a fleshed-out version
of a draft proposal he prepared earlier this week, delegates
said.
    Mohammed said delegates will have a much clearer indication
of prospects for an accord after details of the rules are
elaborated by Erbynn, and after producers and consumers meet
separately later today to examine the scheme.
    The draft proposal included three principles: a limit to
non- member cocoa comprising the buffer stock, an offer system
for buying buffer stock cocoa, and price differentials to be
paid for various cocoas making up the buffer stock, delegates
said.
    During the morning council session, the Ivory Coast
delegation gave "an open minded statement" that it is willing to
work out a buffer stock rules solution which could come into
effect as soon as possible, Baron said.
    Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon, chairman of
the ICCO council, was now expected to arrive in London Monday
to attend the talks, Baron said. Vice chairman Sir Denis Henry
of Grenada chaired the meeting in his place.

(ICCO) moved closer to an agreement on buffer stock rules, with
many delegates saying they expect to reach an accord by Friday.
    "Everyone is convinced the buffer stock rules should be in
place by Friday so the buffer stock can be put into operation
Monday," a consumer delegate said. "The atmosphere is excellent."
    Other delegates said the buffer stock might not be
operational by Monday but could be in place by around April 1,
if the rules are agreed by Friday.
    A detailed package on how the buffer stock manager will buy
and sell cocoa was presented to a buffer stock working group
this afternoon -- a big step toward a "very interesting stage of
negotiations," delegates said.
    The package, based on negotiating principles informally
agreed by delegates, has been forged bit by bit during
fortnight-long meetings by ICCO Executive Director Kobena
Erbynn and a small group of other delegates.
    Producers, the European Community (EC) and consumers are
scheduled to consider the paper separately and then jointly
tomorrow.
    Under the proposal, the buffer stock manager would buy
cocoa from origins or the second-hand market on an offer
system. He would alert the market via news agencies as to when
he wanted to buy cocoa and include shipment details and tonnage
desired, delegates said.
    The manager would buy cocoa on a competitive basis, rather
than choosing the cheapest cocoa as before, giving preference
to ICCO member-country exporters. Standard price differentials
would be fixed for each origin, similar to golf handicaps, to
determine the relative competitiveness of offers of various
cocoas from different origins, they said.
    The differentials could be reviewed at the request of a
member country or recommendation of the buffer stock manager,
the delegates said. Revision would be decided by a majority
vote of the ICCO council.
    Buffer stock purchases from non-ICCO member countries would
not be allowed to exceed 10 pct of the total buffer stock, they
said.
    The purchases would be limited to 5,000 tonnes of cocoa per
day and 20,000 tonnes per week, and could be bought in nearby,
intermediate and forward positions, they added.
    One of the underlying ideas of the rules package is
"transparency," meaning virtually all the buffer stock manager's
market activities will be public and he will have as little
discretion as possible, delegates said.
    After the tin market collapse in 1985, when the
International Tin Council buffer stock ran out of funds, cocoa
delegates are anxious to install safeguards in the cocoa market
mechanism, they said.
     Earnest debate on the buffer stock proposal is expected to
begin late tomorrow, as delegations feel the pressure of the
approaching Friday deadline, when the ICCO meeting is due to
adjourn, delegates said.
    The ICCO failed to agree buffer stock rules in January when
the new International Cocoa Agreement came into force. The
existing buffer stock of 100,000 tonnes of cocoa was frozen in
place with its bank balance of 250 mln dlrs -- both untouchable
until rules are agreed.
     Though the current semi-annual council meeting is not the
last chance for delegates to cement buffer stock rules,
producers are keen to get the wheels of the market-stabilizing
mechanism turning to stem the decline in world prices,
delegates said.

talks on buffer stock rules have slowed during a crucial phase
of negotiations, delegates said, but they remained confident
about prospects for reaching agreement by Friday.
    Cocoa producers, European Community (EC) consumers and all

stock rules package distributed yesterday.
    The buffer stock working group of consumers and producers
was set to meet later today to debate the proposal jointly for

    Delegates said major sticking points were likely to be the
amount of non-member cocoa allowed to be bought for the buffer
stock, and the fixed price differentials at which different
origin cocoas will be offered to the buffer stock manager.

    Bra Kanon is expected to meet with about eight delegations

    Despite remaining differences delegates remained confident
a buffer stock accord would be agreed to by Friday when the
council session ends, but certain technical points need further
clarification, the delegates said.
    Certain consumers are concerned that differentials included
in the draft buffer stock package are out of line with market
realities, consumer delegates said.
    Unless these are modified there are fears it would promote
purchases of quality cocoas, such as Ghana origin, which are
normally required by manufacturers, they said.
    Restrictions on buffer stock purchases of non-member cocoa
might lead to a supply overhang in Malaysian cocoa, which would
depress prices, they added.

council chairman Denis Bra Kanon will present a compromise
proposal on buffer stock rules to producer and consumer
delegates either later today or tomorrow morning, delegates
said.
    Bra Kanon held private bilateral consultations with major
producers and consumers this morning to resolve outstanding
differences, mostly on the issues of how much non-member cocoa
the buffer stock can purchase and price differentials for
different varieties.
    Delegates were fairly confident the differences could be
worked out in time to reach agreement tomorrow.
    Some consuming member nations, including Britain and
Belgium, favour the buffer stock buying more than 10 pct
non-member cocoa, delegates have said.
    The consumers argue that buying cheaper, lower quality
non-member cocoas, particularly Malaysian, will most
effectively support prices because that low quality cocoa is
currently pressuring the market.
    Producers, meanwhile, say non-member cocoa should make up
at most a very small percentage of the buffer. They say
Malaysia should not be able to benefit from the ICCO unless it
is a member, and if the buffer stock bought Malaysian cocoa
Malaysia would have no incentive to join, delegates said.
    As to differentials, Ghana apparently wanted a higher
differential for its cocoa than is outlined in the most recent
proposal, so it would have a better chance of having its cocoa
bought for the buffer stock, producer delegates said.
    Some consumers wanted differentials to be adjusted in a way
that would not promote buffer stock purchases of the more
expensive cocoas, such as Ghanaian and Brazilian, they said.
    Other technical points need to be sorted out, including
limits on how much cocoa the buffer stock manager can buy in
nearby, intermediate and forward positions and the consequent
effect on prices in the various deliveries, delegates said.

buffer stock rules presented by International Cocoa
Organization, ICCO, council chairman Denis Bra Kanon is swiftly
gaining acceptance by consumer and producer members, delegates
said.
    "We are close, nearer than ever to accepting it, but we
still have some work to do," producer spokesman Mama Mohammed of
Ghana told Reuters after a producers' meeting.
    European Community, EC, delegates said EC consumers
accepted the package in a morning meeting and predicted "no
problems" in getting full consumer acceptance.
    Delegates on both sides are keen to come to some agreement
today, the last day of the fortnight-long council meeting, they
said.
    The compromise requires that buffer stock purchases from
non-ICCO member countries cannot exceed 15 pct of total buffer
stock purchases, delegates said. The non-member cocoa issue has
been among the most contentious in the rules negotiations.
    The 15 pct figure, up five percentage points from earlier
proposals, represents a concession to consumers, delegates
said. They have demanded a larger allowance for non-member
cocoa in the buffer stock than producers have wanted.
    Another problem area, delegates said, was the question of
price differentials for different origins of cocoa bought into
the buffer stock, by which the buffer stock manager could
fairly compare relative prices of different cocoas offered to
him.
    The compromise narrowed the range of differentials between
the origins from what previous proposals had detailed -- a move
some delegates described as "just fiddling."
    But the adjustments may prove significant enough to appease
some countries that were not satisfied with the original
proposed differentials assigned to them, delegates said.
    The compromise also stated buffer stock purchases on any
day would be limited to 40 pct each in nearby, intermediate or
forward positions, delegates said.
    If the compromise is accepted by the council, most
consumers and producers want buffer stock rules to take effect
next week, or as soon as practically possible.

(ICCO) Council reached agreement on rules to govern its buffer

    The date on which the new rules will take effect has not
been decided but delegates said they expected them to come into
force early next week, after which the buffer stock manager can
begin buying or selling cocoa.
    Since prices are below the "may-buy" level of 1,655 Special
Drawing Rights a tonne set in the cocoa pact, the manager is
likely to buy cocoa sooon to support the market, they said.
    Delegates and traders said they expected the manager,
Juergen Plambeck, to intervene in the market within three weeks
of the pact coming into force.
    The rules permit him to buy and sell cocoa from origins or
the second hand market on an offer system, not by means of a
posted price as in the previous cocoa accord.
    The cocoa will be priced according to a fixed set of
differentials, ranging from 137 stg for most expensive Ghana
cocoa to zero for Malaysian cocoa.
    Purchases from non-members, such as Malaysia, will be
limited to 15 pct of the total stock and those on any one day

 ]]></BODY><BODY><![CDATA[The buffer stock rules agreement reached
on Friday by the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) is an
improvement on previous arrangements but the price-support
mechanism is unlikely to do more than stem the decline in cocoa
prices, many ICCO delegates and trade sources said.
    The accord was reached between producers and consumers of
the 35-member ICCO council after two weeks of talks.
    European chocolate manufacturers and delegates said the
accord may boost cocoa prices immediately, but world surpluses
overhanging the market will pull prices down again before long.
    "If the buffer stock operation is successful, I doubt it
will do anything more than stop the price from falling further,
and it will have no relevance at all to retail chocolate
prices," a European dealer said.
    And if the buffer stock manager delays too long in buying,
or is not seen to be using his purchasing power when the market
is relying on him to do so, the bearish trade reaction could
pressure prices dramatically, dealers said.
    The buffer stock is the market-regulating tool of the ICCO,
into which cocoa can be bought or from which it can be sold to
manoeuvre prices into a pre-set stabilization range.
    A new cocoa agreement came into force in January but
delegates could not agree buffer stock rules at that time.
    The new rules take effect immediately. The buffer stock
manager is expected to begin buying cocoa within the next three
weeks, after organizing communications with cocoa producing
countries and assessing the market, since prices are below the
"must-buy" level of 1,600 Special Drawing Rights per tonne
specified in the agreement, the sources said.
    The buffer stock theoretically has funds to buy a maximum
100,000 tonnes within a five week period, but its approach will
be more cautious, buffer stock manager Juergen Plambeck said.
    The buffer stock has around 250 mln dlrs in funds and a
buying limit of 250,000 tonnes of cocoa, 100,000 tonnes of
which are already in the buffer stock.
    ICCO council chairman and Ivorian Agriculture Minister
Denis Bra Kanon said the new rules have a good chance of
stabilizing prices. Ivory Coast is the world's largest cocoa
producer.
    "We have established rules which will permit us to withdraw
immediately the surplus of cocoa on the world market," Bra Kanon
told reporters after the council adjourned. Bra Kanon reckoned
the world cocoa surplus could be less than half the 94,000
tonnes estimated by the ICCO statistics committee.
    However, some producer and consumer members emerged from
the final ICCO council meeting with reservations about the
pact.
    Ghana, whose high-quality cocoa is the world's most
expensive and provides 60 pct of the country's export earnings,
made a formal protest to the council about the price
differentials assigned to its cocoa, saying they were too high
for Ghanaian cocoa to be bought for the buffer stock.
    According to consumer spokesman Peter Baron of West
Germany, "Consumers weren't perfectly happy with the buffer
stock rules. We reached a very sensitive compromise...There
were no real winners or losers."
    Some European Community delegates were not satisfied that
important points were fully discussed during the talks, and as
a result, doubted the rules can deal with world surpluses as
effectively as they could have, delegates said.
    Under the new rules, the buffer stock manager would seek
offers of different origin cocoas, using price differentials to
reflect different qualities. Non-ICCO member cocoa can comprise
up to 15 pct of the total buffer stock.
    London cocoa prices traded today around 1,300 stg per
tonne, down from around 1,450 stg in January 1987 and 1,750 stg
in January 1986.
    A cocoa withholding scheme can take a further 120,000
tonnes of cocoa off the market if a special council session
decides market conditions warrant it, according to the
agreement.
    The withholding scheme can only be used if prices fall
below the 1,600 SDR lower intervention price for more than five
days and if 80 pct of the maximum buffer stock capacity has
been filled, or if the buffer stock runs low on funds, it says.
    The ICCO will discuss withholding scheme rules at an
executive committee meeting on June 9/12, ICCO officials said.

May/September temporao harvest in Brazil's main cocoa growing
state of Bahia are now in the 1.5 mln to 2.0 mln 60-kilo bag
range against 2.0 mln to 2.5 mln two weeks ago.
    Traders in the state capital Salvador told Reuters the
effects of a dry period in the first six weeks of the year had
been harsher than thought earlier.
    Although good flowering had followed the onset of rains in
mid-February subsequent pod setting was dissappointing.
    Last year's temporao, also hit by a dry spell, was 2.77 mln
bags. In 1984 severe drought cut the crop to 1.79 mln bags.
    The traders said another factor leading to lower crop
predictions is that many farmers are not caring properly for
plantations because of low returns on their investment.
    Manpower, fertiliser and other costs have been cut back as
farmers feel the pinch of the rise in interest rates over the
past six months coupled with low bean prices.
    If such economies continue into the winter months both the
temporao and the developing October/April main crop could face
serious damage from pod rot attacks on trees which would
normally be treated against the disease.
    Recent very wet weather has already caused some isolated
incidences of pod rot but reports from the growing regions say
these are not yet significant.
    The traders said they expect very low deliveries of
temporao beans in the first three months of the harvest and the
bulk will not appear until the last month, September.
    Despite the low loads, trees are said to be in excellent
condition and recent flowering and pod setting - which will
lead to late temporao/early main crop beans - has been good.

major cocoa producer, have declined to say whether it will join
the International Cocoa Agreement (ICCA) for which buffer stock
rules were agreed in London last week.
    Ministry of Primary Industries officials said in January
the cabinet would decide on Malaysia's participation, but so
far a decision has not been announced. The government is said
to be in favour of joining the pact, but local cocoa growers
and traders told Reuters they are against the idea because
certain provisions in it may be to their disadvantage.
    Malaysia is the world's fourth largest cocoa producer. The
government feels that the pact, through its buffer stock
mechanism, can help stabilise prices in a market which is
labouring under surpluses, officials said.
    But growers and traders are concerned Malaysia's
participation in the pact will require them to pay a levy for
exports of cocoa to non-member countries of the ICCA.
    They estimate the levy at around 100 ringgit a tonne at
current prices and said they are not prepared to accept it
because a big portion of Malaysia's cocoa exports, officially
estimated at 112,000 tonnes in 1986, goes to non-members.
    Most growers and traders added they are also against a
buffer stock measure under the agreement which requires
withholding of cocoa stocks when prices slump.
    Malaysia, which produced 117,000 tonnes of cocoa last year,
might be forced to withhold up to 70,000 tonnes worth some 30
mln ringgit under such a measure in the long-term, and this
might affect their economic viability, they said.
    "The cost of maintaining such a stock can be high and it
will be a real messy business for the government and the trade
if it ever occurs," an industry source said.
    The growers and traders also said that under new buffer
stock rules Malaysia can continue to benefit even if it is not
a member of the pact, as the buffer stock manager is also
allowed to buy from non-members for the stockpile.
    Under the new rules purchases from non-members, such as
Malaysia, will be limited to 15 pct of the total stock.
    Malaysia has come under pressure from some producers to
join the pact soon, officials said, but they noted that it need
not rush to do so as there are provisions which allow countries
to join the agreement even at a later date.

(ICCO) buffer stock could face an uphill battle to halt the
downtrend in world cocoa prices when it begins buying
operations in the next few weeks, cocoa traders said.
    Traders said they believed buffer stock purchases could
reach 75,000 tonnes in a matter of weeks without lifting prices
significantly, given the amount of surplus cocoa overhanging
the market. The buffer stock may begin buying shortly as the
ICCO 10 day average indicator price is now at 1,578.03 Special
Drawing Rights (SDR) per tonne, below the 1,600 "must buy" level.
    Rules governing buffer stock operations were agreed last
month by the ICCO council. Buying will begin once the buffer
stock manager has completed preparations, traders said.
    Some traders said the buffer stock manager may delay buffer
stock buying until mid or end-April when changes in months used
to calculate the ICCO indicator may lift the 10 day average
above the 1,600 SDR "must buy" level.
    The ICCO indicator price is calculated from the average of
the second, third and fourth positions on the London and New
York futures markets. The daily price was 1,577.61 SDR per
tonne yesterday.
    Months used currently for the indicator are May, July and
September, but these are set to change to July, September and
December on April 15, prior to May becoming the New York spot
month, traders noted.
    The introduction of December into the calculations may lift
the daily SDR price as December is currently quoted about 75
stg above May on the London terminal market.
    But the buffer stock manager would have to wait for the
higher daily price to feed through into the 10-day average, the
indicator which governs his activities, traders said.
    "The buffer stock manager is obviously looking at the
implications of delaying until forward prices lift the
indicator since it might mean he has to buy less cocoa," an
analyst from a leading cocoa trade house said.
    Traders said the buffer stock purchases could reach 75,000
tonnes fairly quickly once buying starts. If purchases reach
this level within six months, buying is suspended pending an
ICCO council review of price ranges. But some cocoa market
watchers said the buffer stock may benefit from recent
forecasts for a poor Brazilian Bahia temporao crop at 1.5 mln
to two mln 60 kilo bags against initial expectations of up to
three mln.
    A lower than expected Brazilian crop may cut the 1986/87
world surplus to between 50,000 and 70,000 tonnes, compared
with a recent forecast by the ICCO statistics committee of
94,000 tonnes, traders said.
    In these circumstances, the buffer stock may only need to
buy between 20,000 and 30,000 tonnes to lift prices above the
"must buy" level.
    But some dealers said the ICCO buffer stock rules may put
constraints on how quickly and effectively the buffer stock
manager can remove cocoa from the market.
    The buffer stock system of price differentials set
according to quality and a 15 pct limit on purchases from
non-members could limit the buffer stock's scope for action,
dealers said.
    Most of the cocoa readily available to the buffer stock is
nearby in-store material of Malaysian and Ivory Coast origin.
    But the buffer stock can only buy 15 pct Malaysian cocoa as
Malaysia is not an ICCO member, while purchases of nearby cocoa
can only reach 40 pct in any one day, which forces the buffer
stock to buy some intermediate and forward shipment material.
    Limits on buffer stock purchases of nearby and non-member
cocoa will reduce the impact on terminal prices which are
pressured by the overhang of Malaysian material, traders said.
    Buffer stock purchases of forward shipment cocoa from
quality producers such as Ghana will have only a limited impact
on futures, but is likely to widen physical market premiums for
this cocoa over futures.
    Ghana's premium to the terminal has risen to about 50 stg
from 25 to 30 stg a month ago partly in anticipation of buffer
stock buying, dealers said.
    "The buffer stock may not help the terminal market, but will
provide a backstop for quality cocoas," one trader said.
    Traders cautioned that views on the impact of the buffer

predict accurately what the result would be. Psychologically
buffer stock buying should help prices, but since the buffer
stock already holds a carryover of 100,000 tonnes from the
previous cocoa agreement and the market is in surplus, dealers
expressed doubts purchases can counter bearish pressure.
    In June the ICCO is due to discuss rules for a withholding
scheme as an additional market support mechanism.

limit sales in the weeks ahead in an effort to boost world
prices, sources close to a meeting of the Cocoa Producers
Alliance (CPA) said.
    The sources said the depressed world market had been one of
the main topics discussed in a closed door meeting of the
11-member CPA which began on Monday.
    They said producers agreed that cutting sales would aid the
buffer stock manager of a new international cocoa pact in his
effort to support prices.
    Major cocoa producing and consuming nations agreed
operation rules for the buffer stock at a meeting in London
last month and the stock manager is expected to enter the
market soon.
    Prices, under the weight of three successive cocoa
surpluses, recently fell to the level at which the manager has
to buy cocoa under stock rules.
    The buffer stock aims to keep prices within a pre-set range
by buying when prices fall and selling when they rise.
    "The world's cocoa price at present is just not interesting,"
commented one delegate representing a major CPA producer.
    Another source said that with much of the 1986/87
(October-September) world cocoa crop sold, limiting sales in
the near term concerns essentially next year's harvest.
    The sources noted, however, that the cocoa industry in
Brazil, the world's number two producer, is in private hands.
This means limiting sales is more difficult than in major West
African producers, where sales are made or authorized by
commodity marketing boards.
    The CPA includes the world's top three producers, Ivory
Coast, Brazil and Ghana, and accounts for 80 pct of all output.
    The meeting here is due to end tomorrow evening.

contracts will be reduced by 25 pct as from Friday, April 10,
taking the required deposit for one 10 tonne lot to 300 stg

    The deposit for spread contracts will be similarly cut, to
150 stg for a one 10 tonne lot from 200 previously, he said.
    The ICCH had been looking at cocoa market fluctuations over
a period of weeks, he said, adding the market's basic stability
had warranted a cut in deposit rates.
    The decision to cut deposits was taken by the ICCH after
consultation with the London Cocoa Terminal Market, the

likely to follow the example of Cocoa Producers Alliance, CPA,
members, who may limit sales of the product in an effort to
boost world prices, trade sources said.
    They said a similar procedure was taken in the past in
Brazil and that it did not work out according to plans.
    "The cocoa market is completely free. Unlike coffee, which
is controlled through export registrations, cocoa exporters in
Brazil operate at their own free will," a trade source said.
    The traders were responding to questions whether they would
follow the example of CPA members meeting in Yaounde.
    The sources said the Banco do Brasil's Foreign Trade
Department, CACEX, never interferes in the cocoa market by
rejecting sales that do not meet certain price or shipment
criteria.
    "The position of local producers is always to negotiate as
they please. If they buy for ten and sell for eleven and think
it's a good deal, they are free to go ahead," one source added.

the intermittent buying activities of the International Cocoa
Organization's buffer stock manager, industry sources told
Reuters.
    "The way he is operating at the moment is doing almost
nothing to support the market. In fact he could be said to be
actively depressing it," one company spokesman said.
    Including the 3,000 tonnes he acquired on Friday, the total
amount of cocoa bought by the buffer stock manager since he
recently began support operations totals 21,000 tonnes.
    Despite this buying, the price of cocoa is well under the
1,600 Special Drawing Rights, SDRs, a tonne level below which
the bsm is obliged to buy cocoa off the market.
    "Even before he started operations, traders estimated the
manager would need to buy at least up to his 75,000 tonnes
maximum before prices moved up to or above the 1,600 SDR level,
and yet he appears reluctant to do so," one manufacturer said.
    "We all hoped the manager would move into the market to buy
up to 75,000 tonnes in a fairly short period, and then simply
step back," he added.
    "The way the manager is only nibbling at the edge of the
market at the moment is actually depressing sentiment and the
market because everyone is holding back from both buying and
selling waiting to see what the manager will do next," one
processor said.
    "As long as his buying tactics remain the same the market is
likely to stay in the doldrums, and I see no indication he is
about to alter his methods," he added.
    Processors and chocolate manufacturers said consumer prices
for cocoa products were unlikely to be affected by buffer stock
buying for some time to come.

    The scarcity of beans because of the effects of drought on

say some producers there are dismayed by the ineffective action
so far by the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) buffer
stock manager on buffer stock purchases.
    One trader said some West African producers are annoyed the
Buffer Stock manager is not playing his part as required by the
International Cocoa Pact to stabilise prices from current lows.
    So far, only 21,000 tonnes of second hand cocoa have been
taken up for buffer stock purposes and this, traders noted,
only on an intermittent basis.
    They noted the purchases, of 8,000 tonnes in the first week
he bought and 13,000 in the second, are well short of the
limitations of no more than 5,000 tonnes in one day and 20,000
in one week which the cocoa agreement places on him.
    The traders recently returned from West Africa say
producers there are unhappy about the impact on cocoa prices so
far, noting producing countries are part of the international
cocoa pact and deserve the same treatment as consumers.
    London traders say terminal market prices would have to
gain around 300 stg a tonne to take the ICCO 10-day average
indicator to its 1,935 sdr per tonne midway point (or reference
price).
    However, little progress has been made in that direction,
and the 10-day average is still well below the 1,600 sdr lower
intervention level at 1,562.87 from 1,569.46 previously.
    The buffer stock manager may announce today he will be
making purchases tomorrow, although under the rules of the
agreement such action is not automatic, traders said.
    Complaints about the inaction of the buffer stock manager
are not confined to West African producers, they observed.
    A Reuter report from Rotterdam quoted industry sources
there saying Dutch cocoa processors also are unhappy with the
intermittent buffer stock buying activities.
    In London, traders expressed surprise that no more than
21,000 tonnes cocoa has been bought so far against total
potential purchases under the new agreement of 150,000 tonnes.
Carryover holdings from the previous International Cocoa
Agreement in the stock total 100,000 tonnes.
    Terminal prices today rose by up to 10 stg a tonne from
Friday's close, basis July at its high of 1,271.
    It seems that when the buffer stock manager is absent from
the market, prices go up, while when he declares his intention
to buy, quite often the reverse applies, traders said.

International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) will tender for about
3,000 tonnes of cocoa beans Wednesday, June 3, the ICCO said in
a statement.
    It said all other conditions remain unchanged from the
previous announcement.
    These conditions are that offers from registered companies
should be in pounds sterling for cocoa beans for which standard
differentials have been set in the ICCO's buffer stock rules,
and can be for cocoa afloat through to December shipment and
spot to December arrival/delivery.
    The basis position will be afloat, May/July shipment or
June arrival/delivery. For later positions the appropriate
carrying costs will be taken into account.
    The deadline for the receipt of offers by the manager shall
be 1330 hrs london time (1230 gmt) in the case of offers
emanating from the secondhand market and 1400 hours in the case
of offers emanating from the origins.
    The competitiveness of offers will be assessed by taking
into account the standard differentials, the cost of taking
cocoa into store (currently 23.00 pounds sterling from "cif
landed" and 38.00 pounds sterling from "cif shipping weights"
to "in store") and the cost of carry which currently is 12.00

famine in certain areas near its border with Togo following
scant rainfall, Accra Radio reported today.
    The Radio, monitored in Abidjan, said fishing and farming
activities have been disrupted in certain districts around the
Volta region near the eastern coast.
    The report follows a period of unusually dry weather in
both Ghana and the Ivory Coast, which trade sources in Abidjan
said could pose problems for important developing cocoa crops.
    The Accra Radio report said a Ghanaian government
delegation, which visited the Anglo and Ketu districts last
week to investigate reports of food shortages, promised the
people a regular supply of maize, rice and sugar.
    At Anglo, the delegation was told that the Keta Lagoon had
dried up, halting fishing activities, while catches at sea were
poor and crops had failed, all due to lack of rainfall.

have affected Ivory Coast 1987/88 main crop cocoa prospects,
although good precipitation in the last half of June and in
July could still reverse the situation, trade sources said.
    They said the crop is still likely to be fairly large and
it is too early to determine the consequences of the dry spell
on the harvest.
    "This year's crop will probably be another good one. It is
impossible to tell how flowering is going, but there should be
no problems unless something drastic happens," one trader said.
    Private forecaster Accu-Weather reported today that most
Ivory Coast cocoa growing regions were without rain over the
weekend and similar weather will persist today and Tuesday.
    "Rain would be welcomed, as the past week has been quite
dry, except along the western portion of the coast," it said.
    Traders agreed rain was needed, but some noted that the dry
conditions had not affected the entire country.
    The Ivorian Meteorological Office could not be reached for
comment or recent statistics. The trade sources said rainfall
in recent weeks was likely insufficient for cocoa plants,
although it is difficult to assess what the minimum
requirements are.
    Trade sources said there had been good rains in late
January, February and March which helped to promote flowering,
but April and May were fairly dry in most areas except in the
south west of the country.
    The Ivory Coast mid-crop should have been covered by
March/April rains but the main crop, still in its formation
period, depends largely on rainfall from April through July.
    The main rains normally last between May and July, before
returning again in September/October. "Flowering has been less
than normal and if the trees are not carrying that much at the
moment, then they have a chance to recover," one trader said.
    Another trade source noted the flowers still had plenty of
time to develop and the rains were "not good but still not bad."
    The sources said that while the weather might emerge as a
cause for concern, crop conditions in West Africa were
presently taking a back seat to other factors in the
international cocoa market.
    This is not only because of the premature nature of any
harvest predictions but also because of the supply of cocoa
already burdening the market, they said.
    "With a third year of surplus overhanging the market and the
buffer stock failing to boost prices despite regular purchases,
the weather has not been a factor," one private consultant said.
    London-based dealer Gill and Duffus said in its April cocoa
market report the current 1986/87 Ivory Coast crop was likely
to total 570,000 tonnes, which compares with a record 1985/86
crop estimate of 585,000 tonnes.

output despite depressed world prices and they dismiss
suggestions in the London market that their cocoa is inferior.
    "Leading cocoa producers are trying to protect their market
from our product," said a spokesman for Indonesia's directorate
general of plantations. "We're happy about our long-term future."
    Malaysian growers said they would try to expand sales in
Asia and the United States if Malaysian cocoa was not suitable
for European tastes.
    They were responding to comments by London traders that
large tonnages of unwanted cocoa beans from Malaysia, Indonesia
and Papua New Guinea (PNG) were helping to depress cocoa
prices.
    London traders said the Asian cocoa was considered
unsuitable for western palates because of an acrid odour and a
high level of free fatty acids.
    Ng Siew Kee, the chairman of Malaysia's Cocoa Growers'
Council, said Malaysia should expand its sales to Asia and the
United States if it did not produce a type suitable for Western
Europe.
    A spokesman for the PNG Cocoa Industry Board said the
London market was mistaken if it linked PNG cocoa with
high-acid Malaysian and Indonesian beans.
    "When the market is declining, buyers seize on anything to
talk down prices," the spokesman said.
    He said that PNG could sell whatever cocoa it produces.
    PNG exported 33,000 tonnes of cocoa in the 1986/87 cocoa
year ending September 30, of which nearly 50 pct was exported
to West Germany, 16 pct to the U.S. And the rest to the
Netherlands and Britain.
    The Indonesia spokesman, an Agriculture Ministry official
who wished not to be identified, said Indonesia had no problem
with quality and would continue to expand sales. He described
criticism of the quality of Indonesian beans as "trade politics"
and said Jakarta's traditional links with Dutch buyers meant it
did not have any difficulty with exports.
    Indonesia and Malaysia, Asia's two biggest commodity
producers, are expanding cocoa output and are both outside the
International Cocoa Organization (ICCO).
    Officials have said Malaysian production is expected to
total 150,000 to 155,000 tonnes in calendar 1987.
    This is up from 131,000 tonnes in 1986, partly because of
the end of a three-year drought in Sabah, the country's largest
cocoa growing area.
    Production of Indonesian cocoa beans tripled to 31,600
tonnes in calendar 1986 from 10,284 tonnes in 1980. Output is
projected to rise to 50,000 tonnes in 1988 from 38,000 tonnes
this year as young trees mature.
    Both Malaysia and Indonesia are low cost producers and
traders said they could last out low prices longer than West
African countries.
    According to one Kuala Lumpur trader, world prices would
have to fall another 1,000 ringgit per tonne (about 250 stg) to
make cocoa production in Malaysia uneconomic.
    Some traders believe the main quality problem is with
harvesting and fermentation techniques.
    One trader said Malaysian cocoa is virtually
indistinguishable from West African output if treated in the
same way but this is not possible on the larger Malaysian
estates.
