global coffee export quotas have been extended into today, with
sparks flying yesterday when a dissident group of exporters was
not included in a key negotiating forum.
    The special meeting of the International Coffee
Organization (ICO) council was called to find a way to stop a
prolonged slide in coffee prices.
    However, delegates said no solution to the question of how
to implement quotas was yet in sight.
    World coffee export quotas -- the major device used to
regulate coffee prices under the International Coffee Agreement
-- were suspended a year ago when prices soared in reaction to
a drought which cut Brazil"s output by nearly two thirds.
    Brazil is the world"s largest coffee producer and exporter.
    Producers and consumers now are facing off over the
question of how quotas should be calculated under any future
quota distribution scheme, delegates said.
    Tempers flared late Saturday when a minority group of eight
producing countries was not represented in a contact group of
five producer and five consumer delegates plus alternates which
was set up to facilitate debate.
    The big producers "want to have the ball only in their court
and it isn"t fair," minority producer spokesman Luis Escalante of
Costa Rica said.
    The majority producer group has proposed resuming quotas
April 1, using the previous ad hoc method of carving up quota
shares, with a promise to try to negotiate basic quotas before
September 30, delegates said.
    Their plan would perpetuate the status quo, allowing Brazil
to retain almost all of its current 30 pct share of the export
market, Colombia 17 pct, Ivory Coast seven pct and Indonesia
six pct, with the rest divided among smaller exporters.
    But consuming countries and the dissident producer group
have tabled separate proposals requiring quotas be determined
by availability, using a formula incorporating exportable
production and stocks statistics.
    Their proposals would give Brazil a smaller quota share and
Colombia and Indonesia a larger share, and bring a new quota
distribution scheme into effect now rather than later.
    Brazil has so far been unwilling to accept any proposal
that would reduce its quota share, delegates said.
    Delegates would not speculate on prospects for agreement on
a quota package. "Anything is possible at this phase," even
adjournment of the meeting until March or April, one said.
    If the ICO does agree on quotas, the price of coffee on the
supermarket shelf is not likely to change sinnificantly as a
result, industry sources said.
    Retail coffee prices over the past year have remained about
steady even though coffee market prices have tumbled, so an
upswing probably will not be passed onto the consumer either,
they said.

(ICO ) council talks on reintroducing export quotas continued
with an extended session lasting late into Sunday night, but
delegates said prospects for an accord between producers and
consumers were diminishing by the minute.
    The special meeting, called to stop the prolonged slide in
coffee prices, was likely to adjourn sometime tonight without
agreement, delegates said.
    The council is expected to agree to reconvene either within
the next six weeks or in September, they said.
    The talks foundered on Sunday afternoon when it became
apparent consumers and producers could not compromise on the
formula for calculating any future quota system, delegates

Coffee Organization (ICO) council failed to agree on how to set
coffee export quotas, ICO delegates said.
    Producers and consumers could not find common ground on the
issue of quota distribution in eight days of arduous, often
heated talks, delegates said.
    Export quotas -- the major device of the International
Coffee Agreement to stabilise prices -- were suspended a year
ago after coffee prices soared in reaction to a drought in

 ]]></BODY><BODY><![CDATA[The failure of the International Coffee
Organization (ICO) to reach agreement on coffee export quotas
could trigger a massive selloff in London coffee futures of at
least 100 stg per tonne today, coffee trade sources said.
    Prices could easily drop to as low as 1.00 dlr or even 80
cents a lb this year from around 1.25 dlrs now, they said.
    A special meeting between importing and exporting countries
ended in a deadlock late yesterday after eight days of talks
over how to set the quotas. No further meeting to discuss
quotas was set, delegates said.
    Quotas, the major device used to stabilize prices under the
International Coffee Agreement, were suspended a year ago after
prices soared following a damaging drought in Brazil.
    With no propects for quotas in sight, heavy producer
selling initially and a price war among commercial coffee
roasting companies will ensue, the trade sources predicted.
    Lower prices are sure to trickle down to the supermarket
shelf this spring, coffee dealers said.
    The U.S. And Brazil, the largest coffee importer and
exporter respectively, each laid the blame on the other for the
breakdown of the talks.
    Jon Rosenbaum, U.S. Assistant trade representative and
delegate to the talks, said in a statement after the council
adjourned, "A majority of producers, led by Brazil, were not
prepared to negotiate a new distribution based on objective
criteria.
    "We want to insure that countries receive export quotas
based on their ability to supply the market, instead of their
political influence in the ICO."
    Brazilian Coffee Institute (IBC) President Jorio Dauster
countered, "Negotiations failed because consumers tried to
dictate quotas, not negotiate them."
    Previously, quotas were determined by historical amounts
exported, which gave Brazil a 30 pct share of a global market
of about 58 mln 60-kilo bags. A majority of producers wanted
quotas to continue under this basic scheme.
    But most consumers and a maverick group of eight producers
proposed carving up the export market on the basis of
exportable production and stocks, which would reduce Brazil's
share to 28.8 pct.
    Consumer delegates said this method would reflect changes
in many countries' export capabilities and make coffee more
readily available to consumers when they need it.
    A last-minute attempt by Colombia, the second largest
exporter, to rescue the talks with a compromise interim
proposal could not bring the two sides together.
    Delegates speculated Brazil's financial problems,
illustrated by its recent suspension of interest payments on
bank debt, have increased political pressure on the country to
protect its coffee export earnings.
    Developing coffee-producing countries that depend heavily
on coffee earnings, particularly some African nations and
Colombia, are likely to be hurt the most by the ICO's failure
to agree quotas, analysts said.
    The expected drop in prices could result in losses of as
much as three billion dlrs in a year, producer delegates
forecast.
    The ICO executive board will meet March 31, but the full
council is not due to meet again until September, delegates
said.

prices, following the breakdown late last night of negotiations
in London to reintroduce International Coffee Organization,
ICO, quotas, will be short-lived, Dutch roasters said.
    "The fall is a technical and emotional reaction to the
failure to agree on reintroduction of ICO export quotas, but it
will not be long before reality reasserts itself and prices
rise again," a spokesman for one of the major Dutch roasters
said.
    "The fact is that while there are ample supplies of coffee
available at present, there is a shortage of quality," he said.
    "Average prices fell to around 110 cents a lb following the
news of the breakdown but we expect them to move back again to
around 120 cents within a few weeks," the roaster added.
    Dutch Coffee Roasters' Association secretary Jan de Vries
said although the roasters were disappointed at the failure of
consumer and producer ICO representatives to agree on quota
reintroduction, it was equally important that quotas be
reallocated on a more equitable basis.
    "There is no absolute need for quotas at this moment because
the market is well balanced and we must not lose this
opportunity to renegotiate the coffee agreement," he said.
    "There is still a lot of work to be done on a number of
clauses of the International Coffee Agreement and we would not
welcome quota reintroduction until we have a complete
renegotiation," de Vries added.
    With this in mind, and with Dutch roasters claiming to have
fairly good forward cover, the buying strategy for the
foreseeable future would probably be to buy coffee on a
hand-to-mouth basis and on a sliding scale when market prices
were below 120 cents a lb, roasters said.

map out a fresh common strategy following the failure of the
International Coffee Organization, ICO, to reach agreement on
export quotas, Gilberto Arango, president of Colombia's private
coffee exporters' association, said.
    Arango told Reuters that the most intelligent thing now
would be to seek a unifying stand from producers, including
Brazil, in order to map out a strategy to defend prices.
    An ICO special meeting ended last night in London with
exporting and consuming nations failing to agree on a
resumption of export quotas, suspended one year ago after
prices soared following a prolonged drought in Brazil.
    Arango said there would be no imminent catastrophe but
predicted that over the short term prices would undoubtedly
plummet.
    However, he said the market should also take into account
evident factors such as Brazil's low stocks and the sale of the
near totality of the Central American crop.
    Trade sources said Colombia's coffee was today quoted at
1.14 dlrs a lb in New York, its second lowest price in the past

    Cardenas said these countries apparently fail to understand

    It is difficult to believe that while efforts are made to
solve the problem of the developing world's external debt,
decisions are being taken which cut earnings used for repaying
those debts, he said.

while we try to effectively combat drug trafficking, countries
which support us in this fight seek to cut our jugular vein,"

Peru coffee crop and producers are looking forward to a record
harvest, the president of one of Peru's four coffee cooperative
groups said.
    Justo Marin Ludena, president of the Cafe Peru group of
cooperatives which accounts for about 20 pct of Peru's exports,
told Reuters a harvest of up to 1,800,000 quintales (46 kilos)
was expected this year. He said Peru exported 1,616,101
quintales in the year to September 1986.
    A spokesman for the Villa Rica cooperative said flood
waters last month had not reached coffee plantations, and the
crop was unaffected.
    Floods in early February caused extensive damage in Villa
Rica, whose coffee cooperative exported 59,960 quintales last
year, according to the state-controlled coffee organisation.
    Marin said the rains would only affect the coffee crop if
they continued through to next month, when harvesting starts.
    He said Peruvian producers were hoping for an increase this
year in the 1.3 pct export quota, about 913,000 quintales,
assigned to them by the International Coffee Organisation, ICO.
    He said Peru exported 1,381,009 quintales to ICO members

235,092 quintales, valued at around 35 mln dlrs, to non-ICO

to bring exporting and importing countries once more round the
negotiating table to discuss export quotas, ICO delegates and
traders said.
    The failure last night of International Coffee
Organization, ICO, producing and consuming countries to agree
export quotas brought a sharp fall on international coffee
futures markets today with the London May price reaching a
4-1/2 year low at one stage of 1,270 stg per tonne before
ending the day at 1,314 stg, down 184 stg from the previous
close.
    The New York May price was down 15.59 at 108.00 cents a lb.
    Pressure will now build up on producers returning from the
ICO talks to sell coffee which had been held back in the hope
the negotiations would establish quotas which would put a floor
under prices, some senior traders said.
    The ICO 15 day average price stood at 114.66 cents a lb for
March 2. This compares with a target range of 120 to 140 cents
a lb under the system operating before quotas were suspended in
February last year following a sharp rise in international
prices caused by drought damage to the Brazilian crop.
    In a Reuter interview, Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC,
President Jorio Dauster urged producers not to panic and said
they need to make hard commercial decisions. "If we have failed
at the ICO, at least we have tried," Dauster said, adding "now it
is time to go and sell coffee."
    But Brazil is keeping its marketing options open. It plans
to make an official estimate of the forthcoming crop next
month, Dauster said. It is too difficult to forecast now. Trade
sources have put the crop at over 26 mln bags compared with a
previous crop of 11.2 mln. Brazil is defining details of public
selling tenders for coffee bought on London's futures market
last year.
    A basic condition will be that it does not go back to the
market "in one go" but is sold over a minimum of six months.
    The breakdown of the ICO negotiations reflected a split
between producers and consumers on how to set the yardstick for
future quotas. Consumers said "objective criteria" like average
exports and stocks should determine producer quota shares,
Dauster said.
    All elements of this proposal were open to negotiation but
consumers insisted they did not want a return to the "ad hoc" way
of settling export quotas by virtual horse trading amongst
producers whilst consumers waited in the corridors of the ICO.
    Dauster said stocks and exports to ICO members and
non-members all need to be considered when setting quotas and
that Brazil would like to apply the coffee pact with a set
ratio of overall quota reflecting stock holdings.
    It is a "simplistic misconception that Brazil can dictate"
policy to other producers. While consumer countries are welcome
to participate they cannot dictate quotas which are very
difficult to allocate as different "objective criteria" achieve
different share-outs of quota, Dauster said.
    Other delegates said there was more open talking at the ICO
and at least differences were not hidden by a bad compromise.
    Consumer delegates said they had not been prepared to
accept the producers' offer to abandon quotas if it proves
impossible to find an acceptable basis for them.
    "We want the basis of quotas to reflect availability and to
encourage stock holding as an alternative to a buffer stock if
supplies are needed at a later stage," one delegate said.
    Some consumers claimed producer support for the consumer
argument was gaining momentum towards the end of the ICO
session but said it is uncertain whether this will now collapse
and how much producers will sink their differences should
prices fall further and remain depressed.
    The ICO executive board meets here March 30 to April 1 but
both producer and consumer delegates said they doubt if real
negotiations will begin then. The board is due to meet in
Indonesia in June with a full council scheduled for September.
    More cynical traders said the pressure of market forces and
politics in debt heavy Latin American producer countries could
bring ICO members back around the negotiating table sooner than
many imagine. In that case quotas could come into force during
the summer. But most delegates and traders said quotas before
October are unlikely, while Brazil's Dauster noted the ICO has
continued although there were no quotas from 1972 to 1980.
    A clear difference between the pressures already being felt
by importers and exporters was that consumers would have been
happy to agree on a formula for future quotas even if it could
not be imposed now. At least in that way they said they could
show a direct relationship between quotas and availability.
    In contrast producers wanted stop-gap quotas to plug the
seemingly bottomless market and were prepared to allow these to
lapse should lasting agreement not be found.
    "Producers were offering us jam tomorrow but after their
failure to discuss them last year promises were insufficient
and we wanted a cast iron commitment now," one consumer said.

 ]]></BODY><BODY><![CDATA[Failure of talks on re-establishing
International Coffee Organization, ICO, coffee quotas last week
may put political pressure on the United States, particularly
the State Department, to reassess its position, but the U.S. is
unlikely to back away from its basic demand quotas be set by
"objective criteria", U.S. officials said.
    Jon Rosenbaum, assistant U.S. trade representative and head
of Washington's delegation to the talks, told Reuters on his
return from London that the United States is willing to resume
the coffee negotiations as early as April if necessary.
    Rosenbaum said the United States will be "flexible" in
discussing the method of establishing objective criteria and
any transition to new quotas, but not on the basic aim of
establishing an objective method of setting quotas.
    At the ICO talks major consuming nations, led by the U.S.,
proposed that future coffee export quota shares be calculated
by a formula incorporating a producer's recent exportable
production and verified stocks, while large producers led by
Brazil proposed maintaining the traditional ad hoc division of
shares. The consumer position would have in effect reduced the
market share of Brazil, by far the world's largest producer.
    Rosenbaum said the administration would continue to support
legislation now before Congress which would allow the U.S.
customs service to monitor coffee imports, as a way to comply
with any future coffee quotas.
    He said the Reagan administration would be reviewing the
coffee policy situation following the collapse of the London
talks, but "nobody is proposing we change our position."
    However, other U.S. government officials involved in coffee
policy said they are bracing for a diplomatic and coffee market
offensive from producer countries, led by Brazil and Colombia,
to soften the consumer position.
    "Knowing that its next crop is fairly large, Brazil will
kind of want to test the resolve of other producers and
consumers," said one U.S. official.
    The U.S. official, who asked not to be identified, said
Brazil and Colombia may flood the coffee market in the next few
months in an effort to drive down prices and pressure other
countries, particularly the splinter group of small producers
who differed with the major producers in London.
    This in turn could lead to urgent appeals from Latin
American countries, faced with mounting debt problems, to the
U.S. State department, and to the National Security Council in
the White House, for an easing of the U.S. position, U.S.
officials said.
    The State department, a major player in setting U.S. coffee
policy, may then face conflicting pressures, particularly from
politically-sensitive U.S. allies in Central America, U.S.
officials said.
    El Salvador and Guatemala both backed Brazil and Colombia
at the London talks in resisting pressures for quotas based on
objective criteria. But the Dominican Republic and Costa Rica
joined the splinter group, which said it would agree to
objective criteria.
    There is a strong feeling among some in the State
Department that the United States should continue to support
the splinter group of producers who have taken the
politically-risky step of opposing Brazil on the objective
criteria question, U.S. officials said.
    Within the consuming countries there also is expected to be
some pressure to reassess positions.
    In London, the U.S. was supported by the U.K., the
Netherlands, West Germany, Japan, Australia and New Zealand on
the issue of objective criteria, U.S. officials said.
    This bloc represented enough votes among consuming nations
to successfully prevent adoption of the producer proposals.
    However, U.S. sources said West Germany's support was at
times qualified and there is some concern that the European
Community could come under pressure to be more accommodative to
producers in future talks. France backed the Ivory Coast and
other African producers during the talks.
    A softening of the EC stance would make it more difficult,
although not impossible, for the U.S. to block producer plans.
    While political manuevering by small producers and
consuming countries will be important, U.S. officials said the
key to any future outcome will be Brazil's position.
    U.S. officials blamed Brazil's intransigence for the
failure of the talks and said a more flexible position from
Brasilia would be the most important step toward agreement.

blamed an inflexible U.S. position for the failure of last
week's International Coffee Organisation, ICO, talks on export
quotas.
    "We understand that the U.S. Position was more inflexible
than the one of Brazil, where current economic and political
factors make it difficult to adopt certain positions," Gaviria
told Reuters in an interview.
    The U.S. and Brazil have each laid the blame on the other
for the breakdown in the negotiations to re-introduce export
quotas after being extended through the weekend in London.
    Gaviria stressed that Colombia tried to ensure a successful
outcome of the London talks but he deplored that intransigent
attitudes, both from producing and consuming nations, made it
impossible.
    In a conversation later with local journalists, Gaviria
said the U.S. attitude would have serious economic and
political consequences, not necessarily for a country like
Colombia but certainly for other Latin American nations and for
some African countries.
    He told Reuters that Colombia, because of the relatively
high level of its coffee stocks, would probably suffer less.
    According to Gaviria, Colombia can hope to earn about 1,500
mln dlrs this calendar year from coffee exports, which
traditionally account for 55 pct of the country's total export
revenue.
    That estimate would represent a drop in revenues of 1,400
mln dlrs from 1986.
    Colombia, which held stockpiles of 10.5 mln bags at the
start of the current coffee year, exported a record 11.5 mln
bags in the 1985/86 coffee year ending last September 30.

new coffee export quotas within the International Coffee
Agreement, ICA, was preferable to the alternative of Brazil
having a sharply reduced quota, as had been proposed, President
of the Rio de Janeiro Coffee Trade Association Carlos Calmon
said.
    He told Reuters proposals to reduce Brazil's quota to 25
pct of the world share from 30 pct at present were unacceptable
as the country has large stocks and a good harvest is expected.
    "Brazil has the capacity to export 20 mln bags this year,"
Calmon added.
    Calmon said, assuming a 58 mln bag global ICA quota,
Brazil's share under the proposals would have been 14.5 mln
bags, of which soluble would have accounted for 2.0 mln,
leaving just 12.5 mln bags of green coffee for export.
    "It's a pity the talks broke down, but for Brazil this was
better than such a quota reduction," he added.
    In 1985 Brazil exported 19.6 mln bags of soluble and green
coffee, including about two mln bags to non-members. A severe
drought and marketing problems cut exports last year to under
10 mln bags.
    Calmon estimated stocks as of January 1 at 18 mln bags, of
which 5.0 mln have already been sold for export. The harvest
this year should be around 30 mln bags, he added.
    The latest Brazilian Coffee Institute estimate for last

it was higher than this.

    "I am convinced the market is going to reverse by April," he
told a news conference here at his return from the failed
London talks.
    Robusta coffee beans for May delivery ended the day in
London down about 50 sterling at 1,265 sterling a tonne, the
lowest since 1982.
    Bra Kanon estimated at at least 535 billion CFA francs
(1.76 billion dlrs) the overall loss in revenues earned by
Ivory Coast from all its commodities exports this year if the
slide on the world markets continues.
    He disclosed that his country - the world's biggest cocoa
producer and the third largest for coffee -- would spearhead an
African initiative to reach a compromise formula by the end of
next month.
    Ivory Coast has been chosen by the Abidjan-based
Inter-African Coffee Organisation (IACO) to speak on behalf of
the continent's 25 producer nations at the London talks.
    "An initiative from IACO is likely very soon," he said
without elaborating.
    "Following the London collapse, we have immediately embarked
on a concertation course to avoid breaking an already fragile
market," he said.
    Questioned by journalists, the minister said President
Felix Houphouet-Boigny estimated for the moment that his
government would not be forced to reduce the price guaranteed
by the state to Ivorian coffee-growers for the current season.
    Last year, the West African nation announced that the
coffee producer price would stay at 200 CFA francs (65 cents)
per kilo.
    Bra Kanon said that his country would strive to diversify
its agricultural production to avoid beeing too dependent from
world market fluctuation.
    A communique read over the state-run television tonight
said that during today's weekly cabinet meeting, the veteran
Ivorian leader reaffirmed "his faith in Ivory Coast's bright
(economic) future" despite the commodities price slide.
    The Agriculture Minister also announced the government
decided to earmark a sum of 7.5 billion CFA francs (24.71 mln
dlrs) to support the country's small farmers.
    Financially-strapped Ivory Coast, long regarded as one of
Africa's showpiece economies, is going through difficult times
following the sharp slump in the world price of cocoa and
coffee.
    Ivory Coast's real gross domestic product is expected to
grow only one pct this year compared to five pct in 1986,
according to a recent Finance Ministry estimate.

its coffee exports following this week's breakdown of
International Coffee Organization talks on export quotas,
President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC, Jorio Dauster
said.
    He told a press conference Brazil now had to reconsider its
export plans and that the 15.5 mln bag export figure which it
had proposed for itself earlier should no longer be taken as
the country's export target to ICO-member countries.
    The 15.5 mln bag offer had been made on the assumption an
agreement would bring stability to world markets, he added.
    It had been a gesture to ease negotiations, but the lack of
an agreement leaves it no longer valid and exports could be
above or below 15.5 mln bags, he said.
    Dauster said he would talk to producers, exporters and
market analysts before taking any decision on export policy,
but any future policy would be flexible and adjusted to market
conditions.
    "We will not take any short-term decisions which might cause
markets to panic," Dauster added.
    He said it would be a policy which shows Brazil has coffee
to sell and that it could do so without an ICO agreement.
    "Brazil has coffee (to sell) and wants to show that it does
not need an ICO agreement as a crutch," Dauster said.
    Commenting on the breakdown of the talks, Dauster said
consumer proposals would have implied a reduction of one to two
mln bags in Brazil's export quotas.
    "It was a proposal which would lead to a substantial loss
for Brazil and which would be difficult for the country to
recover," he said.
    The consumer proposal to base quotas on a six-year moving
average of exportable production surpluses would lead to
overproduction as countries boosted output to win higher
quotas, he said.
    Dauster rejected reports which said Brazil's inflexibility
had been the cause for the breakdown of talks, noting that its
stance had the backing of 85 pct of producing countries.
    Close links would continue with these producers,
particularly Colombia, Mexico and Francophone African
countries, but Dauster said no joint marketing action was
envisaged at present.
    He also said Brazil currently had no plans to return to a
system of roaster buying contracts, although "no hypothesis has
been abandoned."
    Dauster said he had not yet decided when registrations for
May shipment coffee will be opened.
    He declined comment on whether the IBC will adopt a policy
of opening registrations for up to six months in advance, as
some exporters had suggested.
    He noted export registrations for the first four months of
the year totalled around 5.5 mln bags, more than half the 9.9
mln exported in 1986 when drought reduced the crop to between
11.2 mln and 12 mln bags.
    He said that, although he had heard forecasts of 30 mln
bags for the coming crop, the IBC would not make any estimate
until late April.

    He said the current depression on world coffee markets was
not totally unexpected and would have no immediate bearing on
Colombia's financial state which he described as sound.
    "Our foreign debt is high, but we can pay and I hope the

    Colombia, the only major latin american country not to have

of 13.6 billion dlrs.
    Calls for a rescheduling of the debt have come this week
from the opposition conservative party and the biggest trade
union following the coffee price drop. Gaviria said lower
coffee prices this year could mean a loss of 1.5 billion dlrs
in revenues for 1987.

sees new hope for winning changes in the International Coffee
Organisation system of export quotas.
    Minister Luis Diego Escalante, who serves as president of
the Costa Rican Coffee Institute, said he was hopeful because
of the support offered Costa Rica and other smaller producing-
nations by such major consumers as the United States, Britain
and the Netherlands at last week's ICO meeting in london.
    Escalante told a news conference here he "carried the weight
of the negotiations" at the meeting by calling for larger export
quotas for the smaller coffee-growing nations.
    Costa rica is insisting, Escalante said, on a new quota
system based on a producing nation's real export capacity, once
it has satisfied internal demand.
    "There are countries such as our own whose sales
possibilities are close to or above 100 pct of their current
quotas," Escalante said.
    At the same time, there are countries favoured by the
current system that have been assigned quotas far above their
export potential, he said.
    The current ICO quota system is "unfair and autocratic,"
Escalante said.
    Escalante attributed the nosedive in international coffee
prices over the last week to speculation rather than real
matters of supply and demand.
    "Be careful," he warned, "there's not as much coffee in the
world as they say. What there is are bags of sawdust."

producer, was disappointed by the stalemate in recent coffee
talks in London, the chairman of the state-run Coffee Marketing
Board, CMB, said.
    "This has not been good for coffee producers, more so in a
situation where the prices dropped by 200 pounds per tonne of
robusta coffee," J. Makumbi said when he returned from London on
Friday.
    Producers and consumers failed to agree on a quota formula
to share the world's coffee production during International
Coffee Organisation, ICO, talks that ended last week.
    Makumbi blamed the failure to set quotas, which were
suspended in Feburary last year, on Indonesian demands that its
quota be increased dramatically.
    Uganda -- which earns about 400 mln dlrs annually from
coffee exports, over 95 pct of its foreign exchange earnings --
had sought to raise its ICO quota to 3.0 mln from 2.45 mln
60-kilo bags, according to sources close to the CMB.
    The CMB has estimated that production will rise 20 to 25
pct in the current 1986/87 October-September season to over
three mln bags.
    For several years Uganda had been unable to meet its ICO
export quota as rebel activity disrupted the coffee industry.
    The Ugandan government depends on coffee export duties for
about 60 pct of its sales tax revenue and the industry employs
over half of salaried manpower.

1986/87 ending September 30 may fall slightly from last year's
level of 360,000 tonnes, Dharyono Kertosastro, chairman of the
Association of Indonesian Coffee Exporters told Reuters.
    He said shade trees had been damaged by pests and this may
have affected the crop, though it remains to be seen how
seriously. Indonesia's main crop is harvested next month.
    He gave no figure for expected output, except to say it
would probably be down a little from 1985/86. He said stocks
were about normal at 90,000 tonnes.
    Kertosastro predicted that exports were unlikely to rise
much from last year's level of 320,000 tonnes. "I expect exports
will be a bit more, maybe 330,000 tonnes, but not above that,"
he said. Exports in 1985/86 were valued at 944 mln U.S. Dlrs,
but the value could fall by 30 pct this year because of low
prices, he added.
    Dharyono said production was behind a five year plan target
of 420,000 tonnes for the current year, but Indonesia is trying
to boost output through introduction of higher yielding seeds,
better training for farmers and increased use of fertilizers.

preparing for a period of depressed prices while urging their
government to lobby for a resolution of the deadlocked issue of
export quotas, the chairman of the Association of Indonesian
Coffee Exporters (AICE) told Reuters.
    Dharyono Kertosastro said in an interview that Indonesia,
the world's third largest producer, is trimming costs and
improving its marketing while seeking a compromise on quotas.
    "But as long as Brazil sticks to its hardline position, we
can never bridge the gap," Dharyono said.
    Indonesia was one of a group of eight producing countries,
along with Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador,
Honduras, India, Papua New Guinea and Peru, which proposed a
new quota system at last month's failed International Coffee
Organistion (ICO) talks in London.
    Brazil, which would have had its quota reduced under the
Group of Eight scheme, blocked the proposal.
    AICE officials are now hoping Colombia can use its contacts
with Brazil to suggest a compromise.
    Edward Muda, an AICE official who attended the ICO
negotiations, said Latin American members of the Group of Eight
were in contact with Colombia, the world's second largest
producer, but gave no details.
    "Colombia has shown interest because they will gain from a
compromise. Without one, they will suffer if the present market
stays like it is," Muda said.
    He said Indonesia was in contact with consumers such as the
U.S., Japan, the Netherlands, West Germany and Canada ahead of
an ICO executive board meeting scheduled for April 1.
    Dharyono said the AICE will send delegations to the U.S.
And Japan to brief Indonesian embassy officials there and press
them to present Indonesia's case more firmly.
    He urged the Indonesian government to do more to help the
country's coffee traders through the ICO negotiations.
    Muda said the Group of Eight had some common ground with
the big consumers because they agreed on the need for basing
quotas on what he termed "realistic criteria."
    The breakaway group believes the old quota system, which
gives Brazil a 30 pct share of the quota exports, does not
reflect up-to-date supply and demand trends.
    Brazil has stuck rigidly to its insistence that the old
system be applied.
    Export quotas were suspended in February 1986 when market
prices surged because of the failure of the Brazilian crop.
    Although prices have long since come down to a point where
export controls could be reintroduced, producers and consumers
at the 75-member ICO have not been able to agree on new
guidelines. Brazil and the U.S., The largest consumer, are both
refusing to alter their positions.
    Dharyono said if new quotas are not agreed he believed
Indonesia was well placed to survive low prices.
    Indonesian farmers are trimming production costs and the
AICE is improving its marketing system, Dharyono said.
    Indonesia's coffee output in 1986/87, ending September 30,
is expected to stagnate or fall slightly from last year's level
of 360,000 tonnes, he said.
    He said stocks, at 90,000 tonnes, were about average for
the time of year.

IBC, is unlikely to disclose its future export policy until the
end of next week at the earliest, trade sources said.
    IBC president Jorio Dauster is meeting government
ministers, producers, exporters and market analysts to assess
Brazil's position in the light of the failure of talks in
London earlier this month to set new International Coffee
Organization, ICO, export quotas.
    "The failure of the talks means Brazil has got to rethink
its position completely," one Santos exporter said.
    A meeting of the National Coffee Policy Council is set for
Thursday, March 19, and Dauster will almost certainly explain
his plan to members then before announcing any new measures.
    Dauster told reporters on his return from London last week
that no decisions would be made on exports before he had held
talks with all sectors of the industry.
    Exporters said Dauster is not under any great pressure to
start marketing coffee immediately. World prices have been
recovering from the lows which followed the collapse of the ICO
talks and Brazil has sold a reasonable 5.5 mln bags of 60 kilos
for export in the first four months of this year.
    The exporters said the key factor in the eventual opening
of May and June export registrations will be the amount at
which the contribution quota is set.
    With little expectation of other sales incentive mechanisms
such as discounts, bonuses and price fall guarantees being
introduced, the level of the quota will be decisive in
determining the competitiveness of Brazilian coffee on world
markets, they said.
    They noted that on February 16, the eve of a planned
increase in the quota, April registrations were opened and
closed after 1.68 mln bags were registered for export, a record
amount for a single day.
    If May/June registrations are opened under similar
conditions as before, Brazil would have no difficulty in
selling at least 2.0 mln bags per month.
    "The problem would be how to limit sales," one exporter said.
    Brazil's present foreign trade and payments problems mean
there are pressures from the government to boost exports to
maximise foreign exchange earnings.
    However, the sources said they expect the IBC to adopt a
marketing strategy aimed at regaining Brazil's dominant
position as an exporter, but without causing a price war.
    General opinion among exporters was that Brazil would plan
to export between 17 and 18 mln bags this year of which between
1.5 and 2.0 mln would be to non-members of the ICO.
    The 15.5 mln to 16 mln bags sold to members would be around
the figure Brazil had offered to ship if ICO quotas were
reintroduced, although Dauster has said this offer expired with
the breakdown of talks.
    With the prospects of a crop of at least 28 mln bags this
year, Brazil has the capacity to export up to 20 mln bags after
meeting local consumption of around 7.0 mln, the sources added.
    However, the sources said Brazil is unlikely even to
consider exporting such quantities, as this would almost
inevitably lead to a fall in world prices as Brazil tried to
encroach on other producers' markets.
    Maximum export earnings would be achieved by orderly
marketing of traditional amounts, thus re-establishing Brazil's
market share after last year's unusually low exports of 9.9 mln
bags, enabling it to rebuild stocks and maintaining cordial
relations with the producer group which backed Brazil's stance
at the ICO talks, they added.

marketing of its coffee with the accent on more flexibility on
setting export registration prices, finance minister Cesar
Gaviria said.
    Speaking to reporters after announcing a lower export
registration price, or reintegro, of 1.10 dlr per lb ex-dock
New York, Gaviria said export mechanisms would be more agile.
    "In the first stage, we decided not only to lower the
reintegro but also to adopt a flexible policy of reintegro that
will allow private exporters to participate more actively in
Colombia's coffee export policy," he said.
    Traders said this means the export registration price will
change more often in a truer reflection of market trends.
    Gaviria said the measures merely responded to new market
factors since a return to a system of International Coffee
Organisation (ICO) export quotas may not occur in the short
term.
    ICO talks last month in London failed to break a deadlock
over re-introduction of export quotas, suspended in February
1986.
    Gaviria stressed that Colombia will not necessarily suffer
from depressed prices because it can compensate lower prices
with increased volume.
    "Colombia will continue to export its traditional amount of
coffee, between 9.6 and 10 mln bags (of 60 kilos), and will do
so without an agreement among producers," he said.
    He ruled out a much higher volume of exports, or up to 13.5
mln bags as mentioned in market circles, "because the idea is
precisely not to disrupt the market."
    Colombia exported a record 11.5 mln bags in the 1985/86
coffee year which ended last September 30.
    Echoing Gaviria's words, Jorge Cardenas, manager of the
national coffee growers' federation, said Colombia sought to
adapt its coffee marketing policy to circumstances.
    "There is great expectation in the world for the policies
that Brazil and Colombia will adopt. Ours is beginning to
emerge and no agreement among producers is foreseeable in the
immediate future," he told journalists.
    Trade sources in Rio today said Brazil's future export
policy was unlikely to be revealed before the end of next week.
    Cardenas said a new ICO meeting could only take place when
problems that hindered an agreement at the recent London talks
have been resolved.
    Asked to comment on a Reuter report from Jakarta saying
Indonesia hoped Colombia could use its contacts with Brazil to
suggest a compromise on the quota issue, Cardenas said the
Brazilian stand was quite clear.
    He said Brazil's current quota "reflects the reality of the
market, allows for an orderly supply and satisfies demand," but
added more clarity was needed to assess the criteria that
determined it.
    Cardenas said lows registered immediately after the failure
of the London talks were triggered by a widespread fear among
dealers of an imminent price war and the belief that producers
would go out and sell their coffee as quickly as possible,
which did not happen.

exports through a ferry link with the Kenyan port of Kisumu
across Lake Victoria, Ugandan officials based in Kenya said.
    Uganda has a direct rail link with the Kenyan port of
Mombasa through which it conducts 70 pct of its external trade

    Customs at Kisumu take less than a day compared with two to

plies between Kisumu and the Ugandan port of Jinja, causing
bottlenecks on the lake route too.
    Sources at the Coffee Marketing Board in Kampala reported
delays in coffee export shipments last January due to
congestion on the lake ferries.
    Coffee accounts for about 95 pct of Uganda's export
earnings and last November President Yoweri Museveni ordered
all coffee shipments to be carried by rail in order to avoid

export registrations for an unlimited amount does not imply the
country will heavily sell coffee until recently withheld,
Gilberto Arango, president of the private exporters'

    Colombia today opened export registrations for april and
may, with the National Coffee Growers' Federation setting no
limit.
    Since the start of the coffee year last october, private
exporters were on average allowed 350,000 bags of 60 kilos per
month.
    "Traders will initially interpret this measure as announcing
heavy sales. Even today it pressured the market. But it will
quickly become apparent that Colombia does not intend to go
over the top," Arango said in an interview.
    "Colombia's marketing policy is to sell without haste but
consistently. No targets for volume will be set. We will react
to market factors adequately. Colombia has no intention to give
its coffee away," he added.
    Arango described measures adopted here yesterday, including
a lower export registration price, as a major change in
Colombia's coffee marketing policy.
    The export registration price, or reintegro, was lowered to
1.10 dlr per lb ex-dock new york, or 155.83 dlrs per bag of 70
kilos, from 1.35 dlrs (194.33 dlrs).
    The government announced a more flexible policy of
reintegro, in order to closely reflect market trends, which
arango warmly welcomed saying private exporters will
undoubtedly be more actively present in the market.
    A frequent gap between international market prices and the
reintegro was unlikely to recur, he said.

    The government lowered local taxes for exporters and said
the export registration price, or reintegro, will be changed
more often in order to closely reflect market trends.
    Arango said an illustration of Colombia's new attitude was
the decision on Friday to open export registrations for an
unlimited amount.
    But he added it did not imply the country would begin heavy
selling of coffee.
    "Our marketing policy is to sell without haste but
consistently. No targets for volume will be set. We will react
to market factors adequately and Colombia has no intention of
giving its coffee away."
    Colombia's past records should be the basis for upcoming
exports, he said.
    "We will certainly not export seven mln (60-kilo) bags but
neither are we going to sell like mad. The trade knows full
well what Colombia's export potential is," he said.
    Colombia, with stockpiles standing at about 10 mln bags,
exported a record 11.5 mln bags in the 1985/86 coffee year
which ended last September, and 11.3 mln in calendar 1986.
    Arango did not want to commit himself on export predictions
but said that output for the 1986/87 coffee year would not
exceed 10.5 mln bags, compared with 12 mln forecast by the
National Coffee Growers' Federation and 12.5 mln by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture, a figure he said was "ridiculous."
    He said ageing plantations and rust, in particular in the
number one producing province of Antioquia, meant output was
likely to fall but that nationwide estimates were rare and
oscillated between 9.5 mln and 11.5 mln bags.
    On the failure of the recent ICO talks, Arango said
Colombia understandably felt frustrated at not having managed
to force a compromise.
    Jorge Cardenas, manager of the national federation and head
of his nation's delegation in London, has blamed the
intransigence of some big countries, without naming them.
    However, Arango, like Colombian Finance Minister Cesar
Gaviria last week, was more explicit and said the United States
would undoubtedly be under great political pressure in coming
weeks to revise its policy.
    "Washington will have to take into account that for many
countries, and some of its allies for instance in Central
America, a sharp fall in coffee export revenue would have
far-reaching political and economic consequences."
    Arango ruled out a fresh Colombian initiative on export
quotas saying producers had now to show a common resolve which
could emerge from continuous contacts.

output is estimated at 80,725 tonnes this year, down from
82,210 in 1986, due to a rundown of government agricultural

Agriculture Ministry sources said.
    This is after accounting for the loss of some 15,000 to
20,000 tonnes due to the transport problems in the countryside,
they said.
    The sources did not give an estimate for exports in 1987,
but they noted that shipments declined to 37,200 tonnes last
year from 41,662 in 1985.
    Low yields from the country's ageing coffee plantations and
prevalence of the fungal disease Hemileia Vastatrix also
contributed to the poor performance, the sources said.
    They pointed out that 52 pct of Madagascar's coffee bushes
were planted before 1930.
    The sources said Madagascar was still a long way from
reaching the production target of 110,000 tonnes per year and
the export target of 63,000 tonnes outlined in the government's
1986-1990 five-year plan.
    In order to reverse the decline in coffee production, the
government has decided to plant 20,000 hectares with
high-yielding arabica and canephora varieties, the sources
said.
    The planting programme will begin this year and is aimed at
producing 300 to 360 kilos per hectare of beans with a low

    Nicaraguan Foreign Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca
was in London to brief International Coffee Organisation (ICO)
executive board producer members after a meeting last weekend
in Managua attended by eight Latin American coffee producers to
discuss the fall in coffee prices.
    London coffee prices slid 300 stg per tonne in March, to
1,279 stg from 1,580 stg at end-February.
    Martinez told reporters the price fall since the ICO failed
to agree export quotas on March 1 has had disastrous results on
Latin America, both economically and politically.
    He urged continued negotiations among coffee producers to
pave the way for a coffee export quota agreement by September.
    Coffee export quotas, used to regulate coffee prices under
an International Coffee Agreement, were suspended a year ago
when prices soared in response to a drought in Brazil.
    Central American economic ministers have estimated the
region will lose 720 mln dlrs in foreign exchange earnings in
1987 if coffee prices are not rescued by a quota arrangement,
Martinez said.
    He said ICO quota talks broke down last month because
consumer members lack the political will to fully support

    The official, a member of the U.S. delegation to ICO talks

positions of major producers and consumers have changed.
    The U.S. still demands, as a condition of reimposition of

establishing quotas, said the U.S. official, who asked not to

Organization, ICO, executive board meeting this week will agree
to resume negotiations on export quotas soon look remote, ICO
delegates and trade sources said.
    ICO observers doubted Brazil or key consuming countries are
ready to give sufficient ground to convince the other side that
reopening negotiations again would be worthwhile, they said.
    ICO talks on quotas last month broke down after eight days
when producers and consumers failed to reach agreement.
     "Since we have not seen signs of change in other positions,
it's difficult to see a positive outcome at this stage,"
Brazilian delegate Lindenberg Sette said. But quotas must be
negotiated sometime, he said.
     The U.S. has indicated it is open to dialogue on quotas
but that Brazil must be flexible, rather than refuse to lower
its export share as it did in the last negotiations, delegates
said.
     At this week's March 31-April 2 meeting, the 16-member ICO
board is scheduled to discuss the current market situation, the
reintroduction of quotas, verification of stocks and some
administrative matters, according to a draft agenda.
    The fact that Brazilian Coffee Institute president Jorio
Dauster, Assistant U.S. Trade Representative Jon Rosenbaum and
chief Colombian delegate Jorge Cardenas are not attending the
meeting has signalled to most market watchers that it will be a
non-event as far as negotiating quotas is concerned.
    "I would imagine there will be a lot of politicking among
producers behind closed doors to work up some kind of proposal
by September (the next scheduled council meeting)," Bronwyn
Curtis of Landell Mills Commodities Studies said.
    Traders and delegates said they have seen no sign that a
date will be set for an earlier council meeting.
    If the stalemate continues much longer, analysts expect the
coffee agreement will end up operating without quotas for the
remainder of its life, to September 30, 1989.
    When talks broke down, the U.S. and Brazil, the largest
coffee consumer and producer respectively, blamed one another
for sabotaging negotiations by refusing to compromise.
    Brazil wanted to maintain the previous export quota shares,
under which it was allocated 30 pct of world coffee exports,
but consumers and a small group of producers pressed for shares
to be redistributed using "objective criteria," which would have
threatened Brazil's share.
    At a recent meeting in Managua of Latin American producers,
Costa Rica and Honduras said they were willing to put their
objections as members of the group of eight ICO "dissident"
producers aside, in order to stem the damaging decline in
prices, Nicaraguan External Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez
Cuenca told reporters Saturday. He was in London to brief
producers on the Managua meeting.
    However, other producers said they were not aware of this
move toward producer solidarity.

IBC, is expected to maintain its previous pricing system when
it reopens export registrations, probably later this week,
exporters said.
    They said IBC President Jorio Dauster is likely to leave
the basic formula for the minimum registration price unchanged
but raise the contribution quota to partially offset the
effects of cruzado devaluation since April registrations were
closed in mid-February.
    To fully compensate for devaluation the quota would have to
be around 28 dlrs per bag against 7.0 when registrations closed.
    However, even a 21 dlr per bag rise in the contribution
quota would make Brazil coffees uncompetitive on world markets,
and an increase to around 15 dlrs a bag is more likely, the
exporters said.
    They added that Dauster is keen to raise the contribution
quota as the Institute needs money to repay Central Governmnet
funds released to finance IBC purchases at the guaranteed
producer price.
    Although a vote in the Monetary Council to provide more
funds for such purchases was deferred on technical grounds last
week, funds are still being released for subsequent approval.
    The sources said it is still unclear when registrations
will be reopened, although most expect it to be by the end of
this week.
    "Brazil owes it to its customers to make its intentions
know. A country like Brazil cannot afford to be permanently
closed down," one exporter said.
    However, before announcing its export policy the IBC is
likely to wait to see if tomorrow's meeting of the
International Coffee Organisation, ICO, executive board in
London decides to call a full council meeting to discuss
reintroduction of export quotas, sources said.
    There is also talk of the announcement this week of new
measures to adjust the Brazilian economy, and the IBC could be
awaiting clarification before making any move, the exporters
said.
    Another factor which could be delaying the opening of
registrations is the current strike by bank workers which,
while not affecting current shipments, could affect
documentation and currency operations for new sales.
    This would certainly be the case if the IBC was considering
obliging exporters to pay the contribution quota within two or
three days of registering a sale.

International Coffee Organization, ICO, passed over the issue
of export quota negotiations at its regular meeting here,
delegates said.
    No move was made to reopen dialogue on export quotas and no
further discussion on the issue is likely during the three-day
talks, they said.
    Producer and consumer members of the ICO council failed to
agree export quota shares in early March.
    Neither Brazil, the largest producer, nor the U.S., the
largest consumer, are ready to be flexible, delegates said.
    "The situation is unchanged," consumer spokesman Abraham Van
Overbeeke told reporters. "As long as Brazil sticks to its
position there will not be quotas -- there is no point in
meeting."
    At the last council meeting, Brazil wanted to maintain its
previous quota share of around 30 pct of the market. Consumers
and a splinter group of eight producers favoured redistribution
of export shares using "objective criteria," which would likely
have reduced Brazil's share.
    Brazilian delegate Lindenberg Sette said that, if quota
negotiations were to resume, the 1.0 mln bag shortfall Brazil
was willing to give up in early March if the producer proposal
was accepted would no longer be on the table.
    "As we said from the start...No agreement, no one million
bags," he told Reuters.
    Shortfalls of 200,000 bags offered by OAMCAF, the African
and Malagasy Coffee Organization, and 20,000 bags offered by
Angola, are also no longer valid, delegates said.
    The closest the board came to discussing quotas was a
briefing by the Guatemalan ICO delegate Rene Montes on a recent
Latin American producers meeting in Managua, delegates said.
    There, the producers expressed their political will to
negotiate basic quotas, particularly in the face of the
damaging drop in coffee prices after the council failed to
agree quotas, Montes said.

verification. They expected talks on stock verification to take

    The Brazilian delegate said several producers requested the

board's regular session this week has so far been confined to
routine matters, with no attempt by producers or consumers to
revive export quota negotiations, delegates said.
    Talks to restore quotas collapsed early last month when

before the end of the current 1986/87 coffee year (Oct 1/Sept
30) now seems unlikely, given reluctance by International
Coffee Organization, ICO, producers and consumers to resume
negotiations on an interim quota accord, producer delegates
told reporters.
    Consumers and most producers see no point in reopening the
quota dialogue while Brazil's position remains unchanged, they
said.
    Brazil's refusal to accept a reduction in its previous 30
pct share of the ICO's global export quota effectively
torpedoed talks here last month aimed at restoring quotas
before October, the delegates noted.
    Disappointment at the lack of progress on quotas forced
coffee futures in London and New York to new lows today,
traders here said. Near May in New York fell below one dlr in
early trading at around 99.10 cents per pound, traders said.
    Producer delegates said that while the possibility of
reimposing quotas before October remained on the ICO agenda, in
practice the idea had effectively been discarded.
    The ICO's executive board session here this week has so far
barely touched on the quota debate, demonstrating general
unwillingness to revive talks while chances of success are
still remote, producer delegates said.
    Some producers are in no hurry to see quotas restored,
despite the price collapse seen since the failure of last
month's negotiations, they said.
    "With Brazil's frost season approaching, who wants to
negotiate quotas," one leading producer delegate said.
    Coffee prices normally rise during Brazil's frost season
(mainly June-August) as dealers and roasters build up stocks as
insurance against possible severe frost damage to Brazil's
crop.
    Many producers are more interested in working towards
reimposing quotas from October 1, based on a new system of
quota allocations valid until the International Coffee
Agreement expires in 1989, they said.
    Guatemala has already proposed the "other oilds" producer
group should meet in the next two months to begin talks on how
to allocate quota shares.
    Producers still seem divided on how to overhaul the quota
distribution system, with some producer delegates reporting
growing support for a radical reallocation, based on the
principle of "objective criteria" favoured by consumers.
    At last month's council session a splinter group of small
producers backed consumer demands for new quota shares based on
exportable production and stocks, while Brazil, Colombia and
the rest of the producers favoured leaving quota allocations
unchanged, except for some temporary adjustments.
    A delegate from one of the eight said more producers now
supported their cause.
    The delegate said unless major producers like Brazil showed
readiness to negotiate new quota shares, prospects for a quota
accord in October also looked bleak.
    The U.S. and most other consumers are still determined to
make reimposition of quotas conditional on a redistribution of
quota shares based on "objective criteria."
    ICO observers remained sceptical that Brazil would be
prepared to accept a quota reduction when the ICO council meets
in September.
    Brazil has adopted a tough stance with banks on external
debt negotiations and is likely to be just as tough on coffee,
they said.
    They said Brazil's reluctance to open coffee export
registrations might reflect fears this would provoke another
price slide and force an emergency ICO council session, which
would most likely end in failure.
    Producers met this afternoon to review the market situation
but had only a general discussion about how further
negotiations should proceed, a producer delegate said.
    Producers plan to hold consultations on quotas, and then
may set a date for a formal producer meeting, but plans are not
fixed, he said.
    The ICO executive board reconvened at 1650 hours local time
to hear a report from consultants on ICO operations. The board
meeting looks set to end today, a day earlier than scheduled,
delegates said.

probably fall to about 85 cents a lb in the next month before a
consolidation trend sets in, according to market analysts.
    Yesterday, prices for the spot May contract fell below 1.00
dlr a lb for the first time since August 1981 after the
International Coffee Organization did not place new export
quota discussions on its current agenda.
    Talks aimed at renegotiating ICO export quotas, after five
years of price-supporting agreements, broke down in February.
    "Short-term, it looks like a definite test of 90 cents,
perhaps 85 cents," said William O'Neill, coffee analyst with
Elders Futures. "But the additional downside may not be all
that great from current levels."
    "At this price level the market is very vulnerable to
bullish developments," O'Neill added. "Rather than us having a
market that will plummet we'll kind of see prices erode --
probably to around 85 cents."
    "I definitely see 90 cents and would not rule out a brief
drop to 85 cents," said Debra Tropp, a coffee analyst with
Prudential Bache. But she said by June worries about a freeze
in Brazil growing areas will become more of a market factor,
with prices likely to consolidate ahead of that time.
    A trader at a major international trade house, who asked
not to be named, said he expects a 10 cent drop near term but
believes if Brazil opens May registrations at a relatively high
export price and requires a high contribution quota from
exporters the market could steady at the lower levels.
    Longer term, he added, producer pressure will mount on
Brazil to agree to consumers' export quota terms, and a new
international agreement could come into force next fall.
    Since the February talks broke down, the market has fallen
from about 130.00 cents a lb to a low of 98.10 cents a lb
today, as buyers and sellers sought to reassess supply and
demand.
    Generally, analysts say, producers have a large buildup of
stocks, but U.S. roasters have drawn down supplies and will
need to do some buying soon.
    "Most producing nations have just completed or are about to
complete their annual harvests and exportable supplies are at
their seasonal peak. Exports remain behind year ago and
warehouses in producer nations are becoming increasingly
overburdened," said Sandra Kaul, coffee analyst for Shearson
Lehman, in that firm's forthcoming quarterly coffee report.
    Kaul said producers' need to procure hard currency to
service foreign debt will put further pressure on them to sell,
and "this should keep substantial pressure on exporters to
undertake sales despite the drop in prices to six year lows."
    Kaul believes the market will drop to 80 cents a lb before
Brazil's frost season begins in June.
    Accurate assessments of roaster demand are hard to come by,
though analysts note the peak winter consumption period is
passed and demand usually slows this time of year.
    Shearson's Kaul estimated U.S. roaster ending stocks as of
January 31, including soluble and roasted, at 6.3 mln bags
compared with 6.9 mln at end-September 1986, a small drawdown
for the usually busy winter roasting season.
    But Elders O'Neill said, "The roasters are not overstocked
by any means."
    Analysts said picking a bottom to the market is difficult,
given the fact prices have fallen into uncharted territory
below the long-term support at 1.00 dlr per lb, and several
traders said the sidelines might be preferable for the short
term.

the International Coffee Organisation (ICO) would not reimpose
export quotas even though this may lead to a further slump in
world prices.
    Susin Suratanakaweekul, president of the Thai Coffee
Exporters Association, told Reuters that Thailand obtained
little benefit from previous ICO quotas which represented only
about 30 pct of its total annual exports.
    Thailand expects increased overall coffee export revenue if
there are no restrictions on sales to current ICO members who
offer higher prices than non-members, he said.
    The Customs Department said Thailand exported 21,404 tonnes
of coffee last year, up from 20,602 in 1985.
    Thai coffee production is projected to fall to about 25,000
tonnes in the 1986/87 (Oct/Sept) season from 28,000 the
previous year.
    However, a senior Commerce Ministry official said the Thai
government supports coffee producers' lobbying for reimposed
ICO quotas which, he said, would help lift world prices.
    Somphol Kiatpaiboon, director general of the Commercial
Economics Department, said an absence of ICO quotas would
encourage producers to rapidly release coffee on to the market,
further depressing prices.
    He said Indonesia is expected to export a substantial
amount of coffee this month without such restrictions.

 ]]></BODY><BODY><![CDATA[Coffee prices look set to continue
sliding in the near term, given the lack of progress towards a
new International Coffee Organization (ICO) export quota
accord, according to coffee traders and analysts.
    Robusta coffee futures dipped sharply to 4-1/2 year lows
yesterday at 1,220 stg per tonne, basis the May position, when
the lack of new debate on quotas at ICO talks here confirmed
expectations that efforts to restore quotas would not be
revived at this stage, they said.
    The 15-day ICO average composite price fell to 99.69 cents
a lb for April 1, the lowest for 5-1/2 years.
    Quotas will not now be renegotiated before the ICO's annual
September council session, and in the interim the Brazilian
frost season from June to August may prove the only bullish
factor to stem further price weakness, they said. Futures
bounced back from the lows today towards the previous trading
range around 1,260/1,270 stg per tonne on May as the market
recovered from yesterday's "confidence blip," one trader
commented.
    But despite today's upturn, the overall trend is for lower
prices in the near future, one trade source said.
    The market had become increasingly vulnerable to
yesterday's shakeout, having held within a 1,250/1,350 stg
second position trading range for 22 successive sessions, he
said.
    Technically the market is more likely to decline further as
it absorbs today's brief rally. Steep declines towards the
1,100/1,050 stg area could foster a "three figure mentality," and
speculators may elect to push for coffee prices below the
psychological 1,000 stg level, he added.
    Some traders said today's upturn was in part due to
Brazil's opening last night of May green coffee export
registrations.
     This had been widely anticipated by the market and came as
no surprise, but it did remove some prevailing uncertainty and
light trade buying was seen this morning as a consequence.
    However, the overall trend remains downwards and a test of
support at 1,200 stg should be expected soon, with the only
possible supportive influence on the horizon being the approach
of Brazil's frost season, they said.
    Roasters are believed to be well covered, limiting
activities to modest hand-to-mouth purchases and generally not
taking up producer offers, they added.
    Central American producers have sold the bulk of their
current crops, but robusta producers in West Africa and
Indonesia need to sell coffee for April through July shipment,
and this could pressure prices further, traders said.
    However, one dealer, although seeing no reason to be
bullish, advised caution. "Everybody's bearish now, just as they
were bullish when the market was at 3,100 stg," he said.
    Arthur Cherry, coffee analyst at E.D. and F. Man, expressed
doubts the price spiral would continue much below current
levels. "One dlr coffee is catastrophic for many producers --
there must be a minimum below which prices cannot fall."
    While prices dropped to the lowest levels since September
1982 yesterday, manufacturers have no plans to cut their retail
prices.
    "Its impossible to say, we can't predict anything like that
at this stage," a General Foods spokesman said.
    Manufacturers have lowered prices recently anyway in
response to market weakness. At the beginning of March the
price of a 100 gram jar of coffee was cut to 1.55 stg from 1.65
stg in Britain. But should coffee market prices continue to
fall, the situation would be reviewed, the spokesman added.
    Nestle also has no plans to make additional price cuts in
the near future.
    "The market seems to have established some equilibrium and
doesn't look set to go much lower," a Nestle spokesman
commented.
    Coffee's plunge this week has been mirrored by tea, which
fell to a 5-1/2 year low at today's auction at 1.18 stg per
kilo for medium quality, traders added.

Dijon mustard or Tuborg beer on their weekly trip to the
supermarket are soon to be the target of a promotional blitz
for national-brand "gourmet" coffees.
    General Foods, the largest U.S. coffee roaster, and A and
P, which shares the third place in the U.S. market, are the
only two national brand roasters so far to introduce the
higher-quality coffees into selected supermarkets.
    But industry insiders believe there is substantial growth
potential in upscale coffee, despite years of flat sales in
regular ground roast types.
    "I would suspect General Foods will make a name for
themselves with their gourmet line," said a coffee trade
source. "What it could do is really dent the small-store,
whole-bean business," the trade source added.
    The new lines are designed to appeal to a classic
advertising composite--the "yuppie" consumer.
    They buy fresh pasta, subscribe to Bon Appetit magazine and
were "first on their block with a wok," as described by Karin
Brown, General Foods senior product manager for its new coffee,
called Private Collection out of GF's Maxwell House division.
    Paul Gallant, president of A and P's Compass Foods
subsidiary that makes the new A and P gourmet line, described
its potential appeal as "a status thing."
    At an initial price of 4.99 dlrs for 12 ounces it is
expensive, though not more so than high quality coffee sold in
small specialty stores. General Foods' Maxwell House Div. has
just cut the price on its new offering by 50 cents to 4.49 dlrs
for 12 ounces--a move competitor A and P is bound to imitate,
according to an A and P executive.
    Number two U.S. roaster Folgers has "nothing to announce at
this point" in the gourmet line, a spokesman said. Neither does
Hills Bros., a subsidiary of Nestle that shares the third and
fourth size market spot by volume with A and P.
    Competitors believe Folgers will watch the progress of
General Foods' offering, prepared to jump in if the market
takes off.
    General Foods and A and P hope their new products will help
push coffee sales out of the doldrums. Coffee consumption in
the United States has fallen 44 pct since 1962, according to a
1986 study by the International Coffee Organization. Sales show
no signs of picking up.
    Compass's Gallant blames the falloff on declines in coffee
quality since the 1960's and aggressive soft drink marketing.
    "The national brands began to cheapen the blend in the name
of profit but spent 100 mln dlrs a year telling consumers this
was quality coffee," Gallant said.
    As a result, first time consumers never got a taste for the
brew. The first time a young consumer tries coffee, "they turn
around and say 'My God this is awful, I think I'll have a
Coke'," he said.
    Having now mostly written off the 16-25 age group, who have
confirmed their loyalty to soft drinks, coffee marketers are
aiming at the high income, free-spending, self-treating crowd
-- the yuppie composite.
    "Where else are you going to go?," an industry source said.
"Kids aren't going to drink coffee, that's apparent. There are
no other markets. The only area that's not been promoted is
gourmet," he said.
    In addition to perking up sales, success in the gourmet
line could provide much higher margins to roasters than regular
ground roast coffees produce.
    Generally, retail prices are about twice the price of
green, unroasted coffee beans, taking into account the costs of
roasting, packaging and distribution, and then deducting
often-generous trade discounts. Supermarkets tend to sell
coffee near the trade price as a "loss leader," a product
designed to draw shoppers into the store.
    But with the new gourmet lines, a different pricing
structure prevails, industry sources said. There is no trade
discounting and an emphasis on expensive packaging, including a
special valve designed to keep the beans fresher.
    Dealers said roasters were buying the higher quality green
beans at about 1.60 dlrs a lb. Thus, retail prices on gourmet
coffee are now almost three times the price of green.
    Targetted consumers seem willing to pay the difference.
General Foods claims 80 pct of consumers in their test market
surveys for Private Collection came back for more.
    And product manager Brown points to the success of more
expensive beers, mustard and ice cream, that began selling in
restricted high income areas and are now available in almost
every supermarket in the country.
    A and P is similarly optimistic. "We think we'll do
extremely well in the gourmet market," Gallant said.
    Maxwell House is marketing its eight types of Private
Collection in selected high income areas, while A and P offers
its 14 different whole bean gourmet coffees, called 8 O'Clock
Royale, only in their own stores in Philadelphia, Baltimore,
New York, Atlanta and some other metropolitan areas.

quotas and higher local prices, ICO Certifying Agency official
Dante de Guzman told Reuters.
    He said exporter registrations dropped from an average
weekly 500 tonnes in March to 45 tonnes last week, with exports
in coffee year 1986/87, ending September, forecast to total
about 8,000 tonnes against 48,000 in 1985/86.
     "Because of the relatively higher level of domestic prices,
it has become difficult to service exports," de Guzman said,
adding that most exporters are taking a wait and see attitude.
    Coffee production was expected to drop slightly to about
one mln bags of 60 kg each in the 1986/87 crop year ending June
from 1.1 mln bags last year, he said.

has stopped offering coffee on the international market because
it is unhappy with current prices, coffee trade sources said.
    The board suspended offerings last week but because of its
urgent need for cash it was not immediately clear how long it
could sustain, the sources added.
    Hundreds of Ugandan coffee farmers and processors have been
waiting several months for payment from the CMB, which has had
trouble finding enough railway wagons to move the coffee to the
Kenyan port of Mombasa.
    Foreign banks have contributed to the cash crisis by
holding up remittance of Uganda's hard currency earnings from
coffee exports, the government newspaper New Vision said.
    The banks are holding up to seven mln dlrs in coffee money
and President Yoweri Museveni is thinking of imposing a penalty
for such delays, it added.
    Banking sources said a third factor in the crisis was that
commercial banks have lent the board only 77 billion shillings
-- the equivalent of 55 mln dlrs -- for crop finance in the
current coffee year, while the government had asked for 100
billion.
    The CMB has 455,000 60-kg bags of coffee, about 15 pct of
annual production, stockpiled in Kampala awaiting shipment.
    The crop accounts for over 90 pct of Uganda's export
earnings and the recent slide in prices to four-year lows is
likely to more than offset an expected increase in production.
    CMB officials have forecast that because the government has
restored law and order in important growing areas, Uganda will
produce over three mln bags of coffee in the year ending
September 30, about 25 pct more than in 1985/6.

 ]]></BODY><BODY><![CDATA[European coffee traders and roasters
may propose a new formula for calculating International Coffee
Organization (ICO) coffee quotas at the end of their meeting
here this week, traders and officials told Reuters.
    Although traders were unwilling to reveal details of the
possible new formula, they said it would give Brazil, the
world's biggest coffee producer, unchanged ICO quotas for the
next two years and could be a basis for renegotiation.
    "The main sticking point on quotas has been Brazil's
attitude, and this compromise could be a solution, " one said.
    However, the European coffee trade federation meeting,
which began here today and is to continue to the end of the
week, has revealed gaps in the European position on
re-introducing quotas.
    Traders said that, as a whole, the trade side was against
re-introduction of ICO quotas, while roasters were generally in
favour with the single proviso that there had to be some
formula basis for re-allocating quota shares among producing
countries.
    The roasters said the positions were generally fairly
close, and problems with some Government officials.
    Germany and Italy were cited as the extremes of polarized
Government attitudes, with most other countries on the fence.
    Sources said Germany was the most extreme against quota
re-introduction, while the Italians were most in favour.
    "Nevertheless, we expect to find enough common ground by the
end of the week to at least present a common European Community
(EC) view at the next meeting of consumer members of the
International Coffee Agreement (ICA) in July," one trader said.
    "We hope we can present the compromise proposal and that not
only the consumer side, but the producer side will accept it,"
one official said.
    "We have learned that we can live without the quotas that
were suspended in February last year, but would prefer the
stability they can bring to the market as long as we do not
simply return to the old and outdated status quo as far as
quota allocation is concerned," he added.
    Overall, however, trader and roaster opinion on the
likelihood of a successful re-negotiation was mildly
pessimistic, varying between a 50-50 chance and 60-40 against.
    "Our main difficulty will be to persuade the U.S. On the
consumer side and Brazil on the producer side to agree to quota
re-introduction, " he said.
    "The U.S. Position has, if anything, hardened, while the new
Brazilian Coffee Institute president has adopted the least
negotiable position of any of his predecessors," one trader
said.
    "However, with many producers starting to swing in favour of
the consumer position that quotas have to be re-allocated under
a new formula, Brazil is becoming increasingly isolated, which
gives at least some hope of a compromise at the ICO quota
meeting in September," the official said.

 ]]></BODY><BODY><![CDATA[European coffee roasters and traders
have agreed to propose a new formula for calculating
International Coffee Organization, ICO, quotas, Dutch Coffee
Trade Association chairman chairman Frits van Horick said.
    Van Horick, who is a council member of the European Coffee
Federation, was speaking at the end of the ECF annual meeting.
    The new formula is based on six-year moving averages and
would give Brazil, the world's biggest coffee producer, an
unchanged quota for the remaining two years of the current
coffee agreement, van Horick said.
    If accepted by the consumer and producer members of the
ICO, the formula could also be a basis for negotiating a new
agreement, van Horick said.
    Coffee quotas were suspended in February last year when
prices shot up on fears of a drought-induced crop disaster in
Brazil.
    Although prices are now considerably lower, consumers and
producers have been unable to agree on re-introduction.
    "Brazil has been the most strongly against any change in the
formula because it feared a lower quota. But our proposal
leaves it very little to object to," van Horick said.
    "The existing quota system is far too rigid and does not
reflect supply and demand reality," he said. "Our formula
builds flexibility into the system and will benefit almost
everyone."
    Although full implications of the new formula have still to
be worked out, initial estimates suggest countries such as
Colombia, Kenya, Indonesia and Costa Rica would get slightly
higher quotas, while others such as the Ivory Coast, El
Salvador and Nicaragua would lose quota share, van Horick said.
    Because the proposal provides that future quota
distribution must reflect current demand and actual supply, it
should also prevent under-shipment of quota as countries doing
so would automatically prejudice their following year's quota.
    "If the ICO consumers accept our proposal it stands at least
a fair chance of being accepted by the producers at the
September meeting, most of whom are generally in favour of a
new quota formula, " van Horick said.
    At the same time much will depend on Brazil's attitude.
    "Brazil is increasingly isolated on the producer side. If
there is no frost damage to its coffee crop over the next two
months and most other producers favour our proposal, we might
just get an agreement," van Horick added.

responsible for coffee policy said prospects for an accord on
coffee quotas are still uncertain despite recent Colombian
efforts to bridge differences between producers and consumers.
    Jon Rosenbaum, an assistant U.S. trade representative just
back from trade talks in Colombia, said most producing
countries now accept some sort of standardized criteria must be
agreed to reintroduce coffee quotas.
    "There is one country which evidently still does not,"
Rosenbaum said in an obvious reference to Brazil, which has
been negative recently on a reintroduction of quotas.
    Rosenbaum said because of the stance of Brazil the outlook
for an agreement to reintroduce coffee quotas at the September
International Coffee Organization meeting is hard to predict.
    He said that during the visit to Bogota he held technical
discussions with Colombian officials.
    While he did not meet with Jorge Cardenas, head of the
Colombian coffee producers federation, who was in Europe,
Cardenas left a "positive letter," Rosenbaum said.
    The Cardenas letter responded to a U.S. letter last month
which praised Colombia for trying to find a compromise formula
for the reintroduction of quotas, but outlined several concerns
with the technical details of the Colombian plan.
    Rosenbaum could not be reached later in the day for comment
on a new formula for calculating ICO quotas agreed to by
European coffee roasters and traders.
    Dutch coffee trade association chairman Frits van Horick
said in Amsterdam the new formula is based on six year moving
averages and would give Brazil an unchanged export quota for
the remaining to years of the current coffee agreement.
    The U.S. has said it will not agree to any coffee quotas
unless "objective criteria" which reflect recent changes in the
coffee market are used to set export limits.

monitoring U.S. coffee imports under quotas is viewed
skeptically by many in the coffee industry, said analysts and
trade sources.
    "Many sectors of the trade, including large roasters and 
importers, are adamant against voluntary compliance because of
the past, which was subject to tremendous irregularities as it
became a matter of the trade monitoring each other," one
analyst said.
    On Monday, a National Coffee Association newsletter said
the Office of U.S. Trade Representative will implement a
voluntary compliance system temporarily because legislation to
monitor imports is tied up in the Congressional trade bill.
    Under the arrangement, milar to one in 1980, coffee
importers would voluntarily present needed documents to the
U.S. government until Congress approves the monitoring
authority, but if coffee arrives without valid certification,
it will still be allowed entry.
    While many believe producers will not seek to add to the
overburdened stock situation in the U.S., others believe some
will ship outside of the quota requirements in lieu of
monitoring controls, trade sources said.
    "Last time, there was a lot of false information submitted
to customs which resulted in a lot of indictments and fines," a
U.S. Customs spokesman said.
    "Customs can do a good job when given the tools, but when
its hands are tied, it doesn't have the authority to demand
Form O (documents tracking merchandise from source to
destination)," he said.
    Many see it as a true test of whether producers and
importers will abide by the quota system.
    "It is a key to seeing whether there are any teeth in the
quota agreement," said one major U.S. roaster.
     "Last time we had a gentleman's agreement, the trade did
not act as a gentleman," said another analyst adding, "without
the need to submit documents, the ball will be in the
producers' hands."
    Some feel that importers will take advantage of the
voluntary compliance due to development of a two-tier market,
in which non-member countries buy coffee at a big discount.
Many fear that dealers will buy coffee destined for non-member
countries at discounts and then bring it into the U.S. falsely
labelled.
    According to customs officials, several green coffee
importers confessed in 1985 that they had imported coffee
fraudulently after buying it for non-member destinations,
forging landing certificates and then relabelling it as navy
beans.
    "If there's that much of a discrepancy between prices for
one country and another, producers may be teted to get rid of
their stocks of coffee by selling to non-member nations and by
circumventing the quota provisions," said Paine Webber analyst
Bernie Savaiko.
    Still, others believe that producers will not be hard
pressed to aggravate the overburdened coffee stock situation in
the U.S. in the near term.
    "It would be naive to suggest that any agreement would not
have some share of connivance, but I think the voluntary system
seemed to suffice and, coupled with the fact that we have so
much coffee, I don't think that it poses that much of a
threat," one trader said.

(IBC) has given shippers until close of business on Thursday to
submit details of past export performance in order that
individual quotas can be allocated, an IBC spokesman said.
    He told Reuters IBC President Jorio Dauster has confirmed

to establish individual export quotas based 65 pct on export

    Shippers can choose their best period of 12 consecutive
